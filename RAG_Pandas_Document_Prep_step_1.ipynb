Tolkien \\n\\n540 \\n\\nCopyright \\n\\n541 \\n\\nAbout  The  Publisher \\n\\n542 \\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  TEXT \\n\\n\\nJ.R.R.  Tolkien’s  The  Lord  of  the  Rings  is  often  erroneously \\ncalled  a  trilogy,  when  it  is  in  fact  a  single  novel,  consisting \\nof  six  books  plus  appendices,  sometimes  published  in  three \\nvolumes. \\n\\nThe  first  volume,  The  Fellowship  of  the  Ring ,  was  published \\nin  Great  Britain  by  the  London  firm  George  Allen  &amp;  Unwin \\non  29  July  1954;  an  American  edition  followed  on  21  October \\nof  the  same  year,  published  by  Houghton  Mifflin  Company \\nof  Boston.  In  the  production  of  this  first  volume,  Tolkien \\nexperienced  what  became  for  him  a  continual  problem: \\nprinter’s  errors  and  compositor’s  mistakes,  including  well- \\nintentioned  ‘corrections’  of  his  sometimes  idiosyncratic \\nusage.  These  ‘corrections’  include  the  altering  of  dwarves  to \\ndwarfs,  elvish  to  elfish,  further  to  farther,  nasturtians  to  nastur¬ \\ntiums,  try  and  say  to  try  to  say  and  (‘worst  of  all’  to  Tolkien) \\nelven  to  elfin.  In  a  work  such  as  The  Lord  of  the  Rings, \\ncontaining  invented  languages  and  delicately  constructed \\nnomenclatures,  errors  and  inconsistencies  impede  both  the \\nunderstanding  and  the  appreciation  of  serious  readers  -  and \\nTolkien  had  many  such  readers  from  very  early  on.  Even \\nbefore  the  publication  of  the  third  volume,  which  contained \\nmuch  hitherto  unrevealed  information  on  the  invented  lan¬ \\nguages  and  writing  systems,  Tolkien  received  many  letters \\nfrom  readers  written  in  these  systems,  in  addition  to  numer¬ \\nous  enquiries  on  the  finer  points  of  their  usage. \\n\\nThe  second  volume,  The  Two  Towers,  was  published  in \\nEngland  on  11  November  1954  and  in  the  United  States  on \\n21  April  1955.  Meanwhile  Tolkien  worked  to  keep  a  promise \\nhe  had  made  in  the  foreword  to  volume  one:  that  ‘an  index \\nof  names  and  strange  words’  would  appear  in  the  third  vol¬ \\nume.  As  originally  planned,  this  index  would  contain  much \\netymological  information  on  the  languages,  particularly  on \\nthe  elven  tongues,  with  a  large  vocabulary.  It  proved  the  chief \\n\\n\\nXll \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  TEXT \\n\\n\\ncause  of  the  delay  in  publishing  volume  three,  which  in  the \\nend  contained  no  index  at  all,  only  an  apology  from  the \\npublisher  for  its  absence.  For  Tolkien  had  abandoned  work \\non  it  after  indexing  volumes  one  and  two,  believing  its  size \\nand  therefore  its  cost  to  be  ruinous. \\n\\nVolume  three,  The  Return  of  the  King,  finally  appeared  in \\nEngland  on  20  October  1955  and  in  the  United  States  on \\n5  January  1956.  With  the  appearance  of  the  third  volume, \\nThe  Lord  of  the  Rings  was  published  in  its  entirety,  and  its \\nfirst  edition  text  remained  virtually  unchanged  for  a  decade. \\nTolkien  had  made  a  few  small  corrections,  but  further  errors \\nentered  The  Fellowship  of  the  Ring  in  its  December  1954 \\nsecond  impression  when  the  printer,  having  distributed  the \\ntype  after  the  first  printing,  reset  the  book  without  informing \\nthe  author  or  publisher.  These  include  misrepresentations  of \\nthe  original  printed  text  -  that  is,  words  and  phrases  that \\nread  acceptably  in  context,  but  which  depart  from  Tolkien’s \\nwording  as  originally  written  and  published. \\n\\nIn  1965,  stemming  from  what  then  appeared  to  be  copy¬ \\nright  problems  in  the  United  States,  an  American  paperback \\nfirm  published  an  unauthorized  and  non-royalty-paying  edi¬ \\ntion  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings.  For  this  new  edition  by  Ace \\nBooks  the  text  of  the  narrative  was  reset,  thus  introducing \\nnew  typographical  errors;  the  appendices,  however,  were \\nreproduced  photographically  from  the  hardcover  edition,  and \\nremain  consistent  with  it. \\n\\nTolkien  set  to  work  on  his  first  revision  of  the  text  so  that \\na  newly  revised  and  authorized  edition  could  successfully \\ncompete  on  the  American  market.  This  first  revision  of  the \\ntext  was  published  in  America  in  paperback  by  Ballantine \\nBooks,  under  licence  from  Houghton  Mifflin,  in  October \\n1965.  In  addition  to  revisions  within  the  text  itself,  Tolkien \\nreplaced  his  original  foreword  with  a  new  one.  He  was  pleased \\nto  remove  the  original  foreword;  in  his  check  copy,  he \\nwrote  of  it:  ‘confusing  (as  it  does)  real  personal  matters  with \\nthe  “machinery”  of  the  Tale,  is  a  serious  mistake’.  Tolkien \\nalso  added  an  extension  to  the  prologue  and  an  index  -  not \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  TEXT \\n\\n\\nXlll \\n\\n\\nthe  detailed  index  of  names  promised  in  the  first  edition, \\nbut,  rather,  a  bald  index  with  only  names  and  page  refer¬ \\nences.  Additionally,  at  this  time  the  appendices  were  greatly \\nrevised. \\n\\nTolkien  received  his  copies  of  the  Ballantine  edition  in  late \\nJanuary  1966,  and  in  early  February  he  recorded  in  his  diary \\nthat  he  had  ‘worked  for  some  hours  on  the  Appendices  in \\nBallantine  version  &amp;  found  more  errors  than  I  at  first \\nexpected’.  Soon  after  this  he  sent  a  small  number  of  further \\nrevisions  to  Ballantine  for  the  appendices,  including  the  now \\nwell-known  addition  of  ‘Estella  Bolger’  as  wife  of  Meriadoc \\nin  the  family  trees  in  Appendix  C.  Most  of  these  revisions, \\nwhich  entered  variously  in  the  third  and  fourth  impressions \\n(June  and  August  1966)  of  volume  three,  and  which  were \\nnot  always  inserted  correctly  (thereby  causing  further  con¬ \\nfusion  in  the  text),  somehow  never  made  it  into  the  main \\nsequence  of  revision  in  the  three-volume  British  hardcover \\nedition,  and  for  long  remained  anomalies.  Tolkien  once \\nwrote,  concerning  the  revising  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings ,  that \\nperhaps  he  had  failed  to  keep  his  notes  in  order;  this  errant \\nbranch  of  revision  seems  likely  to  be  an  example  of  that \\ndisorder  -  either  in  his  notes  or  in  the  ability  of  his  publishers \\nto  follow  them  with  utmost  accuracy. \\n\\nThe  revised  text  first  appeared  in  Great  Britain  in  a  three- \\nvolume  hardcover  ‘Second  Edition’  from  Allen  &amp;  Unwin  on \\n27  October  1966.  But  again  there  were  problems.  Although \\nthe  revisions  Tolkien  sent  to  America  of  the  text  itself  were \\navailable  to  be  utilized  in  the  new  British  edition,  his  extensive \\nrevisions  to  the  appendices  were  lost  after  being  entered  into \\nthe  Ballantine  edition.  Allen  &amp;  Unwin  were  forced  to  reset  the \\nappendices  using  the  copy  as  published  in  the  first  Ballantine \\nedition.  This  did  not  include  Tolkien’s  second,  small  set  of \\nrevisions  sent  to  Ballantine;  but,  more  significantly,  it  did \\ninclude  a  great  number  of  errors  and  omissions,  many  of \\nwhich  were  not  discovered  until  long  afterwards.  Thus,  in \\nthe  appendices,  a  close  scrutiny  of  the  first  edition  text  and \\nof  the  much  later  corrected  impressions  of  the  second  edition \\n\\n\\nXIV \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  TEXT \\n\\n\\nis  necessary  to  discern  whether  any  particular  change  in  this \\nedition  is  authorial  or  erroneous. \\n\\nIn  America,  the  revised  text  appeared  in  hardcover  in  the \\nthree-volume  edition  published  by  Houghton  Mifflin  on \\n27  February  1967.  This  text  was  evidently  photo-offset  from \\nthe  1966  Allen  &amp;  Unwin  three-volume  hardcover,  and  is  thus \\nconsistent  with  it.  Aside  from  the  first  printing  of  this  second \\nHoughton  Mifflin  edition,  which  has  a  1967  date  on  the  title \\npage,  none  of  the  many  reprintings  is  dated.  After  the  initial \\nprintings  of  this  edition,  which  bore  a  1966  copyright  notice, \\nthe  date  of  copyright  was  changed  in  1965  to  match  the \\nstatement  in  the  Ballantine  edition.  This  change  has  caused \\na  great  deal  of  confusion  for  librarians  and  other  researchers \\nwho  have  tried  to  sort  out  the  sequence  of  publication  of \\nthese  editions. \\n\\nMeanwhile,  Tolkien  spent  much  of  the  summer  of  1966 \\nfurther  revising  the  text.  In  June  he  learned  that  any  more \\nrevisions  were  too  late  for  inclusion  in  the  1966  Allen  &amp; \\nUnwin  second  edition,  and  he  recorded  in  his  diary:  ‘But  I \\nam  attempting  to  complete  my  work  [on  the  revisions]  -  I \\ncannot  leave  it  while  it  is  all  in  my  mind.  So  much  time  has \\nbeen  wasted  in  all  my  work  by  this  constant  breaking  of \\nthreads.’  This  was  the  last  major  set  of  revisions  Tolkien \\nhimself  made  to  the  text  during  his  lifetime.  They  were  added \\nto  the  second  impression  (1967)  of  the  three-volume  hard¬ \\ncover  Allen  &amp;  Unwin  second  edition.  The  revisions  them¬ \\nselves  mostly  include  corrections  of  nomenclature  and \\nattempts  at  consistency  of  usage  throughout  the  three  vol¬ \\numes.  Some  small  alterations  were  made  by  Tolkien  in  the \\n1969  one-volume  India  paper  edition. \\n\\nJ.R.R.  Tolkien  died  in  1973.  His  third  son  and  literary \\nexecutor,  Christopher  Tolkien,  sent  a  large  number  of  further \\ncorrections  of  misprints,  mainly  in  the  appendices  and  index, \\nto  Allen  &amp;  Unwin  for  use  in  their  editions  in  1974.  Most  of \\nthese  corrections  were  typographical,  and  in  line  with  his \\nfather’s  expressed  intent  in  his  own  check  copies. \\n\\nSince  1974,  Christopher  Tolkien  has  sent  additional  cor- \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  TEXT \\n\\n\\nXV \\n\\n\\nrections,  as  errors  have  been  discovered,  to  the  British  pub¬ \\nlishers  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings  (Allen  &amp;  Unwin,  later  Unwin \\nHyman,  and  now  HarperCollins),  who  have  tried  to  be  con¬ \\nscientious  in  the  impossible  task  of  maintaining  a  textual \\nintegrity  in  whichever  editions  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings  they \\nhave  published.  However,  every  time  the  text  has  been  reset \\nfor  publication  in  a  new  format  (e.g.  the  various  paperback \\neditions  published  in  England  in  the  1970s  and  1980s),  huge \\nnumbers  of  new  misprints  have  crept  in,  though  at  times \\nsome  of  these  errors  have  been  observed  and  corrected  in \\nlater  printings.  Still,  throughout  these  years  the  three-volume \\nBritish  hardcover  edition  has  retained  the  highest  textual \\nintegrity. \\n\\nIn  the  United  States,  the  text  of  the  Ballantine  paperback \\nhas  remained  unchanged  for  more  than  three  decades  after \\nTolkien  added  his  few  revisions  in  1966.  The  text  in  all  of \\nthe  Houghton  Mifflin  editions  remained  unchanged  from \\n1967  until  1987,  when  Houghton  Mifflin  photo-offset  the \\nthen  current  three-volume  British  hardcover  edition  in  order \\nto  update  the  text  used  in  their  editions.  In  those  new \\nreprintings  a  number  of  further  corrections  (overseen  by \\nChristopher  Tolkien)  were  added,  and  the  errant  Ballantine \\nbranch  of  revision  (including  the  ‘Estella  Bolger’  addition) \\nwas  integrated  into  the  main  branch  of  textual  descent.  This \\nmethod  of  correction  involved  a  cut-and-paste  process  with \\nprinted  versions  of  the  text.  Beginning  with  the  1987  Hough¬ \\nton  Mifflin  edition,  an  earlier  version  of  this  ‘Note  on  the \\nText’  (dated  October  1986)  was  added  to  The  Lord  of  the \\nRings.  This  ‘Note’  has  been  reworked  three  times  since  then \\n-  the  version  dated  April  1993  first  appeared  in  1994,  and \\nthe  version  dated  April  2002  came  out  later  that  year.  The \\npresent  ‘Note’  replaces  and  supersedes  all  previous  versions. \\n\\nFor  the  1994  British  edition  published  by  HarperCollins, \\nthe  text  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings  was  entered  into  word¬ \\nprocessing  files.  This  next  stage  of  textual  evolution  came \\nabout  to  allow  for  a  greater  uniformity  of  the  text  in  all  future \\neditions,  but  with  it,  inevitably,  came  new  wrinkles.  Some \\n\\n\\nXVI \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  TEXT \\n\\n\\nnew  misreadings  entered  into  the  text,  while  at  the  same  time \\nothers  were  fixed.  In  the  worst  instance,  one  line  of  the  ring \\ninscription  in  the  chapter  ‘The  Shadow  of  the  Past’  of  The \\nFellowship  of  the  Ring  was  simply  dropped.  Unforeseeable \\nglitches  arose  in  other  editions  when  the  base  computerized \\ntext  was  transferred  into  page-making  or  typesetting  pro¬ \\ngrams  -  e.g.,  in  one  edition  of  The  Fellowship  of  the  Ring ,  the \\nclosing  two  sentences  of  ‘The  Council  of  Elrond’  simply  and \\ninexplicably  disappeared.  Such  glitches  have  been  very  much \\nthe  exception,  not  the  rule,  and  the  text  has  otherwise  main¬ \\ntained  a  consistency  and  integrity  throughout  its  com¬ \\nputerized  evolution. \\n\\nThe  1 994  edition  also  contained  a  number  of  new  correc¬ \\ntions  (again  supervised  by  Christopher  Tolkien),  as  well  as  a \\nreconfigured  index  of  names  and  page  references.  The  1994 \\ntext  was  first  used  in  American  editions  published  by  Hough¬ \\nton  Mifflin  in  1999.  A  small  number  of  further  corrections \\nwere  added  into  the  2002  three-volume  edition  illustrated  by \\nAlan  Lee,  published  by  HarperCollins  in  Great  Britain  and \\nHoughton  Mifflin  in  the  United  States. \\n\\nThe  textual  history  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings,  merely  in  its \\npublished  form,  is  a  vast  and  complex  web.  In  this  brief \\nnote  I  have  given  only  a  glimpse  of  the  overall  sequence  and \\nstructure.  Further  details  on  the  revisions  and  corrections \\nmade  over  the  years  to  the  published  text  of  The  Lord  of  the \\nRings,  and  a  fuller  account  of  its  publishing  history,  may  be \\nfound  in  J.R.R.  Tolkien:  A  Descriptive  Bibliography,  by  Wayne \\nG.  Hammond,  with  the  assistance  of  Douglas  A.  Anderson \\n(1993)- \\n\\nFor  those  interested  in  observing  the  gradual  evolving  of \\nThe  Lord  of  the  Rings  from  its  earliest  drafts  to  its  published \\nform,  I  highly  recommend  Christopher  Tolkien’s  account, \\nwhich  appears  within  five  volumes  of  his  twelve-volume  series \\nThe  History  of  Middle-earth.  Volumes  six  through  nine  con¬ \\ntain  the  major  part  of  his  study  pertaining  to  The  Lord  of  the \\nRings\\'.  The  Return  of  the  Shadow  (1988);  The  Treason  of \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  TEXT \\n\\n\\nXVII \\n\\n\\nIsengard  (1989);  The  War  of  the  Ring  (1990);  and  Sauron \\nDefeated  (1992).  Also,  the  final  book  of  the  series,  The  Peoples \\nof  Middle-earth  (1996),  covers  the  evolution  of  the  prologue \\nand  appendices  to  The  Lord  of  the  Rings.  These  volumes \\ncontain  an  engrossing  over-the-shoulder  account  of  the \\ngrowth  and  writing  of  Tolkien’s  masterpiece. \\n\\nThe  process  of  studying  Tolkien’s  manuscripts  of  The  Lord \\nof  the  Rings  involved  the  deciphering  of  versions  where \\nTolkien  wrote  first  in  pencil  and  then  in  ink  atop  the  pencilled \\ndraft.  Christopher  Tolkien  has  decribed  his  father’s  method \\nof  composition  in  The  Return  of  the  Shadow.  ‘In  the  handwrit¬ \\ning  that  he  used  for  rapid  drafts  and  sketches,  not  intended \\nto  endure  long  before  he  turned  to  them  again  and  gave  them \\na  more  workable  form,  letters  are  so  loosely  formed  that  a \\nword  which  cannot  be  deduced  or  guessed  at  from  the  con¬ \\ntext  or  from  later  versions  can  prove  perfectly  opaque  after \\nlong  examination;  and  if,  as  he  often  did,  he  used  a  soft  pencil \\nmuch  has  now  become  blurred  and  faint.’  The  true  difficulty \\nof  reading  such  double-drafts  can  be  observed  in  the  frontis¬ \\npiece  to  The  War  of  the  Ring,  which  reproduces  in  colour \\nTolkien’s  illustration  of  ‘Shelob’s  Lair’  from  a  page  of \\nTolkien’s  manuscript.  Looking  very  closely  at  the  hasty  ink \\ndraft  alongside  the  illustration,  one  can  see  underneath  it  the \\nearlier,  hastier,  pencilled  draft.  Also  in  The  War  of  the  Ring, \\nChristopher  Tolkien  reproduces  a  page  from  the  first  manu¬ \\nscript  of  the  chapter  ‘The  Taming  of  Smeagol’,  and  the \\nprinted  text  corresponding  to  this  text  is  on  the  facing  page \\n(see  pp.  90-91).  One  is  astonished  at  anyone’s  ability  to \\ndecipher  such  texts. \\n\\nThat  difficulty  aside,  just  what  do  these  books  signify  to \\nordinary  readers  and  to  Tolkien  scholars?  And  what  is  ‘the \\nhistory  of  the  writing’  of  a  book?  Simply,  these  volumes  show \\nin  great  detail  the  development  of  the  story  of  The  Lord  of \\nthe  Rings  from  its  very  earliest  drafts  and  hasty  projections \\nthrough  its  completion.  We  see  in  the  earliest  materials  what \\nis  very  much  a  children’s  book,  a  sequel  to  The  Hobbit,  and \\nas  the  story  grows  through  various  ‘phases’,  there  is  an \\n\\n\\nXV111 \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  TEXT \\n\\n\\nincrease  in  seriousness  and  depth.  We  see  alternate  branches \\nof  development,  the  gradual  blending  and  merging  of  certain \\ncharacters,  and  the  slow  emergence  of  the  nature  of  the  rings \\nand  of  the  motivations  of  other  characters.  Some  of  these \\nvarious  ideas  are  abandoned  altogether,  while  others  are \\nreworked  into  some  variant  form  that  may  or  may  not  survive \\ninto  the  final  version. \\n\\nOne  could  make  a  whole  catalogue  of  interesting  tidbits \\nfrom  Christopher  Tolkien’s  study  -  such  as  the  fact  that \\nStrider  was  called  Trotter  until  a  very  late  stage  in  the  writing \\nof  the  book;  that  Trotter  was  at  one  time  a  hobbit,  so  named \\nbecause  he  wore  wooden  shoes;  that  Tolkien  at  one  point \\nconsidered  a  romance  between  Aragorn  and  Eowyn;  that \\nTolkien  wrote  an  epilogue  to  the  book,  tying  up  loose  ends, \\nbut  it  was  dropped  before  publication  (and  now  appears  in \\nSanron  Defeated)-,  and  so  on.  But  these  developments  are  best \\nappreciated  when  read  within  the  context  of  Christopher \\nTolkien’s  commentary  rather  than  discussed  separately. \\n\\nThe  most  significant  achievement  of  these  volumes  is  that \\nthey  show  us  how  Tolkien  wrote  and  thought.  Nowhere  else \\ndo  we  see  the  authorial  process  itself  at  work  in  such  detail. \\nTolkien’s  hastiest  comments  about  where  the  story  might \\nproceed,  or  why  it  can  or  can’t  go  such  and  such  a  way  - \\nthese  queries  to  himself  were  written  out:  Tolkien  is  literally \\nthinking  on  paper.  This  gives  an  added  dimension  of  under¬ \\nstanding  to  Tolkien’s  comment  to  Stanley  Unwin  in  a  1963 \\nletter  that,  when  suffering  from  trouble  with  his  shoulder  and \\nright  arm,  ‘I  found  not  being  able  to  use  a  pen  or  pencil  as \\ndefeating  as  the  loss  of  her  beak  would  be  to  a  hen.’  And  we, \\nas  readers  of  these  volumes,  can  share  with  Tolkien  himself \\nthe  wonder  and  bewilderment  of  new  characters  appearing \\nas  if  from  nowhere,  or  of  some  other  sudden  change  or  devel¬ \\nopment,  at  the  very  moment  of  their  emergence  into  the \\nstory. \\n\\nI  know  of  no  other  instance  in  literature  where  we  have \\nsuch  a  ‘history  of  the  writing’  of  a  book,  told  mostly  by  the \\nauthor  himself,  with  all  the  hesitations  and  false  paths  laid \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  TEXT \\n\\n\\nXIX \\n\\n\\nout  before  us,  sorted  out,  commented  upon,  and  served  up \\nto  a  reader  like  a  feast.  We  are  shown  innumerable  instances \\nin  the  minutest  detail  of  the  thought-process  itself  at  work. \\nWe  see  the  author  fully  absorbed  in  creation  for  its  own  sake. \\nAnd  this  is  all  the  more  exceptional  because  this  is  a  history \\nnot  only  of  the  unfolding  of  a  story  and  its  text,  but  of  the \\nevolution  of  a  world.  There  is  an  additional  wealth  of  material \\nbeyond  simple  narrative  text.  There  are  maps  and  illustra¬ \\ntions.  There  are  languages  and  writing  systems,  and  the  his¬ \\ntories  of  the  peoples  who  spoke  and  wrote  in  these  systems. \\nAll  of  these  additional  materials  add  multiple  dimensions  of \\ncomplexity  to  our  appreciation  of  the  invented  world  itself. \\n\\nFifty  years  into  the  published  life  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings, \\nit  seems  extraordinary  to  me  that  we  have  not  only  such  a \\nmasterful  work  of  literature  but  also  as  a  companion  to  it  an \\nunparalleled  account  of  its  writing.  Our  gratitude  as  readers \\ngoes  to  both  of  the  Tolkiens,  father  and  son. \\n\\nDouglas  A.  Anderson \\nMay  2004 \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  50™  ANNIVERSARY \\nEDITION \\n\\n\\nIn  this  edition  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings,  prepared  for  the \\nfiftieth  anniversary  of  its  publication,  between  three  and  four \\nhundred  emendations  have  been  made  following  an  exhaus¬ \\ntive  review  of  past  editions  and  printings.  The  present  text \\nis  based  on  the  setting  of  the  HarperCollins  three-volume \\nhardcover  edition  of  2002,  which  in  turn  was  a  revision  of  the \\nHarperCollins  reset  edition  of  1994.  As  Douglas  A.  Anderson \\ncomments  in  the  preceding  ‘Note  on  the  Text’,  each  of  those \\neditions  was  itself  corrected,  and  each  also  introduced  new \\nerrors.  At  the  same  time,  other  errors  survived  undetected, \\namong  them  some  five  dozen  which  entered  as  long  ago  as \\n1954,  in  the  resetting  of  The  Fellowship  of  the  Ring  published \\nas  its  ‘second  impression’. \\n\\nThat  the  printer  had  quietly  reset  The  Fellowship  of  the \\nRing,  and  that  copies  had  been  issued  without  proof  having \\nbeen  read  by  the  author,  never  became  known  to  Tolkien; \\nwhile  his  publisher,  Rayner  Unwin,  learned  of  it  only  thirty- \\neight  years  after  the  fact.  Tolkien  found  a  few  of  the  unautho¬ \\nrized  changes  introduced  in  the  second  printing  when \\n(probably  while  preparing  the  second  edition  in  1965)  he \\nread  a  copy  of  the  twelfth  impression  (1962),  but  thought \\nthe  errors  newly  made.  These,  among  others,  were  corrected \\nin  the  course  of  the  reprinting.  Then  in  1992  Eric  Thompson, \\na  reader  with  a  keen  eye  for  typographic  detail,  noticed  small \\ndifferences  between  the  first  and  second  impressions  of  The \\nFellowship  of  the  Ring  and  called  them  to  the  attention  of  the \\npresent  editors.  About  one-sixth  of  the  errors  that  entered  in \\nthe  second  printing  quickly  came  to  light.  Many  more  were \\nrevealed  only  recently,  when  Steven  M.  Frisby  used  ingenious \\noptical  aids  to  make  a  comparison  of  copies  of  The  Lord  of \\nthe  Rings  in  greater  detail  than  was  previously  accomplished. \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  50th  ANNIVERSARY  EDITION \\n\\n\\nXXI \\n\\n\\nWe  have  gladly  made  full  use  of  Mr  Frisby’s  results,  which \\nhe  has  generously  shared  and  discussed. \\n\\nIn  the  course  of  its  fifty-year  history  The  Lord  of  the  Rings \\nhas  had  many  such  readers  who  have  recorded  changes  made \\nbetween  its  various  appearances  in  print,  both  to  document \\nwhat  has  gone  before  and  to  aid  in  the  achievement  of  an \\nauthoritative  text.  Errors  or  possible  errors  were  reported  to \\nthe  author  himself  or  to  his  publishers,  and  information  on \\nthe  textual  history  of  the  work  circulated  among  Tolkien \\nenthusiasts  at  least  as  early  as  1966,  when  Banks  Mebane \\npublished  his  ‘Prolegomena  to  a  Variorum  Tolkien’  in  the \\nfanzine  Entmoot.  Most  notably  in  later  years,  Douglas  A. \\nAnderson  has  been  in  the  forefront  of  efforts  to  achieve  an \\naccurate  text  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings  (and  of  The  Hobbit); \\nChristina  Scull  has  published  ‘A  Preliminary  Study  of  Vari¬ \\nations  in  Editions  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings’  in  Beyond  Bree \\n(April  and  August  1985);  Wayne  G.  Hammond  has  compiled \\nextensive  lists  of  textual  changes  in  J.R.R.  Tolkien:  A  Descrip¬ \\ntive  Bibliography  (1993);  and  David  Bratman  has  published \\nan  important  article,  ‘A  Corrigenda  to  The  Lord  of  the  Rings’, \\nin  the  March  1994  number  of  The  Tolkien  Collector.  The \\nobservations  of  Dainis  Bisenieks,  Yuval  Welis,  Charles  Noad, \\nand  other  readers,  sent  to  us  directly  or  posted  in  public \\nforums,  have  also  been  of  service. \\n\\nEfforts  such  as  these  follow  the  example  of  the  author  of \\nThe  Lord  of  the  Rings  during  his  lifetime.  His  concern  for  the \\ntextual  accuracy  and  coherence  of  his  work  is  evident  from \\nthe  many  emendations  he  made  in  later  printings,  and  from \\nnotes  he  made  for  other  emendations  which  for  one  reason \\nor  another  have  not  previously  (or  have  only  partly)  been  put \\ninto  effect.  Even  late  in  life,  when  such  labours  wearied  him, \\nhis  feelings  were  clear.  On  30  October  1967  he  wrote  to  Joy \\nHill  at  George  Allen  &amp;  Unwin,  concerning  a  reader’s  query \\nhe  had  received  about  points  in  the  Appendices  to  The  Lord \\nof  the  Rings :  ‘Personally  I  have  ceased  to  bother  about  these \\nminor  “discrepancies”,  since  if  the  genealogies  and  calendars \\netc.  lack  verisimilitude  it  is  in  their  general  excessive  accuracy: \\n\\n\\nXXU  NOTE  ON  THE  50th  ANNIVERSARY  EDITION \\n\\n\\nas  compared  with  real  annals  or  genealogies!  Anyway  the \\nslips  were  few,  have  now  mostly  been  removed,  and  the  dis¬ \\ncovery  of  what  remain  seems  an  amusing  pastime!  But  errors \\nin  the  text  are  another  matter\\'  (italics  ours).  In  fact  Tolkien \\nhad  not  ‘ceased  to  bother’,  and  ‘slips’  were  dealt  with  as \\nopportunities  arose.  These,  and  the  indulgence  of  his  pub¬ \\nlisher,  allowed  Tolkien  a  luxury  few  authors  enjoy:  multiple \\nchances  not  only  to  correct  his  text  but  to  improve  it,  and  to \\nfurther  develop  the  languages,  geography,  and  peoples  of \\nMiddle-earth. \\n\\nThe  fiftieth  anniversary  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings  seemed  an \\nideal  opportunity  to  consider  the  latest  (2002)  text  in  light  of \\ninformation  we  had  gathered  in  the  course  of  decades  of  work \\nin  Tolkien  studies,  with  Steve  Frisby’s  research  at  hand,  and \\nwith  an  electronic  copy  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings  (supplied  by \\nHarperCollins)  searchable  by  keyword  or  phrase.  The  latter \\nespecially  allowed  us  to  develop  lists  of  words  that  varied \\nfrom  one  instance  to  another,  and  investigate  variations  in \\nusage,  as  they  stood  in  the  copy-text  and  relative  to  earlier \\neditions  and  printings.  Of  course  Tolkien  wrote  The  Lord  of \\nthe  Rings  over  so  long  a  period  of  time,  some  eighteen  years, \\nthat  inconsistencies  in  its  text  were  almost  inevitable.  Chris¬ \\ntopher  Tolkien  even  observed  to  us  that  some  apparent \\ninconsistencies  of  form  in  his  father’s  work  may  even  have \\nbeen  deliberate:  for  instance,  although  Tolkien  carefully  dis¬ \\ntinguished  house  ‘dwelling’  from  House  ‘noble  family  or  dyn¬ \\nasty’,  in  two  instances  he  used  house  in  the  latter  sense  but \\nin  lower  case,  perhaps  because  a  capital  letter  would  have \\ndetracted  from  the  importance  of  the  adjective  with  which \\nthe  word  was  paired  (‘royal  house’,  ‘golden  house’).  There \\ncan  be  no  doubt,  however,  that  Tolkien  attempted  to  correct \\ninconsistency,  no  less  than  outright  error,  whenever  it  came \\nto  his  attention,  and  it  was  our  opinion,  with  the  advice  and \\nagreement  of  Christopher  Tolkien,  that  an  attempt  should  be \\nmade  to  do  so  in  the  anniversary  edition,  in  so  far  as  we  could \\ncarefully  and  conservatively  distinguish  what  to  emend. \\n\\nMany  of  the  emendations  in  the  present  text  are  to  marks \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  50th  ANNIVERSARY  EDITION  XXU1 \\n\\n\\nof  punctuation,  either  to  correct  recent  typographical  errors \\nor  to  repair  surviving  alterations  introduced  in  the  second \\nprinting  of  The  Fellowship  of  the  Ring.  In  the  latter  respect \\nand  in  every  case,  Tolkien’s  original  punctuation  is  always \\nmore  felicitous  -  subtle  points,  when  one  is  comparing  com¬ \\nmas  and  semi-colons,  but  no  less  a  part  of  the  author’s \\nintended  expression.  Distinctive  words  such  as  chill  rather \\nthan  cold ,  and  glistered  rather  than  glistened ,  changed  by  type¬ \\nsetters  long  ago  without  authorization,  likewise  have  been \\nrestored.  A  controlled  amount  of  regularization  also  seemed \\ncalled  for,  such  as  naught  rather  than  nought ,  a  change  insti¬ \\ntuted  by  Tolkien  but  not  carried  through  in  all  instances; \\nDark  Power  rather  than  dark  power  when  the  reference  is \\nobviously  to  Sauron  (or  Movgoth)\\',  Barrow-downs  by  Tolkien’s \\npreference  rather  than  Barrowdowns;  likewise  Bree-hill  rather \\nthan  Bree  Hill ;  accented  and  more  common  Driiadan  rather \\nthan  Druadan;  capitalized  names  of  seasons  when  used  as \\npersonification  or  metaphor,  according  to  Tolkien’s  predomi¬ \\nnant  practice  and  the  internal  logic  of  the  text;  and  Elvish \\nrather  than  elvish  when  used  as  a  separate  adjective,  following \\na  preference  Tolkien  marked  in  his  copy  of  the  second  edition \\nof  The  Lord  of  the  Rings.  In  addition,  we  have  added  a  second \\naccent  to  Numendrean(s),  as  Tolkien  often  wrote  the  name  in \\nmanuscript  and  as  it  appears  in  The  Silmarillion  and  other \\nposthumous  publications. \\n\\nThe  result,  nonetheless,  still  includes  many  variations  in \\ncapitalization,  punctuation,  and  other  points  of  style.  Not  all \\nof  these  are  erroneous:  they  include  words  such  as  Sun,  Moon, \\nHobbit,  and  Man  (or  sun,  moon,  hobbit,  man),  which  may \\nchange  form  according  to  meaning  or  application,  in  relation \\nto  adjacent  adjectives,  or  whether  Tolkien  intended  personi¬ \\nfication,  poetry,  or  emphasis.  His  intent  cannot  be  divined \\nwith  confidence  in  every  case.  But  it  is  possible  to  discern \\nTolkien’s  preferences  in  many  instances,  from  statements  he \\nwrote  in  his  check  copies  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings  or  from  a \\nclose  analysis  of  its  text  in  manuscript,  typescript,  proof,  and \\nprint.  Whenever  there  has  been  any  doubt  whatsoever  as  to \\n\\n\\nxxiv  NOTE  ON  THE  50th  ANNIVERSARY  EDITION \\n\\nthe  author’s  intentions,  the  text  has  been  allowed  to  stand. \\n\\nMost  of  the  demonstrable  errors  noted  by  Christopher \\nTolkien  in  The  History  of  Middle-earth  also  have  been  cor¬ \\nrected,  such  as  the  distance  from  the  Brandywine  Bridge  to \\nthe  Ferry  ( ten  miles  rather  than  twenty)  and  the  number  of \\nMerry’s  ponies  (five  rather  than  six),  shadows  of  earlier \\ndrafts.  But  those  inconsistencies  of  content,  such  as  Gimli’s \\nfamous  (and  erroneous)  statement  in  Book  III,  Chapter  7, \\n‘Till  now  I  have  hewn  naught  but  wood  since  I  left  Moria’, \\nwhich  would  require  rewriting  to  emend  rather  than  simple \\ncorrection,  remain  unchanged. \\n\\nSo  many  new  emendations  to  The  Lord  of  the  Rings,  and \\nsuch  an  extensive  review  of  its  text,  deserve  to  be  fully  docu¬ \\nmented.  Although  most  readers  will  be  content  with  the  text \\nalone,  many  will  want  to  know  more  about  the  problems \\nencountered  in  preparing  this  new  edition,  and  their  solutions \\n(where  solutions  have  been  possible),  especially  where  the \\ntext  has  been  emended,  but  also  where  it  has  not.  To  this \\nend,  and  to  illuminate  the  work  in  other  respects,  we  are \\npreparing  a  volume  of  annotations  to  The  Lord  of  the  Rings \\nfor  publication  in  2005.  This  will  allow  us  to  discuss,  at  a \\nlength  impossible  in  a  prefatory  note,  the  various  textual \\ncruces  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings,  to  identify  changes  that  have \\nbeen  made  to  the  present  text,  and  to  remark  on  significant \\nalterations  to  the  published  work  throughout  its  history.  We \\nwill  also  explain  archaic  or  unusual  words  and  names  in  The \\nLord  of  the  Rings,  explore  literary  and  historical  influences, \\nnote  connections  with  Tolkien’s  other  writings,  and  comment \\non  differences  between  its  drafts  and  published  form,  on \\nquestions  of  language,  and  on  much  else  that  we  hope  will \\ninterest  readers  and  enhance  their  enjoyment  of  Tolkien’s \\nmasterpiece. \\n\\n\\nWayne  G.  Hammond  &amp;  Christina  Scull \\n\\nMay  2004 \\n\\n\\nFOREWORD  TO  THE  SECOND  EDITION \\n\\n\\nThis  tale  grew  in  the  telling,  until  it  became  a  history  of  the \\nGreat  War  of  the  Ring  and  included  many  glimpses  of  the \\nyet  more  ancient  history  that  preceded  it.  It  was  begun  soon \\nafter  The  Hobbit  was  written  and  before  its  publication  in \\n1 937;  but  I  did  not  go  on  with  this  sequel,  for  I  wished  first \\nto  complete  and  set  in  order  the  mythology  and  legends  of \\nthe  Elder  Days,  which  had  then  been  taking  shape  for  some \\nyears.  I  desired  to  do  this  for  my  own  satisfaction,  and  I  had \\nlittle  hope  that  other  people  would  be  interested  in  this  work, \\nespecially  since  it  was  primarily  linguistic  in  inspiration  and \\nwas  begun  in  order  to  provide  the  necessary  background  of \\n‘history’  for  Elvish  tongues. \\n\\nWhen  those  whose  advice  and  opinion  I  sought  corrected \\nlittle  hope  to  no  hope ,  I  went  back  to  the  sequel,  encouraged \\nby  requests  from  readers  for  more  information  concerning \\nhobbits  and  their  adventures.  But  the  story  was  drawn  irre¬ \\nsistibly  towards  the  older  world,  and  became  an  account,  as \\nit  were,  of  its  end  and  passing  away  before  its  beginning  and \\nmiddle  had  been  told.  The  process  had  begun  in  the  writing \\nof  The  Hobbit ,  in  which  there  were  already  some  references \\nto  the  older  matter:  Elrond,  Gondolin,  the  High-elves,  and \\nthe  ores,  as  well  as  glimpses  that  had  arisen  unbidden  of \\nthings  higher  or  deeper  or  darker  than  its  surface:  Durin, \\nMoria,  Gandalf,  the  Necromancer,  the  Ring.  The  discovery \\nof  the  significance  of  these  glimpses  and  of  their  relation  to \\nthe  ancient  histories  revealed  the  Third  Age  and  its  culmi¬ \\nnation  in  the  War  of  the  Ring. \\n\\nThose  who  had  asked  for  more  information  about  hobbits \\neventually  got  it,  but  they  had  to  wait  a  long  time;  for  the \\ncomposition  of  The  Lord  of  the  Rings  went  on  at  intervals \\nduring  the  years  1936  to  1949,  a  period  in  which  I  had  many \\nduties  that  I  did  not  neglect,  and  many  other  interests  as  a \\nlearner  and  teacher  that  often  absorbed  me.  The  delay  was, \\n\\n\\nXXVI \\n\\n\\nFOREWORD  TO  THE  SECOND  EDITION \\n\\n\\nof  course,  also  increased  by  the  outbreak  of  war  in  1939,  by \\nthe  end  of  which  year  the  tale  had  not  yet  reached  the  end  of \\nBook  One.  In  spite  of  the  darkness  of  the  next  five  years  I \\nfound  that  the  story  could  not  now  be  wholly  abandoned, \\nand  I  plodded  on,  mostly  by  night,  till  I  stood  by  Balin’s  tomb \\nin  Moria.  There  I  halted  for  a  long  while.  It  was  almost  a \\nyear  later  when  I  went  on  and  so  came  to  Lothlorien  and  the \\nGreat  River  late  in  1941.  In  the  next  year  I  wrote  the  first \\ndrafts  of  the  matter  that  now  stands  as  Book  Three,  and  the \\nbeginnings  of  chapters  I  and  III  of  Book  Five;  and  there  as \\nthe  beacons  flared  in  Anorien  and  Theoden  came  to  Harrow- \\ndale  I  stopped.  Foresight  had  failed  and  there  was  no  time \\nfor  thought. \\n\\nIt  was  during  1 944  that,  leaving  the  loose  ends  and  perplex¬ \\nities  of  a  war  which  it  was  my  task  to  conduct,  or  at  least  to \\nreport,  I  forced  myself  to  tackle  the  journey  of  Frodo  to \\nMordor.  These  chapters,  eventually  to  become  Book  Four, \\nwere  written  and  sent  out  as  a  serial  to  my  son,  Christopher, \\nthen  in  South  Africa  with  the  RAF.  Nonetheless  it  took \\nanother  five  years  before  the  tale  was  brought  to  its  present \\nend;  in  that  time  I  changed  my  house,  my  chair,  and  my \\ncollege,  and  the  days  though  less  dark  were  no  less  laborious. \\nThen  when  the  ‘end’  had  at  last  been  reached  the  whole  story \\nhad  to  be  revised,  and  indeed  largely  re-written  backwards. \\nAnd  it  had  to  be  typed,  and  re-typed:  by  me;  the  cost  of \\nprofessional  typing  by  the  ten-fingered  was  beyond  my \\nmeans. \\n\\nThe  Lord  of  the  Rings  has  been  read  by  many  people  since \\nit  finally  appeared  in  print;  and  I  should  like  to  say  something \\nhere  with  reference  to  the  many  opinions  or  guesses  that  I \\nhave  received  or  have  read  concerning  the  motives  and  mean¬ \\ning  of  the  tale.  The  prime  motive  was  the  desire  of  a  tale-teller \\nto  try  his  hand  at  a  really  long  story  that  would  hold  the \\nattention  of  readers,  amuse  them,  delight  them,  and  at  times \\nmaybe  excite  them  or  deeply  move  them.  As  a  guide  I  had \\nonly  my  own  feelings  for  what  is  appealing  or  moving,  and \\nfor  many  the  guide  was  inevitably  often  at  fault.  Some  who \\n\\n\\nFOREWORD  TO  THE  SECOND  EDITION \\n\\n\\nXXV11 \\n\\n\\nhave  read  the  book,  or  at  any  rate  have  reviewed  it,  have \\nfound  it  boring,  absurd,  or  contemptible;  and  I  have  no  cause \\nto  complain,  since  I  have  similar  opinions  of  their  works,  or \\nof  the  lands  of  writing  that  they  evidently  prefer.  But  even \\nfrom  the  points  of  view  of  many  who  have  enjoyed  my  story \\nthere  is  much  that  fails  to  please.  It  is  perhaps  not  possible \\nin  a  long  tale  to  please  everybody  at  all  points,  nor  to  displease \\neverybody  at  the  same  points;  for  I  find  from  the  letters  that \\nI  have  received  that  the  passages  or  chapters  that  are  to  some \\na  blemish  are  all  by  others  specially  approved.  The  most \\ncritical  reader  of  all,  myself,  now  finds  many  defects,  minor \\nand  major,  but  being  fortunately  under  no  obligation  either \\nto  review  the  book  or  to  write  it  again,  he  will  pass  over  these \\nin  silence,  except  one  that  has  been  noted  by  others:  the  book \\nis  too  short. \\n\\nAs  for  any  inner  meaning  or  ‘message’,  it  has  in  the  inten¬ \\ntion  of  the  author  none.  It  is  neither  allegorical  nor  topical. \\nAs  the  story  grew  it  put  down  roots  (into  the  past)  and  threw \\nout  unexpected  branches:  but  its  main  theme  was  settled \\nfrom  the  outset  by  the  inevitable  choice  of  the  Ring  as  the \\nlink  between  it  and  The  Hobbit.  The  crucial  chapter,  ‘The \\nShadow  of  the  Past’,  is  one  of  the  oldest  parts  of  the  tale.  It \\nwas  written  long  before  the  foreshadow  of  1939  had  yet \\nbecome  a  threat  of  inevitable  disaster,  and  from  that  point \\nthe  story  would  have  developed  along  essentially  the  same \\nlines,  if  that  disaster  had  been  averted.  Its  sources  are  things \\nlong  before  in  mind,  or  in  some  cases  already  written,  and \\nlittle  or  nothing  in  it  was  modified  by  the  war  that  began  in \\n1939  or  its  sequels. \\n\\nThe  real  war  does  not  resemble  the  legendary  war  in  its \\nprocess  or  its  conclusion.  If  it  had  inspired  or  directed  the \\ndevelopment  of  the  legend,  then  certainly  the  Ring  would \\nhave  been  seized  and  used  against  Sauron;  he  would  not  have \\nbeen  annihilated  but  enslaved,  and  Barad-dur  would  not  have \\nbeen  destroyed  but  occupied.  Saruman,  failing  to  get  pos¬ \\nsession  of  the  Ring,  would  in  the  confusion  and  treacheries \\nof  the  time  have  found  in  Mordor  the  missing  links  in  his \\n\\n\\nXXVUl \\n\\n\\nFOREWORD  TO  THE  SECOND  EDITION \\n\\n\\nown  researches  into  Ring-lore,  and  before  long  he  would \\nhave  made  a  Great  Ring  of  his  own  with  which  to  challenge \\nthe  self-styled  Ruler  of  Middle-earth.  In  that  conflict  both \\nsides  would  have  held  hobbits  in  hatred  and  contempt:  they \\nwould  not  long  have  survived  even  as  slaves. \\n\\nOther  arrangements  could  be  devised  according  to  the \\ntastes  or  views  of  those  who  like  allegory  or  topical  reference. \\nBut  I  cordially  dislike  allegory  in  all  its  manifestations,  and \\nalways  have  done  so  since  I  grew  old  and  wary  enough  to \\ndetect  its  presence.  I  much  prefer  history,  true  or  feigned, \\nwith  its  varied  applicability  to  the  thought  and  experience  of \\nreaders.  I  think  that  many  confuse  ‘applicability’  with  ‘alle¬ \\ngory’;  but  the  one  resides  in  the  freedom  of  the  reader,  and \\nthe  other  in  the  purposed  domination  of  the  author. \\n\\nAn  author  cannot  of  course  remain  wholly  unaffected  by \\nhis  experience,  but  the  ways  in  which  a  story-germ  uses  the \\nsoil  of  experience  are  extremely  complex,  and  attempts  to \\ndefine  the  process  are  at  best  guesses  from  evidence  that  is \\ninadequate  and  ambiguous.  It  is  also  false,  though  naturally \\nattractive,  when  the  fives  of  an  author  and  critic  have  over¬ \\nlapped,  to  suppose  that  the  movements  of  thought  or  the \\nevents  of  times  common  to  both  were  necessarily  the  most \\npowerful  influences.  One  has  indeed  personally  to  come \\nunder  the  shadow  of  war  to  feel  fully  its  oppression;  but  as \\nthe  years  go  by  it  seems  now  often  forgotten  that  to  be  caught \\nin  youth  by  1914  was  no  less  hideous  an  experience  than  to \\nbe  involved  in  1939  and  the  following  years.  By  1918  all  but \\none  of  my  close  friends  were  dead.  Or  to  take  a  less  grievous \\nmatter:  it  has  been  supposed  by  some  that  ‘The  Scouring  of \\nthe  Shire’  reflects  the  situation  in  England  at  the  time  when \\nI  was  finishing  my  tale.  It  does  not.  It  is  an  essential  part  of \\nthe  plot,  foreseen  from  the  outset,  though  in  the  event  modi¬ \\nfied  by  the  character  of  Saruman  as  developed  in  the  story \\nwithout,  need  I  say,  any  allegorical  significance  or  contem¬ \\nporary  political  reference  whatsoever.  It  has  indeed  some \\nbasis  in  experience,  though  slender  (for  the  economic  situ¬ \\nation  was  entirely  different),  and  much  further  back.  The \\n\\n\\nFOREWORD  TO  THE  SECOND  EDITION \\n\\n\\nXXIX \\n\\n\\ncountry  in  which  I  lived  in  childhood  was  being  shabbily \\ndestroyed  before  I  was  ten,  in  days  when  motor-cars  were \\nrare  objects  (I  had  never  seen  one)  and  men  were  still  building \\nsuburban  railways.  Recently  I  saw  in  a  paper  a  picture  of  the \\nlast  decrepitude  of  the  once  thriving  corn-mill  beside  its  pool \\nthat  long  ago  seemed  to  me  so  important.  I  never  liked  the \\nlooks  of  the  Young  miller,  but  his  father,  the  Old  miller,  had \\na  black  beard,  and  he  was  not  named  Sandyman. \\n\\nThe  Lord  of  the  Rings  is  now  issued  in  a  new  edition,  and \\nthe  opportunity  has  been  taken  of  revising  it.  A  number  of \\nerrors  and  inconsistencies  that  still  remained  in  the  text  have \\nbeen  corrected,  and  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  provide \\ninformation  on  a  few  points  which  attentive  readers  have \\nraised.  I  have  considered  all  their  comments  and  enquiries, \\nand  if  some  seem  to  have  been  passed  over  that  may  be \\nbecause  I  have  failed  to  keep  my  notes  in  order;  but  many \\nenquiries  could  only  be  answered  by  additional  appendices, \\nor  indeed  by  the  production  of  an  accessory  volume  contain¬ \\ning  much  of  the  material  that  I  did  not  include  in  the  original \\nedition,  in  particular  more  detailed  linguistic  information.  In \\nthe  meantime  this  edition  offers  this  Foreword,  an  addition \\nto  the  Prologue,  some  notes,  and  an  index  of  the  names  of \\npersons  and  places.  This  index  is  in  intention  complete  in \\nitems  but  not  in  references,  since  for  the  present  purpose  it \\nhas  been  necessary  to  reduce  its  built.  A  complete  index, \\nmaking  full  use  of  the  material  prepared  for  me  by  Mrs.  N. \\nSmith,  belongs  rather  to  the  accessory  volume. \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\ni \\n\\nConcerning  Hobbits \\n\\nThis  book  is  largely  concerned  with  Hobbits,  and  from  its \\npages  a  reader  may  discover  much  of  their  character  and  a \\nlittle  of  their  history.  Further  information  will  also  be  found \\nin  the  selection  from  the  Red  Book  of  Westmarch  that  has \\nalready  been  published,  under  the  title  of  The  Hobbit.  That \\nstory  was  derived  from  the  earlier  chapters  of  the  Red  Book, \\ncomposed  by  Bilbo  himself,  the  first  Hobbit  to  become \\nfamous  in  the  world  at  large,  and  called  by  him  There  and \\nBack  Again ,  since  they  told  of  his  journey  into  the  East  and \\nhis  return:  an  adventure  which  later  involved  all  the  Hobbits \\nin  the  great  events  of  that  Age  that  are  here  related. \\n\\nMany,  however,  may  wish  to  know  more  about  this  re¬ \\nmarkable  people  from  the  outset,  while  some  may  not  possess \\nthe  earlier  book.  For  such  readers  a  few  notes  on  the  more \\nimportant  points  are  here  collected  from  Hobbit-lore,  and \\nthe  first  adventure  is  briefly  recalled. \\n\\nHobbits  are  an  unobtrusive  but  very  ancient  people,  more \\nnumerous  formerly  than  they  are  today;  for  they  love  peace \\nand  quiet  and  good  tilled  earth:  a  well-ordered  and  well- \\nfarmed  countryside  was  their  favourite  haunt.  They  do  not \\nand  did  not  understand  or  like  machines  more  complicated \\nthan  a  forge-bellows,  a  water-mill,  or  a  hand-loom,  though \\nthey  were  skilful  with  tools.  Even  in  ancient  days  they \\nwere,  as  a  rule,  shy  of  ‘the  Big  Folk’,  as  they  call  us,  and \\nnow  they  avoid  us  with  dismay  and  are  becoming  hard  to \\nfind.  They  are  quick  of  hearing  and  sharp-eyed,  and  though \\nthey  are  inclined  to  be  fat  and  do  not  hurry  unnecessarily,  they \\nare  nonetheless  nimble  and  deft  in  their  movements.  They \\n\\n\\n2 \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\npossessed  from  the  first  the  art  of  disappearing  swiftly  and \\nsilently,  when  large  folk  whom  they  do  not  wish  to  meet  come \\nblundering  by;  and  this  art  they  have  developed  until  to  Men \\nit  may  seem  magical.  But  Hobbits  have  never,  in  fact,  studied \\nmagic  of  any  kind,  and  their  elusiveness  is  due  solely  to \\na  professional  skill  that  heredity  and  practice,  and  a  close \\nfriendship  with  the  earth,  have  rendered  inimitable  by  bigger \\nand  clumsier  races. \\n\\nFor  they  are  a  little  people,  smaller  than  Dwarves:  less  stout \\nand  stocky,  that  is,  even  when  they  are  not  actually  much \\nshorter.  Their  height  is  variable,  ranging  between  two  and \\nfour  feet  of  our  measure.  They  seldom  now  reach  three  feet; \\nbut  they  have  dwindled,  they  say,  and  in  ancient  days  they \\nwere  taller.  According  to  the  Red  Book,  Bandobras  Took \\n(Bullroarer),  son  of  Isumbras  the  Third,  was  four  foot  five \\nand  able  to  ride  a  horse.  He  was  surpassed  in  all  Hobbit \\nrecords  only  by  two  famous  characters  of  old;  but  that  curious \\nmatter  is  dealt  with  in  this  book. \\n\\nAs  for  the  Hobbits  of  the  Shire,  with  whom  these  tales  are \\nconcerned,  in  the  days  of  their  peace  and  prosperity  they \\nwere  a  merry  folk.  They  dressed  in  bright  colours,  being \\nnotably  fond  of  yellow  and  green;  but  they  seldom  wore \\nshoes,  since  their  feet  had  tough  leathery  soles  and  were  clad \\nin  a  thick  curling  hair,  much  like  the  hair  of  their  heads,  which \\nwas  commonly  brown.  Thus,  the  only  craft  little  practised \\namong  them  was  shoe-making;  but  they  had  long  and  skilful \\nfingers  and  could  make  many  other  useful  and  comely  things. \\nTheir  faces  were  as  a  rule  good-natured  rather  than  beau¬ \\ntiful,  broad,  bright-eyed,  red-cheeked,  with  mouths  apt  to \\nlaughter,  and  to  eating  and  drinking.  And  laugh  they  did,  and \\neat,  and  drink,  often  and  heartily,  being  fond  of  simple  jests \\nat  all  times,  and  of  six  meals  a  day  (when  they  could  get \\nthem) .  They  were  hospitable  and  delighted  in  parties,  and  in \\npresents,  which  they  gave  away  freely  and  eagerly  accepted. \\n\\nIt  is  plain  indeed  that  in  spite  of  later  estrangement  Hobbits \\nare  relatives  of  ours:  far  nearer  to  us  than  Elves,  or  even  than \\nDwarves.  Of  old  they  spoke  the  languages  of  Men,  after  their \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\n\\nown  fashion,  and  liked  and  disliked  much  the  same  things  as \\nMen  did.  But  what  exactly  our  relationship  is  can  no  longer \\nbe  discovered.  The  beginning  of  Hobbits  lies  far  back  in  the \\nElder  Days  that  are  now  lost  and  forgotten.  Only  the  Elves \\nstill  preserve  any  records  of  that  vanished  time,  and  their \\ntraditions  are  concerned  almost  entirely  with  their  own  his¬ \\ntory,  in  which  Men  appear  seldom  and  Hobbits  are  not  men¬ \\ntioned  at  all.  Yet  it  is  clear  that  Hobbits  had,  in  fact,  lived \\nquietly  in  Middle-earth  for  many  long  years  before  other  folk \\nbecame  even  aware  of  them.  And  the  world  being  after  all \\nfull  of  strange  creatures  beyond  count,  these  little  people \\nseemed  of  very  little  importance.  But  in  the  days  of  Bilbo, \\nand  of  Frodo  his  heir,  they  suddenly  became,  by  no  wish  of \\ntheir  own,  both  important  and  renowned,  and  troubled  the \\ncounsels  of  the  Wise  and  the  Great. \\n\\nThose  days,  the  Third  Age  of  Middle-earth,  are  now  long \\npast,  and  the  shape  of  all  lands  has  been  changed;  but  the \\nregions  in  which  Hobbits  then  lived  were  doubtless  the  same \\nas  those  in  which  they  still  linger:  the  North-West  of  the  Old \\nWorld,  east  of  the  Sea.  Of  their  original  home  the  Hobbits \\nin  Bilbo’s  time  preserved  no  knowledge.  A  love  of  learning \\n(other  than  genealogical  lore)  was  far  from  general  among \\nthem,  but  there  remained  still  a  few  in  the  older  families  who \\nstudied  their  own  books,  and  even  gathered  reports  of  old \\ntimes  and  distant  lands  from  Elves,  Dwarves,  and  Men.  Their \\nown  records  began  only  after  the  settlement  of  the  Shire,  and \\ntheir  most  ancient  legends  hardly  looked  further  back  than \\ntheir  Wandering  Days.  It  is  clear,  nonetheless,  from  these \\nlegends,  and  from  the  evidence  of  their  peculiar  words  and \\ncustoms,  that  like  many  other  folk  Hobbits  had  in  the  distant \\npast  moved  westward.  Their  earliest  tales  seem  to  glimpse  a \\ntime  when  they  dwelt  in  the  upper  vales  of  Anduin,  between \\nthe  eaves  of  Greenwood  the  Great  and  the  Misty  Mountains. \\nWhy  they  later  undertook  the  hard  and  perilous  crossing  of \\nthe  mountains  into  Eriador  is  no  longer  certain.  Their  own \\naccounts  speak  of  the  multiplying  of  Men  in  the  land,  and  of \\n\\n\\n4 \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\na  shadow  that  fell  on  the  forest,  so  that  it  became  darkened \\nand  its  new  name  was  Mirkwood. \\n\\nBefore  the  crossing  of  the  mountains  the  Hobbits  had \\nalready  become  divided  into  three  somewhat  different  breeds: \\nHarfoots,  Stoors,  and  Fallohides.  The  Harfoots  were  browner \\nof  skin,  smaller,  and  shorter,  and  they  were  beardless  and \\nbootless;  their  hands  and  feet  were  neat  and  nimble;  and  they \\npreferred  highlands  and  hillsides.  The  Stoors  were  broader, \\nheavier  in  build;  their  feet  and  hands  were  larger;  and  they \\npreferred  flat  lands  and  riversides.  The  Fallohides  were  fairer \\nof  skin  and  also  of  hair,  and  they  were  taller  and  slimmer \\nthan  the  others;  they  were  lovers  of  trees  and  of  woodlands. \\n\\nThe  Harfoots  had  much  to  do  with  Dwarves  in  ancient \\ntimes,  and  long  lived  in  the  foothills  of  the  mountains.  They \\nmoved  westward  early,  and  roamed  over  Eriador  as  far  as \\nWeathertop  while  the  others  were  still  in  Wilderland.  They \\nwere  the  most  normal  and  representative  variety  of  Hobbit, \\nand  far  the  most  numerous.  They  were  the  most  inclined  to \\nsettle  in  one  place,  and  longest  preserved  their  ancestral  habit \\nof  living  in  tunnels  and  holes. \\n\\nThe  Stoors  lingered  long  by  the  banks  of  the  Great  River \\nAnduin,  and  were  less  shy  of  Men.  They  came  west  after  the \\nHarfoots  and  followed  the  course  of  the  Loudwater  south¬ \\nwards;  and  there  many  of  them  long  dwelt  between  Tharbad \\nand  the  borders  of  Dunland  before  they  moved  north  again. \\n\\nThe  Fallohides,  the  least  numerous,  were  a  northerly \\nbranch.  They  were  more  friendly  with  Elves  than  the  other \\nHobbits  were,  and  had  more  skill  in  language  and  song  than \\nin  handicrafts;  and  of  old  they  preferred  hunting  to  tilling. \\nThey  crossed  the  mountains  north  of  Rivendell  and  came \\ndown  the  River  Hoarwell.  In  Eriador  they  soon  mingled  with \\nthe  other  kinds  that  had  preceded  them,  but  being  somewhat \\nbolder  and  more  adventurous,  they  were  often  found  as \\nleaders  or  chieftains  among  clans  of  Harfoots  or  Stoors.  Even \\nin  Bilbo’s  time  the  strong  Fallohidish  strain  could  still  be \\nnoted  among  the  greater  families,  such  as  the  Tooks  and  the \\nMasters  of  Buckland. \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\n5 \\n\\n\\nIn  the  westlands  of  Eriador,  between  the  Misty  Mountains \\nand  the  Mountains  of  Lune,  the  Hobbits  found  both  Men  and \\nElves.  Indeed,  a  remnant  still  dwelt  there  of  the  Dunedain,  the \\nkings  of  Men  that  came  over  the  Sea  out  of  Westernesse;  but \\nthey  were  dwindling  fast  and  the  lands  of  their  North  King¬ \\ndom  were  falling  far  and  wide  into  waste.  There  was  room \\nand  to  spare  for  incomers,  and  ere  long  the  Hobbits  began \\nto  settle  in  ordered  communities.  Most  of  their  earlier  settle¬ \\nments  had  long  disappeared  and  been  forgotten  in  Bilbo’s \\ntime;  but  one  of  the  first  to  become  important  still  endured, \\nthough  reduced  in  size;  this  was  at  Bree  and  in  the  Chetwood \\nthat  lay  round  about,  some  forty  miles  east  of  the  Shire. \\n\\nIt  was  in  these  early  days,  doubtless,  that  the  Hobbits \\nlearned  their  letters  and  began  to  write  after  the  manner  of \\nthe  Dunedain,  who  had  in  their  turn  long  before  learned  the \\nart  from  the  Elves.  And  in  those  days  also  they  forgot  what¬ \\never  languages  they  had  used  before,  and  spoke  ever  after  the \\nCommon  Speech,  the  Westron  as  it  was  named,  that  was \\ncurrent  through  all  the  lands  of  the  kings  from  Arnor  to \\nGondor,  and  about  all  the  coasts  of  the  Sea  from  Belfalas  to \\nLune.  Yet  they  kept  a  few  words  of  their  own,  as  well  as  their \\nown  names  of  months  and  days,  and  a  great  store  of  personal \\nnames  out  of  the  past. \\n\\nAbout  this  time  legend  among  the  Hobbits  first  becomes \\nhistory  with  a  reckoning  of  years.  For  it  was  in  the  one  thou¬ \\nsand  six  hundred  and  first  year  of  the  Third  Age  that  the \\nFallohide  brothers,  Marcho  and  Blanco,  set  out  from  Bree; \\nand  having  obtained  permission  from  the  high  king  at \\nFornost,*  they  crossed  the  brown  river  Baranduin  with  a \\ngreat  following  of  Hobbits.  They  passed  over  the  Bridge  of \\nStonebows,  that  had  been  built  in  the  days  of  the  power  of \\nthe  North  Kingdom,  and  they  took  all  the  land  beyond  to \\ndwell  in,  between  the  river  and  the  Far  Downs.  All  that  was \\n\\n\\n*  As  the  records  of  Gondor  relate  this  was  Argeleb  II,  the  twentieth \\nof  the  Northern  line,  which  came  to  an  end  with  Arvedui  three  hundred \\nyears  later. \\n\\n\\n6 \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\ndemanded  of  them  was  that  they  should  keep  the  Great \\nBridge  in  repair,  and  all  other  bridges  and  roads,  speed  the \\nking’s  messengers,  and  acknowledge  his  lordship. \\n\\nThus  began  the  Shire-reckoning ,  for  the  year  of  the  crossing \\nof  the  Brandywine  (as  the  Hobbits  turned  the  name)  became \\nYear  One  of  the  Shire,  and  all  later  dates  were  reckoned  from \\nit.*  At  once  the  western  Hobbits  fell  in  love  with  their  new \\nland,  and  they  remained  there,  and  soon  passed  once  more \\nout  of  the  history  of  Men  and  of  Elves.  While  there  was  still \\na  king  they  were  in  name  his  subjects,  but  they  were,  in  fact, \\nruled  by  their  own  chieftains  and  meddled  not  at  all  with \\nevents  in  the  world  outside.  To  the  last  battle  at  Fornost  with \\nthe  Witch-lord  of  Angmar  they  sent  some  bowmen  to  the  aid \\nof  the  king,  or  so  they  maintained,  though  no  tales  of  Men \\nrecord  it.  But  in  that  war  the  North  Kingdom  ended;  and \\nthen  the  Hobbits  took  the  land  for  their  own,  and  they  chose \\nfrom  their  own  chiefs  a  Thain  to  hold  the  authority  of  the \\nking  that  was  gone.  There  for  a  thousand  years  they  were \\nlittle  troubled  by  wars,  and  they  prospered  and  multiplied \\nafter  the  Dark  Plague  (S.R.  37)  until  the  disaster  of  the  Long \\nWinter  and  the  famine  that  followed  it.  Many  thousands  then \\nperished,  but  the  Days  of  Dearth  (1158-60)  were  at  the  time \\nof  this  tale  long  past  and  the  Hobbits  had  again  become \\naccustomed  to  plenty.  The  land  was  rich  and  kindly,  and \\nthough  it  had  long  been  deserted  when  they  entered  it,  it  had \\nbefore  been  well  tilled,  and  there  the  king  had  once  had  many \\nfarms,  cornlands,  vineyards,  and  woods. \\n\\nForty  leagues  it  stretched  from  the  Far  Downs  to  the \\nBrandywine  Bridge,  and  fifty  from  the  northern  moors  to \\nthe  marshes  in  the  south.  The  Hobbits  named  it  the  Shire, \\nas  the  region  of  the  authority  of  their  Thain,  and  a  district \\nof  well-ordered  business;  and  there  in  that  pleasant  corner  of \\nthe  world  they  plied  their  well-ordered  business  of  living,  and \\n\\n\\n*  Thus,  the  years  of  the  Third  Age  in  the  reckoning  of  the  Elves  and \\nthe  Dunedain  may  be  found  by  adding  1600  to  the  dates  of  Shire¬ \\nreckoning. \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\n\\nthey  heeded  less  and  less  the  world  outside  where  dark  things \\nmoved,  until  they  came  to  think  that  peace  and  plenty  were \\nthe  rule  in  Middle-earth  and  the  right  of  all  sensible  folk. \\nThey  forgot  or  ignored  what  little  they  had  ever  known  of \\nthe  Guardians,  and  of  the  labours  of  those  that  made  possible \\nthe  long  peace  of  the  Shire.  They  were,  in  fact,  sheltered,  but \\nthey  had  ceased  to  remember  it. \\n\\nAt  no  time  had  Hobbits  of  any  kind  been  warlike,  and  they \\nhad  never  fought  among  themselves.  In  olden  days  they  had, \\nof  course,  been  often  obliged  to  fight  to  maintain  themselves \\nin  a  hard  world;  but  in  Bilbo’s  time  that  was  very  ancient \\nhistory.  The  last  battle,  before  this  story  opens,  and  indeed \\nthe  only  one  that  had  ever  been  fought  within  the  borders \\nof  the  Shire,  was  beyond  living  memory:  the  Battle  of \\nGreenfields,  S.R.  1147,  in  which  Bandobras  Took  routed  an \\ninvasion  of  Ores.  Even  the  weathers  had  grown  milder,  and \\nthe  wolves  that  had  once  come  ravening  out  of  the  North  in \\nbitter  white  winters  were  now  only  a  grandfather’s  tale.  So, \\nthough  there  was  still  some  store  of  weapons  in  the  Shire, \\nthese  were  used  mostly  as  trophies,  hanging  above  hearths  or \\non  walls,  or  gathered  into  the  museum  at  Michel  Delving. \\nThe  Mathom-house  it  was  called;  for  anything  that  Hobbits \\nhad  no  immediate  use  for,  but  were  unwilling  to  throw  away, \\nthey  called  a  mathom.  Their  dwellings  were  apt  to  become \\nrather  crowded  with  mathoms,  and  many  of  the  presents  that \\npassed  from  hand  to  hand  were  of  that  sort. \\n\\nNonetheless,  ease  and  peace  had  left  this  people  still  curi¬ \\nously  tough.  They  were,  if  it  came  to  it,  difficult  to  daunt  or \\nto  kill;  and  they  were,  perhaps,  so  unwearyingly  fond  of  good \\nthings  not  least  because  they  could,  when  put  to  it,  do  without \\nthem,  and  could  survive  rough  handling  by  grief,  foe,  or \\nweather  in  a  way  that  astonished  those  who  did  not  know \\nthem  well  and  looked  no  further  than  their  bellies  and  their \\nwell-fed  faces.  Though  slow  to  quarrel,  and  for  sport  killing \\nnothing  that  lived,  they  were  doughty  at  bay,  and  at  need \\ncould  still  handle  arms.  They  shot  well  with  the  bow,  for  they \\nwere  keen-eyed  and  sure  at  the  mark.  Not  only  with  bows  and \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\narrows.  If  any  Hobbit  stooped  for  a  stone,  it  was  well  to  get \\nquickly  under  cover,  as  all  trespassing  beasts  knew  very  well. \\n\\nAll  Hobbits  had  originally  lived  in  holes  in  the  ground,  or \\nso  they  believed,  and  in  such  dwellings  they  still  felt  most  at \\nhome;  but  in  the  course  of  time  they  had  been  obliged  to \\nadopt  other  forms  of  abode.  Actually  in  the  Shire  in  Bilbo’s \\ndays  it  was,  as  a  rule,  only  the  richest  and  the  poorest  Hobbits \\nthat  maintained  the  old  custom.  The  poorest  went  on  living \\nin  burrows  of  the  most  primitive  kind,  mere  holes  indeed, \\nwith  only  one  window  or  none;  while  the  well-to-do  still \\nconstructed  more  luxurious  versions  of  the  simple  diggings \\nof  old.  But  suitable  sites  for  these  large  and  ramifying  tunnels \\n(or  smials  as  they  called  them)  were  not  everywhere  to  be \\nfound;  and  in  the  flats  and  the  low-lying  districts  the  Hobbits, \\nas  they  multiplied,  began  to  build  above  ground.  Indeed,  even \\nin  the  hilly  regions  and  the  older  villages,  such  as  Hobbiton \\nor  Tuckborough,  or  in  the  chief  township  of  the  Shire,  Michel \\nDelving  on  the  White  Downs,  there  were  now  many  houses \\nof  wood,  brick,  or  stone.  These  were  specially  favoured  by \\nmillers,  smiths,  ropers,  and  Cartwrights,  and  others  of  that \\nsort;  for  even  when  they  had  holes  to  live  in,  Hobbits  had \\nlong  been  accustomed  to  build  sheds  and  workshops. \\n\\nThe  habit  of  building  farmhouses  and  barns  was  said  to \\nhave  begun  among  the  inhabitants  of  the  Marish  down  by \\nthe  Brandywine.  The  Hobbits  of  that  quarter,  the  East¬ \\nfarthing,  were  rather  large  and  heavy-legged,  and  they  wore \\ndwarf-boots  in  muddy  weather.  But  they  were  well  known  to \\nbe  Stoors  in  a  large  part  of  their  blood,  as  indeed  was  shown \\nby  the  down  that  many  grew  on  their  chins.  No  Harfoot  or \\nFallohide  had  any  trace  of  a  beard.  Indeed,  the  folk  of  the \\nMarish,  and  of  Buckland,  east  of  the  River,  which  they  after¬ \\nwards  occupied,  came  for  the  most  part  later  into  the  Shire \\nup  from  south-away;  and  they  still  had  many  peculiar  names \\nand  strange  words  not  found  elsewhere  in  the  Shire. \\n\\nIt  is  probable  that  the  craft  of  building,  as  many  other  crafts \\nbeside,  was  derived  from  the  Dunedain.  But  the  Hobbits  may \\nhave  learned  it  direct  from  the  Elves,  the  teachers  of  Men  in \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\ntheir  youth.  For  the  Elves  of  the  High  Kindred  had  not  yet \\nforsaken  Middle-earth,  and  they  dwelt  still  at  that  time  at  the \\nGrey  Havens  away  to  the  west,  and  in  other  places  within \\nreach  of  the  Shire.  Three  Elf- towers  of  immemorial  age  were \\nstill  to  be  seen  on  the  Tower  Hills  beyond  the  western \\nmarches.  They  shone  far  off  in  the  moonlight.  The  tallest \\nwas  furthest  away,  standing  alone  upon  a  green  mound.  The \\nHobbits  of  the  Westfarthing  said  that  one  could  see  the  Sea \\nfrom  the  top  of  that  tower;  but  no  Hobbit  had  ever  been \\nknown  to  climb  it.  Indeed,  few  Hobbits  had  ever  seen  or \\nsailed  upon  the  Sea,  and  fewer  still  had  ever  returned  to \\nreport  it.  Most  Hobbits  regarded  even  rivers  and  small  boats \\nwith  deep  misgivings,  and  not  many  of  them  could  swim. \\nAnd  as  the  days  of  the  Shire  lengthened  they  spoke  less  and \\nless  with  the  Elves,  and  grew  afraid  of  them,  and  distrustful \\nof  those  that  had  dealings  with  them;  and  the  Sea  became  a \\nword  of  fear  among  them,  and  a  token  of  death,  and  they \\nturned  their  faces  away  from  the  hills  in  the  west. \\n\\nThe  craft  of  building  may  have  come  from  Elves  or  Men, \\nbut  the  Hobbits  used  it  in  their  own  fashion.  They  did  not \\ngo  in  for  towers.  Their  houses  were  usually  long,  low,  and \\ncomfortable.  The  oldest  kind  were,  indeed,  no  more  than \\nbuilt  imitations  of  smials ,  thatched  with  dry  grass  or  straw,  or \\nroofed  with  turves,  and  having  walls  somewhat  bulged.  That \\nstage,  however,  belonged  to  the  early  days  of  the  Shire,  and \\nhobbit-building  had  long  since  been  altered,  improved  by \\ndevices,  learned  from  Dwarves,  or  discovered  by  themselves. \\nA  preference  for  round  windows,  and  even  round  doors,  was \\nthe  chief  remaining  peculiarity  of  hobbit-architecture. \\n\\nThe  houses  and  the  holes  of  Shire-hobbits  were  often  large, \\nand  inhabited  by  large  families.  (Bilbo  and  Frodo  Baggins \\nwere  as  bachelors  very  exceptional,  as  they  were  also  in  many \\nother  ways,  such  as  their  friendship  with  the  Elves.)  Some¬ \\ntimes,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Tooks  of  Great  Smials,  or  the \\nBrandybucks  of  Brandy  Hall,  many  generations  of  relatives \\nlived  in  (comparative)  peace  together  in  one  ancestral  and \\nmany-tunnelled  mansion.  All  Hobbits  were,  in  any  case, \\n\\n\\nIO \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\nclannish  and  reckoned  up  their  relationships  with  great  care. \\nThey  drew  long  and  elaborate  family-trees  with  innumerable \\nbranches.  In  dealing  with  Hobbits  it  is  important  to  remember \\nwho  is  related  to  whom,  and  in  what  degree.  It  would  be \\nimpossible  in  this  book  to  set  out  a  family-tree  that  included \\neven  the  more  important  members  of  the  more  important \\nfamilies  at  the  time  which  these  tales  tell  of.  The  genealogical \\ntrees  at  the  end  of  the  Red  Book  of  Westmarch  are  a  small \\nbook  in  themselves,  and  all  but  Hobbits  would  find  them \\nexceedingly  dull.  Hobbits  delighted  in  such  things,  if  they  were \\naccurate:  they  liked  to  have  books  filled  with  things  that  they \\nalready  knew,  set  out  fair  and  square  with  no  contradictions. \\n\\n\\n2 \\n\\nConcerning  Pipe-weed \\n\\nThere  is  another  astonishing  thing  about  Hobbits  of  old  that \\nmust  be  mentioned,  an  astonishing  habit:  they  imbibed  or \\ninhaled,  through  pipes  of  clay  or  wood,  the  smoke  of  the \\nburning  leaves  of  a  herb,  which  they  called  pipe-weed  or  leaf, \\na  variety  probably  of  Nicotiana.  A  great  deal  of  mystery \\nsurrounds  the  origin  of  this  peculiar  custom,  or  ‘art’  as  the \\nHobbits  preferred  to  call  it.  All  that  could  be  discovered  about \\nit  in  antiquity  was  put  together  by  Meriadoc  Brandybuck \\n(later  Master  of  Buckland),  and  since  he  and  the  tobacco  of \\nthe  Southfarthing  play  a  part  in  the  history  that  follows,  his \\nremarks  in  the  introduction  to  his  Herblore  of  the  Shire  may \\nbe  quoted. \\n\\n‘This,’  he  says,  ‘is  the  one  art  that  we  can  certainly  claim \\nto  be  our  own  invention.  When  Hobbits  first  began  to  smoke \\nis  not  known,  all  the  legends  and  family  histories  take  it  for \\ngranted;  for  ages  folk  in  the  Shire  smoked  various  herbs,  some \\nfouler,  some  sweeter.  But  all  accounts  agree  that  Tobold \\nHornblower  of  Longbottom  in  the  Southfarthing  first  grew \\nthe  true  pipe-weed  in  his  gardens  in  the  days  of  Isengrim  the \\nSecond,  about  the  year  1070  of  Shire -reckoning.  The  best \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\nII \\n\\n\\nhome-grown  still  comes  from  that  district,  especially  the \\nvarieties  now  known  as  Longbottom  Leaf,  Old  Toby,  and \\nSouthern  Star. \\n\\n‘How  Old  Toby  came  by  the  plant  is  not  recorded,  for  to \\nhis  dying  day  he  would  not  tell.  He  knew  much  about  herbs, \\nbut  he  was  no  traveller.  It  is  said  that  in  his  youth  he  went \\noften  to  Bree,  though  he  certainly  never  went  further  from \\nthe  Shire  than  that.  It  is  thus  quite  possible  that  he  learned \\nof  this  plant  in  Bree,  where  now,  at  any  rate,  it  grows  well  on \\nthe  south  slopes  of  the  hill.  The  Bree-hobbits  claim  to  have \\nbeen  the  first  actual  smokers  of  the  pipe-weed.  They  claim, \\nof  course,  to  have  done  everything  before  the  people  of  the \\nShire,  whom  they  refer  to  as  “colonists”;  but  in  this  case  their \\nclaim  is,  I  think,  likely  to  be  true.  And  certainly  it  was  from \\nBree  that  the  art  of  smoking  the  genuine  weed  spread  in \\nthe  recent  centuries  among  Dwarves  and  such  other  folk, \\nRangers,  Wizards,  or  wanderers,  as  still  passed  to  and  fro \\nthrough  that  ancient  road-meeting.  The  home  and  centre  of \\nthe  art  is  thus  to  be  found  in  the  old  inn  of  Bree,  The  Prancing \\nPony,  that  has  been  kept  by  the  family  of  Butterbur  from \\ntime  beyond  record. \\n\\n‘All  the  same,  observations  that  I  have  made  on  my  own \\nmany  journeys  south  have  convinced  me  that  the  weed  itself \\nis  not  native  to  our  parts  of  the  world,  but  came  northward \\nfrom  the  lower  Anduin,  whither  it  was,  I  suspect,  originally \\nbrought  over  Sea  by  the  Men  of  Westernesse.  It  grows  abund¬ \\nantly  in  Gondor,  and  there  is  richer  and  larger  than  in  the \\nNorth,  where  it  is  never  found  wild,  and  flourishes  only  in \\nwarm  sheltered  places  like  Longbottom.  The  Men  of  Gondor \\ncall  it  sweet  galenas,  and  esteem  it  only  for  the  fragrance  of  its \\nflowers.  From  that  land  it  must  have  been  carried  up  the \\nGreenway  during  the  long  centuries  between  the  coming  of \\nElendil  and  our  own  days.  But  even  the  Dunedain  of  Gondor \\nallow  us  this  credit:  Hobbits  first  put  it  into  pipes.  Not  even \\nthe  Wizards  first  thought  of  that  before  we  did.  Though  one \\nWizard  that  I  knew  took  up  the  art  long  ago,  and  became  as \\nskilful  in  it  as  in  all  other  things  that  he  put  his  mind  to.’ \\n\\n\\n12 \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\nOf  the  Ordering  of  the  Shire \\n\\nThe  Shire  was  divided  into  four  quarters,  the  Farthings \\nalready  referred  to,  North,  South,  East,  and  West;  and  these \\nagain  each  into  a  number  of  folklands,  which  still  bore  the \\nnames  of  some  of  the  old  leading  families,  although  by  the \\ntime  of  this  history  these  names  were  no  longer  found  only \\nin  their  proper  folklands.  Nearly  all  Tooks  still  lived  in  the \\nTookland,  but  that  was  not  true  of  many  other  families,  such \\nas  the  Bagginses  or  the  Boffins.  Outside  the  Farthings  were \\nthe  East  and  West  Marches:  the  Buckland  (p.  129);  and  the \\nWestmarch  added  to  the  Shire  in  S.R.  1452. \\n\\nThe  Shire  at  this  time  had  hardly  any  ‘government’. \\nFamilies  for  the  most  part  managed  their  own  affairs.  Grow¬ \\ning  food  and  eating  it  occupied  most  of  their  time.  In \\nother  matters  they  were,  as  a  rule,  generous  and  not  greedy, \\nbut  contented  and  moderate,  so  that  estates,  farms,  work¬ \\nshops,  and  small  trades  tended  to  remain  unchanged  for \\ngenerations. \\n\\nThere  remained,  of  course,  the  ancient  tradition  concern¬ \\ning  the  high  king  at  Fornost,  or  Norbury  as  they  called  it, \\naway  north  of  the  Shire.  But  there  had  been  no  king  for  nearly \\na  thousand  years,  and  even  the  ruins  of  Kings’  Norbury  were \\ncovered  with  grass.  Yet  the  Hobbits  still  said  of  wild  folk  and \\nwicked  things  (such  as  trolls)  that  they  had  not  heard  of  the \\nking.  For  they  attributed  to  the  king  of  old  all  their  essential \\nlaws;  and  usually  they  kept  the  laws  of  free  will,  because  they \\nwere  The  Rules  (as  they  said),  both  ancient  and  just. \\n\\nIt  is  true  that  the  Took  family  had  long  been  pre-eminent; \\nfor  the  office  of  Thain  had  passed  to  them  (from  the  Old- \\nbucks)  some  centuries  before,  and  the  chief  Took  had  borne \\nthat  title  ever  since.  The  Thain  was  the  master  of  the  Shire- \\nmoot,  and  captain  of  the  Shire-muster  and  the  Hobbitry-in- \\narms;  but  as  muster  and  moot  were  only  held  in  times  of \\nemergency,  which  no  longer  occurred,  the  Thainship  had \\nceased  to  be  more  than  a  nominal  dignity.  The  Took  family \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\n13 \\n\\n\\nwas  still,  indeed,  accorded  a  special  respect,  for  it  remained \\nboth  numerous  and  exceedingly  wealthy,  and  was  liable  to \\nproduce  in  every  generation  strong  characters  of  peculiar \\nhabits  and  even  adventurous  temperament.  The  latter  quali¬ \\nties,  however,  were  now  rather  tolerated  (in  the  rich)  than \\ngenerally  approved.  The  custom  endured,  nonetheless,  of \\nreferring  to  the  head  of  the  family  as  The  Took,  and  of \\nadding  to  his  name,  if  required,  a  number:  such  as  Isengrim \\nthe  Second,  for  instance. \\n\\nThe  only  real  official  in  the  Shire  at  this  date  was  the  Mayor \\nof  Michel  Delving  (or  of  the  Shire),  who  was  elected  every \\nseven  years  at  the  Free  Fair  on  the  White  Downs  at  the  Lithe, \\nthat  is  at  Midsummer.  As  mayor  almost  his  only  duty  was \\nto  preside  at  banquets,  given  on  the  Shire-holidays,  which \\noccurred  at  frequent  intervals.  But  the  offices  of  Postmaster \\nand  First  Shirriff  were  attached  to  the  mayoralty,  so  that  he \\nmanaged  both  the  Messenger  Service  and  the  Watch.  These \\nwere  the  only  Shire-services,  and  the  Messengers  were  the \\nmost  numerous,  and  much  the  busier  of  the  two.  By  no \\nmeans  all  Hobbits  were  lettered,  but  those  who  were  wrote \\nconstantly  to  all  their  friends  (and  a  selection  of  their \\nrelations)  who  lived  further  off  than  an  afternoon’s  walk. \\n\\nThe  Shirriffs  was  the  name  that  the  Hobbits  gave  to  their \\npolice,  or  the  nearest  equivalent  that  they  possessed.  They \\nhad,  of  course,  no  uniforms  (such  things  being  quite  un¬ \\nknown),  only  a  feather  in  their  caps;  and  they  were  in  practice \\nrather  haywards  than  policemen,  more  concerned  with  the \\nstrayings  of  beasts  than  of  people.  There  were  in  all  the  Shire \\nonly  twelve  of  them,  three  in  each  Farthing,  for  Inside  Work. \\nA  rather  larger  body,  varying  at  need,  was  employed  to  ‘beat \\nthe  bounds’,  and  to  see  that  Outsiders  of  any  land,  great  or \\nsmall,  did  not  make  themselves  a  nuisance. \\n\\nAt  the  time  when  this  story  begins  the  Bounders,  as  they \\nwere  called,  had  been  greatly  increased.  There  were  many \\nreports  and  complaints  of  strange  persons  and  creatures \\nprowling  about  the  borders,  or  over  them:  the  first  sign  that \\nall  was  not  quite  as  it  should  be,  and  always  had  been  except \\n\\n\\n14 \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\nin  tales  and  legends  of  long  ago.  Few  heeded  the  sign,  and \\nnot  even  Bilbo  yet  had  any  notion  of  what  it  portended.  Sixty \\nyears  had  passed  since  he  set  out  on  his  memorable  journey, \\nand  he  was  old  even  for  Hobbits,  who  reached  a  hundred \\nas  often  as  not;  but  much  evidently  still  remained  of  the \\nconsiderable  wealth  that  he  had  brought  back.  How  much  or \\nhow  little  he  revealed  to  no  one,  not  even  to  Frodo  his  favour¬ \\nite  ‘nephew’.  And  he  still  kept  secret  the  ring  that  he  had \\nfound. \\n\\n\\n4 \\n\\nOf  the  Finding  of  the  Ring \\n\\nAs  is  told  in  The  Hobbit,  there  came  one  day  to  Bilbo’s  door  the \\ngreat  Wizard,  Gandalf  the  Grey,  and  thirteen  dwarves  with \\nhim:  none  other,  indeed,  than  Thorin  Oakenshield,  descend¬ \\nant  of  kings,  and  his  twelve  companions  in  exile.  With  them \\nhe  set  out,  to  his  own  lasting  astonishment,  on  a  morning  of \\nApril,  it  being  then  the  year  1341  Shire -reckoning,  on  a  quest \\nof  great  treasure,  the  dwarf-hoards  of  the  Kings  under  the \\nMountain,  beneath  Erebor  in  Dale,  far  off  in  the  East.  The \\nquest  was  successful,  and  the  Dragon  that  guarded  the  hoard \\nwas  destroyed.  Yet,  though  before  all  was  won  the  Battle  of \\nFive  Armies  was  fought,  and  Thorin  was  slain,  and  many \\ndeeds  of  renown  were  done,  the  matter  would  scarcely  have \\nconcerned  later  history,  or  earned  more  than  a  note  in \\nthe  long  annals  of  the  Third  Age,  but  for  an  ‘accident’  by  the \\nway.  The  party  was  assailed  by  Ores  in  a  high  pass  of  the \\nMisty  Mountains  as  they  went  towards  Wilderland;  and  so  it \\nhappened  that  Bilbo  was  lost  for  a  while  in  the  black  ore- \\nmines  deep  under  the  mountains,  and  there,  as  he  groped  in \\nvain  in  the  dark,  he  put  his  hand  on  a  ring,  lying  on  the  floor \\nof  a  tunnel.  He  put  it  in  his  pocket.  It  seemed  then  like  mere \\nluck. \\n\\nTrying  to  find  his  way  out,  Bilbo  went  on  down  to  the \\nroots  of  the  mountains,  until  he  could  go  no  further.  At  the \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\n15 \\n\\n\\nbottom  of  the  tunnel  lay  a  cold  lake  far  from  the  light,  and \\non  an  island  of  rock  in  the  water  lived  Gollum.  He  was  a \\nloathsome  little  creature:  he  paddled  a  small  boat  with  his \\nlarge  flat  feet,  peering  with  pale  luminous  eyes  and  catching \\nblind  fish  with  his  long  fingers,  and  eating  them  raw.  He  ate \\nany  living  thing,  even  ore,  if  he  could  catch  it  and  strangle  it \\nwithout  a  struggle.  He  possessed  a  secret  treasure  that  had \\ncome  to  him  long  ages  ago,  when  he  still  lived  in  the  light:  a \\nring  of  gold  that  made  its  wearer  invisible.  It  was  the  one \\nthing  he  loved,  his  ‘Precious’,  and  he  talked  to  it,  even  when \\nit  was  not  with  him.  For  he  kept  it  hidden  safe  in  a  hole  on \\nhis  island,  except  when  he  was  hunting  or  spying  on  the  ores \\nof  the  mines. \\n\\nMaybe  he  would  have  attacked  Bilbo  at  once,  if  the  ring \\nhad  been  on  him  when  they  met;  but  it  was  not,  and  the \\nhobbit  held  in  his  hand  an  Elvish  knife,  which  served  him  as \\na  sword.  So  to  gain  time  Gollum  challenged  Bilbo  to  the \\nRiddle -game,  saying  that  if  he  asked  a  riddle  which  Bilbo \\ncould  not  guess,  then  he  would  kill  him  and  eat  him;  but  if \\nBilbo  defeated  him,  then  he  would  do  as  Bilbo  wished:  he \\nwould  lead  him  to  a  way  out  of  the  tunnels. \\n\\nSince  he  was  lost  in  the  dark  without  hope,  and  could \\nneither  go  on  nor  back,  Bilbo  accepted  the  challenge;  and \\nthey  asked  one  another  many  riddles.  In  the  end  Bilbo  won \\nthe  game,  more  by  luck  (as  it  seemed)  than  by  wits;  for  he \\nwas  stumped  at  last  for  a  riddle  to  ask,  and  cried  out,  as  his \\nhand  came  upon  the  ring  he  had  picked  up  and  forgotten: \\nWhat  have  I  got  in  my  pocket?  This  Gollum  failed  to  answer, \\nthough  he  demanded  three  guesses. \\n\\nThe  Authorities,  it  is  true,  differ  whether  this  last  question \\nwas  a  mere  ‘question’  and  not  a  ‘riddle’  according  to  the  strict \\nrules  of  the  Game;  but  all  agree  that,  after  accepting  it  and \\ntrying  to  guess  the  answer,  Gollum  was  bound  by  his \\npromise.  And  Bilbo  pressed  him  to  keep  his  word;  for  the \\nthought  came  to  him  that  this  slimy  creature  might  prove \\nfalse,  even  though  such  promises  were  held  sacred,  and  of \\nold  all  but  the  wickedest  things  feared  to  break  them.  But \\n\\n\\ni6 \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\nafter  ages  alone  in  the  dark  Gollum’s  heart  was  black,  and \\ntreachery  was  in  it.  He  slipped  away,  and  returned  to  his \\nisland,  of  which  Bilbo  knew  nothing,  not  far  off  in  the  dark \\nwater.  There,  he  thought,  lay  his  ring.  He  was  hungry  now, \\nand  angry,  and  once  his  ‘Precious’  was  with  him  he  would \\nnot  fear  any  weapon  at  all. \\n\\nBut  the  ring  was  not  on  the  island;  he  had  lost  it,  it  was \\ngone.  His  screech  sent  a  shiver  down  Bilbo’s  back,  though  he \\ndid  not  yet  understand  what  had  happened.  But  Gollum  had \\nat  last  leaped  to  a  guess,  too  late.  What  has  it  got  in  its \\npocketses?  he  cried.  The  light  in  his  eyes  was  like  a  green \\nflame  as  he  sped  back  to  murder  the  hobbit  and  recover  his \\n‘Precious’.  Just  in  time  Bilbo  saw  his  peril,  and  he  fled  blindly \\nup  the  passage  away  from  the  water;  and  once  more  he  was \\nsaved  by  his  luck.  For  as  he  ran  he  put  his  hand  in  his  pocket, \\nand  the  ring  slipped  quietly  on  to  his  finger.  So  it  was  that \\nGollum  passed  him  without  seeing  him,  and  went  to  guard \\nthe  way  out,  lest  the  ‘thief’  should  escape.  Warily  Bilbo  fol¬ \\nlowed  him,  as  he  went  along,  cursing,  and  talking  to  himself \\nabout  his  ‘Precious’;  from  which  talk  at  last  even  Bilbo \\nguessed  the  truth,  and  hope  came  to  him  in  the  darkness:  he \\nhimself  had  found  the  marvellous  ring  and  a  chance  of  escape \\nfrom  the  ores  and  from  Gollum. \\n\\nAt  length  they  came  to  a  halt  before  an  unseen  opening \\nthat  led  to  the  lower  gates  of  the  mines,  on  the  eastward  side \\nof  the  mountains.  There  Gollum  crouched  at  bay,  smelling \\nand  listening;  and  Bilbo  was  tempted  to  slay  him  with  his \\nsword.  But  pity  stayed  him,  and  though  he  kept  the  ring,  in \\nwhich  his  only  hope  lay,  he  would  not  use  it  to  help  him  kill \\nthe  wretched  creature  at  a  disadvantage.  In  the  end,  gathering \\nhis  courage,  he  leaped  over  Gollum  in  the  dark,  and  fled \\naway  down  the  passage,  pursued  by  his  enemy’s  cries  of  hate \\nand  despair:  Thief,  thief!  Baggins!  We  hates  it  for  ever! \\n\\nNow  it  is  a  curious  fact  that  this  is  not  the  story  as  Bilbo \\nfirst  told  it  to  his  companions.  To  them  his  account  was  that \\nGollum  had  promised  to  give  him  a  present ,  if  he  won  the \\n\\n\\nPROLOGUE \\n\\n\\n17 \\n\\n\\ngame;  but  when  Gollum  went  to  fetch  it  from  his  island  he \\nfound  the  treasure  was  gone:  a  magic  ring,  which  had  been \\ngiven  to  him  long  ago  on  his  birthday.  Bilbo  guessed  that  this \\nwas  the  very  ring  that  he  had  found,  and  as  he  had  won  the \\ngame,  it  was  already  his  by  right.  But  being  in  a  tight  place, \\nhe  said  nothing  about  it,  and  made  Gollum  show  him  the \\nway  out,  as  a  reward  instead  of  a  present.  This  account  Bilbo \\nset  down  in  his  memoirs,  and  he  seems  never  to  have  altered \\nit  himself,  not  even  after  the  Council  of  Elrond.  Evidently  it \\nstill  appeared  in  the  original  Red  Book,  as  it  did  in  several  of \\nthe  copies  and  abstracts.  But  many  copies  contain  the  true \\naccount  (as  an  alternative),  derived  no  doubt  from  notes  by \\nFrodo  or  Samwise,  both  of  whom  learned  the  truth,  though \\nthey  seem  to  have  been  unwilling  to  delete  anything  actually \\nwritten  by  the  old  hobbit  himself. \\n\\nGandalf,  however,  disbelieved  Bilbo’s  first  story,  as  soon \\nas  he  heard  it,  and  he  continued  to  be  very  curious  about  the \\nring.  Eventually  he  got  the  true  tale  out  of  Bilbo  after  much \\nquestioning,  which  for  a  while  strained  their  friendship;  but \\nthe  wizard  seemed  to  think  the  truth  important.  Though  he \\ndid  not  say  so  to  Bilbo,  he  also  thought  it  important,  and \\ndisturbing,  to  find  that  the  good  hobbit  had  not  told  the \\ntruth  from  the  first:  quite  contrary  to  his  habit.  The  idea  of  a \\n‘present’  was  not  mere  hobbitlike  invention,  all  the  same.  It \\nwas  suggested  to  Bilbo,  as  he  confessed,  by  Gollum’s  talk \\nthat  he  overheard;  for  Gollum  did,  in  fact,  call  the  ring  his \\n‘birthday-present’,  many  times.  That  also  Gandalf  thought \\nstrange  and  suspicious;  but  he  did  not  discover  the  truth \\nin  this  point  for  many  more  years,  as  will  be  seen  in  this \\nbook. \\n\\nOf  Bilbo’s  later  adventures  little  more  need  be  said  here. \\nWith  the  help  of  the  ring  he  escaped  from  the  ore-guards  at \\nthe  gate  and  rejoined  his  companions.  He  used  the  ring  many \\ntimes  on  his  quest,  chiefly  for  the  help  of  his  friends;  but  he \\nkept  it  secret  from  them  as  long  as  he  could.  After  his  return \\nto  his  home  he  never  spoke  of  it  again  to  anyone,  save  Gandalf \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  SHIRE  RECORDS \\n\\n\\nand  Frodo;  and  no  one  else  in  the  Shire  knew  of  its  existence, \\nor  so  he  believed.  Only  to  Frodo  did  he  show  the  account  of \\nhis  Journey  that  he  was  writing. \\n\\nHis  sword,  Sting,  Bilbo  hung  over  his  fireplace,  and  his \\ncoat  of  marvellous  mail,  the  gift  of  the  Dwarves  from  the \\nDragon-hoard,  he  lent  to  a  museum,  to  the  Michel  Delving \\nMathom-house  in  fact.  But  he  kept  in  a  drawer  at  Bag  End \\nthe  old  cloak  and  hood  that  he  had  worn  on  his  travels; \\nand  the  ring,  secured  by  a  fine  chain,  remained  in  his \\npocket. \\n\\nHe  returned  to  his  home  at  Bag  End  on  June  the  22nd  in \\nhis  fifty-second  year  (S.R.  1342),  and  nothing  very  notable \\noccurred  in  the  Shire  until  Mr.  Baggins  began  the  prep¬ \\narations  for  the  celebration  of  his  hundred-and-eleventh \\nbirthday  (S.R.  1401).  At  this  point  this  History  begins. \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  SHIRE  RECORDS \\n\\nAt  the  end  of  the  Third  Age  the  part  played  by  the  Hobbits \\nin  the  great  events  that  led  to  the  inclusion  of  the  Shire  in  the \\nReunited  Kingdom  awakened  among  them  a  more  wide¬ \\nspread  interest  in  their  own  history;  and  many  of  their  tra¬ \\nditions,  up  to  that  time  still  mainly  oral,  were  collected  and \\nwritten  down.  The  greater  families  were  also  concerned  with \\nevents  in  the  Kingdom  at  large,  and  many  of  their  members \\nstudied  its  ancient  histories  and  legends.  By  the  end  of  the \\nfirst  century  of  the  Fourth  Age  there  were  already  to  be  found \\nin  the  Shire  several  libraries  that  contained  many  historical \\nbooks  and  records. \\n\\nThe  largest  of  these  collections  were  probably  at  Under¬ \\ntowers,  at  Great  Smials,  and  at  Brandy  Hall.  This  account  of \\nthe  end  of  the  Third  Age  is  drawn  mainly  from  the  Red  Book \\nof  Westmarch.  That  most  important  source  for  the  history \\nof  the  War  of  the  Ring  was  so  called  because  it  was  long \\npreserved  at  Undertowers,  the  home  of  the  Fairbairns, \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  SHIRE  RECORDS \\n\\n\\n19 \\n\\n\\nWardens  of  the  Westmarch.*  It  was  in  origin  Bilbo’s  private \\ndiary,  which  he  took  with  him  to  Rivendell.  Frodo  brought  it \\nback  to  the  Shire,  together  with  many  loose  leaves  of  notes, \\nand  during  S.R.  1420-1  he  nearly  filled  its  pages  with  his \\naccount  of  the  War.  But  annexed  to  it  and  preserved  with  it, \\nprobably  in  a  single  red  case,  were  the  three  large  volumes, \\nbound  in  red  leather,  that  Bilbo  gave  to  him  as  a  parting  gift. \\nTo  these  four  volumes  there  was  added  in  Westmarch  a \\nfifth  containing  commentaries,  genealogies,  and  various  other \\nmatter  concerning  the  hobbit  members  of  the  Fellowship. \\n\\nThe  original  Red  Book  has  not  been  preserved,  but  many \\ncopies  were  made,  especially  of  the  first  volume,  for  the  use \\nof  the  descendants  of  the  children  of  Master  Samwise.  The \\nmost  important  copy,  however,  has  a  different  history.  It  was \\nkept  at  Great  Smials,  but  it  was  written  in  Gondor,  probably \\nat  the  request  of  the  great-grandson  of  Peregrin,  and  com¬ \\npleted  in  S.R.  1592  (F.A.  172).  Its  southern  scribe  appended \\nthis  note:  Findegil,  King’s  Writer,  finished  this  work  in  IV \\n172.  It  is  an  exact  copy  in  all  details  of  the  Thain’s  Book  in \\nMinas  Tirith.  That  book  was  a  copy,  made  at  the  request  of \\nKing  Elessar,  of  the  Red  Book  of  the  Periannath,  and  was \\nbrought  to  him  by  the  Thain  Peregrin  when  he  retired  to \\nGondor  in  IV  64. \\n\\nThe  Thain’s  Book  was  thus  the  first  copy  made  of  the  Red \\nBook  and  contained  much  that  was  later  omitted  or  lost.  In \\nMinas  Tirith  it  received  much  annotation,  and  many  correc¬ \\ntions,  especially  of  names,  words,  and  quotations  in  the  Elvish \\nlanguages;  and  there  was  added  to  it  an  abbreviated  version \\nof  those  parts  of  The  Tale  of  Aragorn  and  Arwen  which  lie \\noutside  the  account  of  the  War.  The  full  tale  is  stated  to  have \\nbeen  written  by  Barahir,  grandson  of  the  Steward  Faramir, \\nsome  time  after  the  passing  of  the  King.  But  the  chief  impor¬ \\ntance  of  Findegil’s  copy  is  that  it  alone  contains  the  whole  of \\nBilbo’s  ‘Translations  from  the  Elvish’.  These  three  volumes \\n\\n*  See  Appendix  B:  annals  1451,  1462,  1482;  and  note  at  end  of \\nAppendix  C. \\n\\n\\n20 \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  SHIRE  RECORDS \\n\\n\\nwere  found  to  be  a  work  of  great  skill  and  learning  in  which, \\nbetween  1403  and  1418,  he  had  used  all  the  sources  available \\nto  him  in  Rivendell,  both  living  and  written.  But  since  they \\nwere  little  used  by  Frodo,  being  almost  entirely  concerned \\nwith  the  Elder  Days,  no  more  is  said  of  them  here. \\n\\nSince  Meriadoc  and  Peregrin  became  the  heads  of  their \\ngreat  families,  and  at  the  same  time  kept  up  their  connexions \\nwith  Rohan  and  Gondor,  the  libraries  at  Bucklebury  and \\nTuckborough  contained  much  that  did  not  appear  in  the  Red \\nBook.  In  Brandy  Hall  there  were  many  works  dealing  with \\nEriador  and  the  history  of  Rohan.  Some  of  these  were \\ncomposed  or  begun  by  Meriadoc  himself,  though  in  the  Shire \\nhe  was  chiefly  remembered  for  his  Herblore  of  the  Shire ,  and \\nfor  his  Reckoning  of  Years  in  which  he  discussed  the  relation \\nof  the  calendars  of  the  Shire  and  Bree  to  those  of  Rivendell, \\nGondor,  and  Rohan.  He  also  wrote  a  short  treatise  on  Old \\nWords  and  Names  in  the  Shire ,  showing  special  interest  in \\ndiscovering  the  kinship  with  the  language  of  the  Rohirrim \\nof  such  ‘shire-words’  as  mathom  and  old  elements  in  place \\nnames. \\n\\nAt  Great  Smials  the  books  were  of  less  interest  to  Shire- \\nfolk,  though  more  important  for  larger  history.  None  of  them \\nwas  written  by  Peregrin,  but  he  and  his  successors  collected \\nmany  manuscripts  written  by  scribes  of  Gondor:  mainly \\ncopies  or  summaries  of  histories  or  legends  relating  to  Elendil \\nand  his  heirs.  Only  here  in  the  Shire  were  to  be  found  exten¬ \\nsive  materials  for  the  history  of  Numenor  and  the  arising  of \\nSauron.  It  was  probably  at  Great  Smials  that  The  Tale  of \\nYears*  was  put  together,  with  the  assistance  of  material \\ncollected  by  Meriadoc.  Though  the  dates  given  are  often \\nconjectural,  especially  for  the  Second  Age,  they  deserve  atten¬ \\ntion.  It  is  probable  that  Meriadoc  obtained  assistance  and \\ninformation  from  Rivendell,  which  he  visited  more  than  once. \\nThere,  though  Elrond  had  departed,  his  sons  long  remained, \\n\\n*  Represented  in  much  reduced  form  in  Appendix  B  as  far  as  the \\nend  of  the  Third  Age. \\n\\n\\nNOTE  ON  THE  SHIRE  RECORDS \\n\\n\\n21 \\n\\n\\ntogether  with  some  of  the  High-elven  folk.  It  is  said  that \\nCeleborn  went  to  dwell  there  after  the  departure  of  Galadriel; \\nbut  there  is  no  record  of  the  day  when  at  last  he  sought  the \\nGrey  Havens,  and  with  him  went  the  last  living  memory  of \\nthe  Elder  Days  in  Middle-earth. \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP \\nOF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nBEING  THE  FIRST  PART \\nOF \\n\\nThe  Lord  of  the  Rings \\n\\n\\nBOOK  ONE \\n\\n\\nChapter  I \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY \\n\\n\\nWhen  Mr.  Bilbo  Baggins  of  Bag  End  announced  that  he \\nwould  shortly  be  celebrating  his  eleventy-first  birthday  with \\na  party  of  special  magnificence,  there  was  much  talk  and \\nexcitement  in  Hobbiton. \\n\\nBilbo  was  very  rich  and  very  peculiar,  and  had  been  the \\nwonder  of  the  Shire  for  sixty  years,  ever  since  his  remarkable \\ndisappearance  and  unexpected  return.  The  riches  he  had \\nbrought  back  from  his  travels  had  now  become  a  local  legend, \\nand  it  was  popularly  believed,  whatever  the  old  folk  might \\nsay,  that  the  Hill  at  Bag  End  was  full  of  tunnels  stuffed  with \\ntreasure.  And  if  that  was  not  enough  for  fame,  there  was  also \\nhis  prolonged  vigour  to  marvel  at.  Time  wore  on,  but  it \\nseemed  to  have  little  effect  on  Mr.  Baggins.  At  ninety  he  was \\nmuch  the  same  as  at  fifty.  At  ninety-nine  they  began  to  call \\nhim  well-preserved,  but  unchanged  would  have  been  nearer  the \\nmark.  There  were  some  that  shook  their  heads  and  thought \\nthis  was  too  much  of  a  good  thing;  it  seemed  unfair  that \\nanyone  should  possess  (apparently)  perpetual  youth  as  well \\nas  (reputedly)  inexhaustible  wealth. \\n\\n‘It  will  have  to  be  paid  for,’  they  said.  ‘It  isn’t  natural,  and \\ntrouble  will  come  of  it!’ \\n\\nBut  so  far  trouble  had  not  come;  and  as  Mr.  Baggins  was \\ngenerous  with  his  money,  most  people  were  willing  to  for¬ \\ngive  him  his  oddities  and  his  good  fortune.  He  remained \\non  visiting  terms  with  his  relatives  (except,  of  course,  the \\nSackville-Bagginses),  and  he  had  many  devoted  admirers \\namong  the  hobbits  of  poor  and  unimportant  families.  But  he \\nhad  no  close  friends,  until  some  of  his  younger  cousins  began \\nto  grow  up. \\n\\n\\n28 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nThe  eldest  of  these,  and  Bilbo’s  favourite,  was  young  Frodo \\nBaggins.  When  Bilbo  was  ninety-nine  he  adopted  Frodo  as \\nhis  heir,  and  brought  him  to  live  at  Bag  End;  and  the  hopes  of \\nthe  Sackville-Bagginses  were  finally  dashed.  Bilbo  and  Frodo \\nhappened  to  have  the  same  birthday,  September  22nd.  ‘You \\nhad  better  come  and  live  here,  Frodo  my  lad,’  said  Bilbo \\none  day;  ‘and  then  we  can  celebrate  our  birthday-parties \\ncomfortably  together.’  At  that  time  Frodo  was  still  in  his \\ntweens,  as  the  hobbits  called  the  irresponsible  twenties \\nbetween  childhood  and  coming  of  age  at  thirty-three. \\n\\nTwelve  more  years  passed.  Each  year  the  Bagginses  had \\ngiven  very  lively  combined  birthday-parties  at  Bag  End;  but \\nnow  it  was  understood  that  something  quite  exceptional \\nwas  being  planned  for  that  autumn.  Bilbo  was  going  to  be \\neleventy-one,  ill,  a  rather  curious  number,  and  a  very  re¬ \\nspectable  age  for  a  hobbit  (the  Old  Took  himself  had  only \\nreached  130);  and  Frodo  was  going  to  be  thirty-three,  33,  an \\nimportant  number:  the  date  of  his  ‘coming  of  age’. \\n\\nTongues  began  to  wag  in  Hobbiton  and  Bywater;  and \\nrumour  of  the  coming  event  travelled  all  over  the  Shire.  The \\nhistory  and  character  of  Mr.  Bilbo  Baggins  became  once \\nagain  the  chief  topic  of  conversation;  and  the  older  folk \\nsuddenly  found  their  reminiscences  in  welcome  demand. \\n\\nNo  one  had  a  more  attentive  audience  than  old  Flam \\nGamgee,  commonly  known  as  the  Gaffer.  Fie  held  forth  at \\nThe  Ivy  Bush,  a  small  inn  on  the  Bywater  road;  and  he  spoke \\nwith  some  authority,  for  he  had  tended  the  garden  at  Bag \\nEnd  for  forty  years,  and  had  helped  old  Holman  in  the  same \\njob  before  that.  Now  that  he  was  himself  growing  old  and \\nstiff  in  the  joints,  the  job  was  mainly  carried  on  by  his  young¬ \\nest  son,  Sam  Gamgee.  Both  father  and  son  were  on  very \\nfriendly  terms  with  Bilbo  and  Frodo.  They  lived  on  the  Hill \\nitself,  in  Number  3  Bagshot  Row  just  below  Bag  End. \\n\\n‘A  very  nice  well-spoken  gentlehobbit  is  Mr.  Bilbo,  as  I’ve \\nalways  said,’  the  Gaffer  declared.  With  perfect  truth:  for  Bilbo \\nwas  very  polite  to  him,  calling  him  ‘Master  Hamfast’,  and \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY \\n\\n\\n29 \\n\\n\\nconsulting  him  constantly  upon  the  growing  of  vegetables  - \\nin  the  matter  of  ‘roots’,  especially  potatoes,  the  Gaffer  was \\nrecognized  as  the  leading  authority  by  all  in  the  neighbour¬ \\nhood  (including  himself) . \\n\\n‘But  what  about  this  Frodo  that  lives  with  him?’  asked  Old \\nNoakes  of  Bywater.  ‘Baggins  is  his  name,  but  he’s  more  than \\nhalf  a  Brandybuck,  they  say.  It  beats  me  why  any  Baggins \\nof  Hobbiton  should  go  looking  for  a  wife  away  there  in \\nBuckland,  where  folks  are  so  queer.’ \\n\\n‘And  no  wonder  they’re  queer,’  put  in  Daddy  Twofoot \\n(the  Gaffer’s  next-door  neighbour),  ‘if  they  live  on  the  wrong \\nside  of  the  Brandywine  River,  and  right  agin  the  Old  Forest. \\nThat’s  a  dark  bad  place,  if  half  the  tales  be  true.’ \\n\\n‘You’re  right,  Dad!’  said  the  Gaffer.  ‘Not  that  the  Brandy- \\nbucks  of  Buckland  live  in  the  Old  Forest;  but  they’re  a  queer \\nbreed,  seemingly.  They  fool  about  with  boats  on  that  big \\nriver  -  and  that  isn’t  natural.  Small  wonder  that  trouble  came \\nof  it,  I  say.  But  be  that  as  it  may,  Mr.  Frodo  is  as  nice  a \\nyoung  hobbit  as  you  could  wish  to  meet.  Very  much  like \\nMr.  Bilbo,  and  in  more  than  looks.  After  all  his  father  was \\na  Baggins.  A  decent  respectable  hobbit  was  Mr.  Drogo \\nBaggins;  there  was  never  much  to  tell  of  him,  till  he  was \\ndrownded.’ \\n\\n‘Drownded?’  said  several  voices.  They  had  heard  this  and \\nother  darker  rumours  before,  of  course;  but  hobbits  have  a \\npassion  for  family  history,  and  they  were  ready  to  hear  it \\nagain. \\n\\n‘Well,  so  they  say,’  said  the  Gaffer.  ‘You  see:  Mr.  Drogo, \\nhe  married  poor  Miss  Primula  Brandybuck.  She  was  our  Mr. \\nBilbo’s  first  cousin  on  the  mother’s  side  (her  mother  being \\nthe  youngest  of  the  Old  Took’s  daughters);  and  Mr.  Drogo \\nwas  his  second  cousin.  So  Mr.  Frodo  is  his  first  and  second \\ncousin,  once  removed  either  way,  as  the  saying  is,  if  you \\nfollow  me.  And  Mr.  Drogo  was  staying  at  Brandy  Hall  with \\nhis  father-in-law,  old  Master  Gorbadoc,  as  he  often  did \\nafter  his  marriage  (him  being  partial  to  his  vittles,  and  old \\nGorbadoc  keeping  a  mighty  generous  table) ;  and  he  went  out \\n\\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nboating  on  the  Brandywine  River;  and  he  and  his  wife  were \\ndrownded,  and  poor  Mr.  Frodo  only  a  child  and  all.’ \\n\\n‘I’ve  heard  they  went  on  the  water  after  dinner  in  the \\nmoonlight,’  said  Old  Noakes;  ‘and  it  was  Drogo’s  weight  as \\nsunk  the  boat.’ \\n\\n‘And  /  heard  she  pushed  him  in,  and  he  pulled  her  in  after \\nhim,’  said  Sandyman,  the  Hobbiton  miller. \\n\\n‘You  shouldn’t  listen  to  all  you  hear,  Sandyman,’  said  the \\nGaffer,  who  did  not  much  like  the  miller.  ‘There  isn’t  no  call \\nto  go  talking  of  pushing  and  pulling.  Boats  are  quite  tricky \\nenough  for  those  that  sit  still  without  looking  further  for  the \\ncause  of  trouble.  Anyway:  there  was  this  Mr.  Frodo  left  an \\norphan  and  stranded,  as  you  might  say,  among  those  queer \\nBucklanders,  being  brought  up  anyhow  in  Brandy  Hall.  A \\nregular  warren,  by  all  accounts.  Old  Master  Gorbadoc  never \\nhad  fewer  than  a  couple  of  hundred  relations  in  the  place. \\nMr.  Bilbo  never  did  a  kinder  deed  than  when  he  brought  the \\nlad  back  to  live  among  decent  folk. \\n\\n‘But  I  reckon  it  was  a  nasty  knock  for  those  Sackville- \\nBagginses.  They  thought  they  were  going  to  get  Bag  End, \\nthat  time  when  he  went  off  and  was  thought  to  be  dead.  And \\nthen  he  comes  back  and  orders  them  off;  and  he  goes  on \\nliving  and  living,  and  never  looking  a  day  older,  bless  him! \\nAnd  suddenly  he  produces  an  heir,  and  has  all  the  papers \\nmade  out  proper.  The  Sackville-Bagginses  won’t  never  see \\nthe  inside  of  Bag  End  now,  or  it  is  to  be  hoped  not.’ \\n\\n‘There’s  a  tidy  bit  of  money  tucked  away  up  there,  I  hear \\ntell,’  said  a  stranger,  a  visitor  on  business  from  Michel \\nDelving  in  the  Westfarthing.  ‘All  the  top  of  your  hill  is  full  of \\ntunnels  packed  with  chests  of  gold  and  silver,  and  jools,  by \\nwhat  I’ve  heard.’ \\n\\n‘Then  you’ve  heard  more  than  I  can  speak  to,’  answered \\nthe  Gaffer.  ‘I  know  nothing  about  jools.  Mr.  Bilbo  is  free  with \\nhis  money,  and  there  seems  no  lack  of  it;  but  I  know  of  no \\ntunnel-making.  I  saw  Mr.  Bilbo  when  he  came  back,  a  matter \\nof  sixty  years  ago,  when  I  was  a  lad.  I’d  not  long  come \\nprentice  to  old  Holman  (him  being  my  dad’s  cousin),  but  he \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY \\n\\n\\n31 \\n\\n\\nhad  me  up  at  Bag  End  helping  him  to  keep  folks  from  tram¬ \\npling  and  trapessing  all  over  the  garden  while  the  sale  was \\non.  And  in  the  middle  of  it  all  Mr.  Bilbo  comes  up  the  Hill \\nwith  a  pony  and  some  mighty  big  bags  and  a  couple  of  chests. \\nI  don’t  doubt  they  were  mostly  full  of  treasure  he  had  picked \\nup  in  foreign  parts,  where  there  be  mountains  of  gold,  they \\nsay;  but  there  wasn’t  enough  to  fill  tunnels.  But  my  lad  Sam \\nwill  know  more  about  that.  He’s  in  and  out  of  Bag  End. \\nCrazy  about  stories  of  the  old  days,  he  is,  and  he  listens  to \\nall  Mr.  Bilbo’s  tales.  Mr.  Bilbo  has  learned  him  his  letters  - \\nmeaning  no  harm,  mark  you,  and  I  hope  no  harm  will  come \\nof  it. \\n\\n‘ Elves  and  Dragons!  I  says  to  him.  Cabbages  and  potatoes  are \\nbetter  for  me  and  yon.  Don’t  go  getting  mixed  up  in  the  business \\nof  your  betters,  or  you’ll  land  in  trouble  too  big  for  you,  I  says  to \\nhim.  And  I  might  say  it  to  others,’  he  added  with  a  look  at \\nthe  stranger  and  the  miller. \\n\\nBut  the  Gaffer  did  not  convince  his  audience.  The  legend \\nof  Bilbo’s  wealth  was  now  too  firmly  fixed  in  the  minds  of \\nthe  younger  generation  of  hobbits. \\n\\n‘Ah,  but  he  has  likely  enough  been  adding  to  what  he \\nbrought  at  first,’  argued  the  miller,  voicing  common  opinion. \\n‘He’s  often  away  from  home.  And  look  at  the  outlandish  folk \\nthat  visit  him:  dwarves  coming  at  night,  and  that  old  wandering \\nconjuror,  Gandalf,  and  all.  You  can  say  what  you  like,  Gaffer, \\nbut  Bag  End’s  a  queer  place,  and  its  folk  are  queerer.’ \\n\\n‘And  you  can  say  what  you  like,  about  what  you  know  no \\nmore  of  than  you  do  of  boating,  Mr.  Sandyman,’  retorted \\nthe  Gaffer,  disliking  the  miller  even  more  than  usual.  ‘If  that’s \\nbeing  queer,  then  we  could  do  with  a  bit  more  queerness  in \\nthese  parts.  There’s  some  not  far  away  that  wouldn’t  offer  a \\npint  of  beer  to  a  friend,  if  they  lived  in  a  hole  with  golden \\nwalls.  But  they  do  things  proper  at  Bag  End.  Our  Sam  says \\nthat  everyone’s  going  to  be  invited  to  the  party,  and  there’s \\ngoing  to  be  presents,  mark  you,  presents  for  all  -  this  very \\nmonth  as  is.’ \\n\\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nThat  very  month  was  September,  and  as  fine  as  you  could \\nask.  A  day  or  two  later  a  rumour  (probably  started  by  the \\nknowledgeable  Sam)  was  spread  about  that  there  were  going \\nto  be  fireworks  -  fireworks,  what  is  more,  such  as  had  not \\nbeen  seen  in  the  Shire  for  nigh  on  a  century,  not  indeed  since \\nthe  Old  Took  died. \\n\\nDays  passed  and  The  Day  drew  nearer.  An  odd-looking \\nwaggon  laden  with  odd-looking  packages  rolled  into  Hobbi- \\nton  one  evening  and  toiled  up  the  Hill  to  Bag  End.  The \\nstartled  hobbits  peered  out  of  lamplit  doors  to  gape  at  it.  It \\nwas  driven  by  outlandish  folk,  singing  strange  songs:  dwarves \\nwith  long  beards  and  deep  hoods.  A  few  of  them  remained \\nat  Bag  End.  At  the  end  of  the  second  week  in  September  a \\ncart  came  in  through  Bywater  from  the  direction  of  Brandy¬ \\nwine  Bridge  in  broad  daylight.  An  old  man  was  driving  it  all \\nalone.  He  wore  a  tall  pointed  blue  hat,  a  long  grey  cloak,  and \\na  silver  scarf.  He  had  a  long  white  beard  and  bushy  eyebrows \\nthat  stuck  out  beyond  the  brim  of  his  hat.  Small  hobbit- \\nchildren  ran  after  the  cart  all  through  Hobbiton  and  right  up \\nthe  hill.  It  had  a  cargo  of  fireworks,  as  they  rightly  guessed. \\nAt  Bilbo’s  front  door  the  old  man  began  to  unload:  there \\nwere  great  bundles  of  fireworks  of  all  sorts  and  shapes,  each \\nlabelled  with  a  large  red  G  ^  and  the  elf-rune,  JJ&gt;! \\n\\nThat  was  Gandalf’s  mark,  of  course,  and  the  old  man \\nwas  Gandalf  the  Wizard,  whose  fame  in  the  Shire  was  due \\nmainly  to  his  skill  with  fires,  smokes,  and  lights.  His  real \\nbusiness  was  far  more  difficult  and  dangerous,  but  the \\nShire -folk  knew  nothing  about  it.  To  them  he  was  just  one \\nof  the  ‘attractions’  at  the  Party.  Hence  the  excitement  of \\nthe  hobbit-children.  ‘G  for  Grand!’  they  shouted,  and  the \\nold  man  smiled.  They  knew  him  by  sight,  though  he  only \\nappeared  in  Hobbiton  occasionally  and  never  stopped  long; \\nbut  neither  they  nor  any  but  the  oldest  of  their  elders  had \\nseen  one  of  his  firework  displays  -  they  now  belonged  to  a \\nlegendary  past. \\n\\nWhen  the  old  man,  helped  by  Bilbo  and  some  dwarves, \\nhad  finished  unloading,  Bilbo  gave  a  few  pennies  away;  but \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY  33 \\n\\nnot  a  single  squib  or  cracker  was  forthcoming,  to  the  dis¬ \\nappointment  of  the  onlookers. \\n\\n‘Run  away  now!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘You  will  get  plenty  when \\nthe  time  comes.’  Then  he  disappeared  inside  with  Bilbo,  and \\nthe  door  was  shut.  The  young  hobbits  stared  at  the  door  in \\nvain  for  a  while,  and  then  made  off,  feeling  that  the  day  of \\nthe  party  would  never  come. \\n\\nInside  Bag  End,  Bilbo  and  Gandalf  were  sitting  at  the  open \\nwindow  of  a  small  room  looking  out  west  on  to  the  garden. \\nThe  late  afternoon  was  bright  and  peaceful.  The  flowers \\nglowed  red  and  golden:  snap-dragons  and  sunflowers,  and \\nnasturtians  trailing  all  over  the  turf  walls  and  peeping  in  at \\nthe  round  windows. \\n\\n‘How  bright  your  garden  looks!’  said  Gandalf. \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘I  am  very  fond  indeed  of  it,  and  of  all \\nthe  dear  old  Shire;  but  I  think  I  need  a  holiday.’ \\n\\n‘You  mean  to  go  on  with  your  plan  then?’ \\n\\n‘I  do.  I  made  up  my  mind  months  ago,  and  I  haven’t \\nchanged  it.  ’ \\n\\n‘Very  well.  It  is  no  good  saying  any  more.  Stick  to  your \\nplan  -  your  whole  plan,  mind  -  and  I  hope  it  will  turn  out \\nfor  the  best,  for  you,  and  for  all  of  us.’ \\n\\n‘I  hope  so.  Anyway  I  mean  to  enjoy  myself  on  Thursday, \\nand  have  my  little  joke.’ \\n\\n‘Who  will  laugh,  I  wonder?’  said  Gandalf,  shaking  his  head. \\n\\n‘We  shall  see,’  said  Bilbo. \\n\\nThe  next  day  more  carts  rolled  up  the  Hill,  and  still  more \\ncarts.  There  might  have  been  some  grumbling  about  ‘dealing \\nlocally’,  but  that  very  week  orders  began  to  pour  out  of  Bag \\nEnd  for  every  kind  of  provision,  commodity,  or  luxury  that \\ncould  be  obtained  in  Hobbiton  or  Bywater  or  anywhere  in \\nthe  neighbourhood.  People  became  enthusiastic;  and  they \\nbegan  to  tick  off  the  days  on  the  calendar;  and  they  watched \\neagerly  for  the  postman,  hoping  for  invitations. \\n\\nBefore  long  the  invitations  began  pouring  out,  and  the \\n\\n\\n34 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nHobbiton  post-office  was  blocked,  and  the  Bywater  post- \\noffice  was  snowed  under,  and  voluntary  assistant  postmen \\nwere  called  for.  There  was  a  constant  stream  of  them  going \\nup  the  Hill,  carrying  hundreds  of  polite  variations  on  Thank \\nyou,  I  shall  certainly  come. \\n\\nA  notice  appeared  on  the  gate  at  Bag  End:  no  admit¬ \\ntance  except  on  party  business.  Even  those  who  had, \\nor  pretended  to  have  Party  Business  were  seldom  allowed \\ninside.  Bilbo  was  busy:  writing  invitations,  ticking  off \\nanswers,  packing  up  presents,  and  making  some  private \\npreparations  of  his  own.  From  the  time  of  Gandalf ’s  arrival \\nhe  remained  hidden  from  view. \\n\\nOne  morning  the  hobbits  woke  to  find  the  large  field,  south \\nof  Bilbo’s  front  door,  covered  with  ropes  and  poles  for  tents \\nand  pavilions.  A  special  entrance  was  cut  into  the  bank \\nleading  to  the  road,  and  wide  steps  and  a  large  white  gate \\nwere  built  there.  The  three  hobbit-families  of  Bagshot  Row, \\nadjoining  the  field,  were  intensely  interested  and  generally \\nenvied.  Old  Gaffer  Gamgee  stopped  even  pretending  to  work \\nin  his  garden. \\n\\nThe  tents  began  to  go  up.  There  was  a  specially  large \\npavilion,  so  big  that  the  tree  that  grew  in  the  field  was  right \\ninside  it,  and  stood  proudly  near  one  end,  at  the  head  of \\nthe  chief  table.  Lanterns  were  hung  on  all  its  branches. \\nMore  promising  still  (to  the  hobbits’  mind):  an  enormous \\nopen-air  kitchen  was  erected  in  the  north  corner  of  the  field. \\nA  draught  of  cooks,  from  every  inn  and  eating-house  for \\nmiles  around,  arrived  to  supplement  the  dwarves  and  other \\nodd  folic  that  were  quartered  at  Bag  End.  Excitement  rose  to \\nits  height. \\n\\nThen  the  weather  clouded  over.  That  was  on  Wednesday \\nthe  eve  of  the  Party.  Anxiety  was  intense.  Then  Thursday, \\nSeptember  the  22nd,  actually  dawned.  The  sun  got  up,  the \\nclouds  vanished,  flags  were  unfurled  and  the  fun  began. \\n\\nBilbo  Baggins  called  it  a  party,  but  it  was  really  a  variety \\nof  entertainments  rolled  into  one.  Practically  everybody  living \\nnear  was  invited.  A  very  few  were  overlooked  by  accident, \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY \\n\\n\\n35 \\n\\n\\nbut  as  they  turned  up  all  the  same,  that  did  not  matter.  Many \\npeople  from  other  parts  of  the  Shire  were  also  asked;  and \\nthere  were  even  a  few  from  outside  the  borders.  Bilbo  met \\nthe  guests  (and  additions)  at  the  new  white  gate  in  person. \\nHe  gave  away  presents  to  all  and  sundry  -  the  latter  were \\nthose  who  went  out  again  by  a  back  way  and  came  in  again \\nby  the  gate.  Hobbits  give  presents  to  other  people  on  their \\nown  birthdays.  Not  very  expensive  ones,  as  a  rule,  and  not \\nso  lavishly  as  on  this  occasion;  but  it  was  not  a  bad  system. \\nActually  in  Hobbiton  and  Bywater  every  day  in  the  year  was \\nsomebody’s  birthday,  so  that  every  hobbit  in  those  parts  had \\na  fair  chance  of  at  least  one  present  at  least  once  a  week.  But \\nthey  never  got  tired  of  them. \\n\\nOn  this  occasion  the  presents  were  unusually  good.  The \\nhobbit-children  were  so  excited  that  for  a  while  they  almost \\nforgot  about  eating.  There  were  toys  the  like  of  which  they \\nhad  never  seen  before,  all  beautiful  and  some  obviously  magi¬ \\ncal.  Many  of  them  had  indeed  been  ordered  a  year  before, \\nand  had  come  all  the  way  from  the  Mountain  and  from  Dale, \\nand  were  of  real  dwarf-make. \\n\\nWhen  every  guest  had  been  welcomed  and  was  finally \\ninside  the  gate,  there  were  songs,  dances,  music,  games,  and, \\nof  course,  food  and  drink.  There  were  three  official  meals: \\nlunch,  tea,  and  dinner  (or  supper) .  But  lunch  and  tea  were \\nmarked  chiefly  by  the  fact  that  at  those  times  all  the  guests \\nwere  sitting  down  and  eating  together.  At  other  times  there \\nwere  merely  lots  of  people  eating  and  drinking  -  continuously \\nfrom  elevenses  until  six -thirty,  when  the  fireworks  started. \\n\\nThe  fireworks  were  by  Gandalf:  they  were  not  only  brought \\nby  him,  but  designed  and  made  by  him;  and  the  special \\neffects,  set  pieces,  and  flights  of  rockets  were  let  off  by \\nhim.  But  there  was  also  a  generous  distribution  of  squibs, \\ncrackers,  backarappers,  sparklers,  torches,  dwarf-candles,  elf- \\nfountains,  goblin-barkers  and  thunder-claps.  They  were  all \\nsuperb.  The  art  of  Gandalf  improved  with  age. \\n\\nThere  were  rockets  like  a  flight  of  scintillating  birds  singing \\nwith  sweet  voices.  There  were  green  trees  with  trunks  of  dark \\n\\n\\n36 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nsmoke:  their  leaves  opened  like  a  whole  spring  unfolding  in  a \\nmoment,  and  their  shining  branches  dropped  glowing  flowers \\ndown  upon  the  astonished  hobbits,  disappearing  with  a  sweet \\nscent  just  before  they  touched  their  upturned  faces.  There \\nwere  fountains  of  butterflies  that  flew  glittering  into  the  trees; \\nthere  were  pillars  of  coloured  fires  that  rose  and  turned  into \\neagles,  or  sailing  ships,  or  a  phalanx  of  flying  swans;  there \\nwas  a  red  thunderstorm  and  a  shower  of  yellow  rain;  there \\nwas  a  forest  of  silver  spears  that  sprang  suddenly  into  the  air \\nwith  a  yell  like  an  embattled  army,  and  came  down  again  into \\nthe  Water  with  a  hiss  like  a  hundred  hot  snakes.  And  there \\nwas  also  one  last  surprise,  in  honour  of  Bilbo,  and  it  startled \\nthe  hobbits  exceedingly,  as  Gandalf  intended.  The  lights  went \\nout.  A  great  smoke  went  up.  It  shaped  itself  like  a  mountain \\nseen  in  the  distance,  and  began  to  glow  at  the  summit.  It \\nspouted  green  and  scarlet  flames.  Out  flew  a  red-golden \\ndragon  -  not  life-size,  but  terribly  life-like:  fire  came  from  his \\njaws,  his  eyes  glared  down;  there  was  a  roar,  and  he  whizzed \\nthree  times  over  the  heads  of  the  crowd.  They  all  ducked, \\nand  many  fell  flat  on  their  faces.  The  dragon  passed  like  an \\nexpress  train,  turned  a  somersault,  and  burst  over  Bywater \\nwith  a  deafening  explosion. \\n\\n‘That  is  the  signal  for  supper!’  said  Bilbo.  The  pain  and \\nalarm  vanished  at  once,  and  the  prostrate  hobbits  leaped  to \\ntheir  feet.  There  was  a  splendid  supper  for  everyone;  for \\neveryone,  that  is,  except  those  invited  to  the  special  family \\ndinner-party.  This  was  held  in  the  great  pavilion  with  the \\ntree.  The  invitations  were  limited  to  twelve  dozen  (a  number \\nalso  called  by  the  hobbits  one  Gross,  though  the  word  was \\nnot  considered  proper  to  use  of  people);  and  the  guests  were \\nselected  from  all  the  families  to  which  Bilbo  and  Frodo  were \\nrelated,  with  the  addition  of  a  few  special  unrelated  friends \\n(such  as  Gandalf) .  Many  young  hobbits  were  included,  and \\npresent  by  parental  permission;  for  hobbits  were  easy-going \\nwith  their  children  in  the  matter  of  sitting  up  late,  especially \\nwhen  there  was  a  chance  of  getting  them  a  free  meal.  Bringing \\nup  young  hobbits  took  a  lot  of  provender. \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY \\n\\n\\n37 \\n\\n\\nThere  were  many  Bagginses  and  Boffins,  and  also  many \\nTooks  and  Brandybucks;  there  were  various  Grubbs  (re¬ \\nlations  of  Bilbo  Baggins’  grandmother),  and  various  Chubbs \\n(connexions  of  his  Took  grandfather);  and  a  selection  of \\nBurrowses,  Bolgers,  Bracegirdles,  Brockhouses,  Goodbodies, \\nHornblowers  and  Proudfoots.  Some  of  these  were  only  very \\ndistantly  connected  with  Bilbo,  and  some  had  hardly  ever \\nbeen  in  Hobbiton  before,  as  they  lived  in  remote  corners  of \\nthe  Shire.  The  Sackville -Bagginses  were  not  forgotten.  Otho \\nand  his  wife  Lobelia  were  present.  They  disliked  Bilbo  and \\ndetested  Frodo,  but  so  magnificent  was  the  invitation  card, \\nwritten  in  golden  ink,  that  they  had  felt  it  was  impossible  to \\nrefuse.  Besides,  their  cousin,  Bilbo,  had  been  specializing  in \\nfood  for  many  years  and  his  table  had  a  high  reputation. \\n\\nAll  the  one  hundred  and  forty-four  guests  expected  a  pleas¬ \\nant  feast;  though  they  rather  dreaded  the  after-dinner  speech \\nof  their  host  (an  inevitable  item) .  He  was  liable  to  drag  in  bits \\nof  what  he  called  poetry;  and  sometimes,  after  a  glass  or \\ntwo,  would  allude  to  the  absurd  adventures  of  his  mysterious \\njourney.  The  guests  were  not  disappointed:  they  had  a  very \\npleasant  feast,  in  fact  an  engrossing  entertainment:  rich, \\nabundant,  varied,  and  prolonged.  The  purchase  of  provisions \\nfell  almost  to  nothing  throughout  the  district  in  the  ensuing \\nweeks;  but  as  Bilbo’s  catering  had  depleted  the  stocks  of  most \\nof  the  stores,  cellars  and  warehouses  for  miles  around,  that \\ndid  not  matter  much. \\n\\nAfter  the  feast  (more  or  less)  came  the  Speech.  Most  of \\nthe  company  were,  however,  now  in  a  tolerant  mood,  at  that \\ndelightful  stage  which  they  called  ‘filling  up  the  corners’. \\nThey  were  sipping  their  favourite  drinks,  and  nibbling  at  their \\nfavourite  dainties,  and  their  fears  were  forgotten.  They  were \\nprepared  to  listen  to  anything,  and  to  cheer  at  every  full  stop. \\n\\nMy  dear  People ,  began  Bilbo,  rising  in  his  place.  ‘Hear! \\nHear!  Hear!’  they  shouted,  and  kept  on  repeating  it  in  chorus, \\nseeming  reluctant  to  follow  their  own  advice.  Bilbo  left  his \\nplace  and  went  and  stood  on  a  chair  under  the  illuminated \\ntree.  The  light  of  the  lanterns  fell  on  his  beaming  face;  the \\n\\n\\n38 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\ngolden  buttons  shone  on  his  embroidered  silk  waistcoat.  They \\ncould  all  see  him  standing,  waving  one  hand  in  the  air,  the \\nother  was  in  his  trouser-pocket. \\n\\nMy  dear  Bagginses  and  Boffins ,  he  began  again;  and  my \\ndear  Books  and  Brandybucks,  and  Grubbs,  and  Chubbs,  and \\nBurrowses,  and  Hornblowers,  and  Bolgers,  Bracegirdles,  Good- \\nbodies,  Brockhouses  and  Proudfoots.  ‘ProudFEETl’  shouted  an \\nelderly  hobbit  from  the  back  of  the  pavilion.  His  name,  of \\ncourse,  was  Proudfoot,  and  well  merited;  his  feet  were  large, \\nexceptionally  furry,  and  both  were  on  the  table. \\n\\nProudfoots,  repeated  Bilbo.  Also  my  good  Sackville-Bagginses \\nthat  I  welcome  back  at  last  to  Bag  End.  Today  is  my  one  hundred \\nand  eleventh  birthday:  I  am  eleventy-one  today!  ‘Hurray!  Hur¬ \\nray!  Many  Happy  Returns!’  they  shouted,  and  they  ham¬ \\nmered  joyously  on  the  tables.  Bilbo  was  doing  splendidly. \\nThis  was  the  sort  of  stuff  they  liked:  short  and  obvious. \\n\\nI  hope  you  are  all  enjoying  yourselves  as  much  as  I  am.  Deaf¬ \\nening  cheers.  Cries  of  Yes  (and  No).  Noises  of  trumpets  and \\nhorns,  pipes  and  flutes,  and  other  musical  instruments.  There \\nwere,  as  has  been  said,  many  young  hobbits  present.  Hun¬ \\ndreds  of  musical  crackers  had  been  pulled.  Most  of  them \\nbore  the  mark  dale  on  them;  which  did  not  convey  much  to \\nmost  of  the  hobbits,  but  they  all  agreed  they  were  marvellous \\ncrackers.  They  contained  instruments,  small,  but  of  perfect \\nmake  and  enchanting  tones.  Indeed,  in  one  corner  some  of \\nthe  young  Tooks  and  Brandybucks,  supposing  Uncle  Bilbo \\nto  have  finished  (since  he  had  plainly  said  all  that  was  neces¬ \\nsary),  now  got  up  an  impromptu  orchestra,  and  began  a \\nmerry  dance-tune.  Master  Everard  Took  and  Miss  Melilot \\nBrandybuck  got  on  a  table  and  with  bells  in  their  hands \\nbegan  to  dance  the  Springle-ring:  a  pretty  dance,  but  rather \\nvigorous. \\n\\nBut  Bilbo  had  not  finished.  Seizing  a  horn  from  a  youngster \\nnearby,  he  blew  three  loud  hoots.  The  noise  subsided.  I  shall \\nnot  keep  you  long,  he  cried.  Cheers  from  all  the  assembly.  / \\nhave  called  you  all  together  for  a  Purpose.  Something  in  the \\nway  that  he  said  this  made  an  impression.  There  was  almost \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY \\n\\n\\n39 \\n\\n\\nsilence,  and  one  or  two  of  the  Tooks  pricked  up  their  ears. \\n\\nIndeed,  for  Three  Purposes!  First  of  all,  to  tell  you  that  I  am \\nimmensely  fond  of  you  all,  and  that  eleventy-one  years  is  too \\nshort  a  time  to  live  among  such  excellent  and  admirable  hobbits. \\nTremendous  outburst  of  approval. \\n\\nI  don’t  know  half  of  you  half  as  well  as  I  should  like;  and  I \\nlike  less  than  half  of  you  half  as  well  as  you  deserve.  This  was \\nunexpected  and  rather  difficult.  There  was  some  scattered \\nclapping,  but  most  of  them  were  trying  to  work  it  out  and \\nsee  if  it  came  to  a  compliment. \\n\\nSecondly,  to  celebrate  my  birthday.  Cheers  again.  I  should \\nsay:  OUR  birthday.  For  it  is,  of  course,  also  the  birthday  of  my \\nheir  and  nephew,  Frodo.  He  comes  of  age  and  into  his  inheritance \\ntoday.  Some  perfunctory  clapping  by  the  elders;  and  some \\nloud  shouts  of  ‘Frodo!  Frodo!  Jolly  old  Frodo,’  from  the \\njuniors.  The  Sackville-Bagginses  scowled,  and  wondered \\nwhat  was  meant  by  ‘coming  into  his  inheritance’. \\n\\nTogether  we  score  one  hundred  and  forty-four.  Your  numbers \\nwere  chosen  to  fit  this  remarkable  total:  One  Gross,  if  I  may  use \\nthe  expression.  No  cheers.  This  was  ridiculous.  Many  of  the \\nguests,  and  especially  the  Sackville-Bagginses,  were  insulted, \\nfeeling  sure  they  had  only  been  asked  to  fill  up  the  required \\nnumber,  like  goods  in  a  package.  ‘One  Gross,  indeed!  Vulgar \\nexpression.’ \\n\\nIt  is  also,  if  I  may  be  allowed  to  refer  to  ancient  history,  the \\nanniversary  of  my  arrival  by  barrel  at  Esgaroth  on  the  Long \\nLake;  though  the  fact  that  it  was  my  birthday  slipped  my  memory \\non  that  occasion.  I  was  only  fifty -one  then,  and  birthdays  did  not \\nseem  so  important.  The  banquet  was  very  splendid,  however, \\nthough  I  had  a  bad  cold  at  the  time,  I  remember,  and  could  only \\nsay  ‘thag you  very  buch’.  I  now  repeat  it  more  correctly:  Thank \\nyou  very  much  for  coming  to  my  little  party.  Obstinate  silence. \\nThey  all  feared  that  a  song  or  some  poetry  was  now  immi¬ \\nnent;  and  they  were  getting  bored.  Why  couldn’t  he  stop \\ntalking  and  let  them  drink  his  health?  But  Bilbo  did  not  sing \\nor  recite.  He  paused  for  a  moment. \\n\\nThirdly  and  finally,  he  said,  I  wish  to  make  an \\n\\n\\n40 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nANNOUNCEMENT.  He  spoke  this  last  word  so  loudly  and \\nsuddenly  that  everyone  sat  up  who  still  could.  I  regret  to \\nannounce  that  -  though,  as  I  said,  eleventy-one  years  is  far  too \\nshort  a  time  to  spend  among  you  -  this  is  the  END.  I  am  going. \\nIam  leaving  NOW.  GOOD-BYE! \\n\\nHe  stepped  down  and  vanished.  There  was  a  blinding  flash \\nof  light,  and  the  guests  all  blinked.  When  they  opened  their \\neyes  Bilbo  was  nowhere  to  be  seen.  One  hundred  and  forty- \\nfour  flabbergasted  hobbits  sat  back  speechless.  Old  Odo \\nProudfoot  removed  his  feet  from  the  table  and  stamped. \\nThen  there  was  a  dead  silence,  until  suddenly,  after  several \\ndeep  breaths,  every  Baggins,  Boffin,  Took,  Brandybuck, \\nGrubb,  Chubb,  Burrows,  Bolger,  Bracegirdle,  Brockhouse, \\nGoodbody,  Hornblower,  and  Proudfoot  began  to  talk  at  once. \\n\\nIt  was  generally  agreed  that  the  joke  was  in  very  bad  taste, \\nand  more  food  and  drink  were  needed  to  cure  the  guests  of \\nshock  and  annoyance.  ‘He’s  mad.  I  always  said  so,’  was \\nprobably  the  most  popular  comment.  Even  the  Tooks  (with \\na  few  exceptions)  thought  Bilbo’s  behaviour  was  absurd.  For \\nthe  moment  most  of  them  took  it  for  granted  that  his \\ndisappearance  was  nothing  more  than  a  ridiculous  prank. \\n\\nBut  old  Rory  Brandybuck  was  not  so  sure.  Neither  age  nor \\nan  enormous  dinner  had  clouded  his  wits,  and  he  said  to  his \\ndaughter-in-law,  Esmeralda:  ‘There’s  something  fishy  in  this, \\nmy  dear!  I  believe  that  mad  Baggins  is  off  again.  Silly  old \\nfool.  But  why  worry?  He  hasn’t  taken  the  vittles  with  him.’ \\nHe  called  loudly  to  Frodo  to  send  the  wine  round  again. \\n\\nFrodo  was  the  only  one  present  who  had  said  nothing.  For \\nsome  time  he  had  sat  silent  beside  Bilbo’s  empty  chair,  and \\nignored  all  remarks  and  questions.  He  had  enjoyed  the  joke, \\nof  course,  even  though  he  had  been  in  the  know.  He  had \\ndifficulty  in  keeping  from  laughter  at  the  indignant  surprise \\nof  the  guests.  But  at  the  same  time  he  felt  deeply  troubled: \\nhe  realized  suddenly  that  he  loved  the  old  hobbit  dearly.  Most \\nof  the  guests  went  on  eating  and  drinking  and  discussing \\nBilbo  Baggins’  oddities,  past  and  present;  but  the  Sackville- \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY \\n\\n\\n41 \\n\\n\\nBagginses  had  already  departed  in  wrath.  Frodo  did  not  want \\nto  have  any  more  to  do  with  the  party.  He  gave  orders  for \\nmore  wine  to  be  served;  then  he  got  up  and  drained  his  own \\nglass  silently  to  the  health  of  Bilbo,  and  slipped  out  of  the \\npavilion. \\n\\nAs  for  Bilbo  Baggins,  even  while  he  was  making  his  speech, \\nhe  had  been  fingering  the  golden  ring  in  his  pocket:  his  magic \\nring  that  he  had  kept  secret  for  so  many  years.  As  he  stepped \\ndown  he  slipped  it  on  his  finger,  and  he  was  never  seen  by \\nany  hobbit  in  Hobbiton  again. \\n\\nHe  walked  briskly  back  to  his  hole,  and  stood  for  a  moment \\nlistening  with  a  smile  to  the  din  in  the  pavilion,  and  to  the \\nsounds  of  merrymaking  in  other  parts  of  the  field.  Then  he \\nwent  in.  He  took  off  his  party  clothes,  folded  up  and  wrapped \\nin  tissue-paper  his  embroidered  silk  waistcoat,  and  put  it \\naway.  Then  he  put  on  quickly  some  old  untidy  garments, \\nand  fastened  round  his  waist  a  worn  leather  belt.  On  it  he \\nhung  a  short  sword  in  a  battered  black-leather  scabbard. \\nFrom  a  locked  drawer,  smelling  of  moth-balls,  he  took \\nout  an  old  cloak  and  hood.  They  had  been  locked  up  as  if \\nthey  were  very  precious,  but  they  were  so  patched  and \\nweatherstained  that  their  original  colour  could  hardly  be \\nguessed:  it  might  have  been  dark  green.  They  were  rather  too \\nlarge  for  him.  He  then  went  into  his  study,  and  from  a  large \\nstrong-box  took  out  a  bundle  wrapped  in  old  cloths,  and  a \\nleather-bound  manuscript;  and  also  a  large  bulky  envelope. \\nThe  book  and  bundle  he  stuffed  into  the  top  of  a  heavy  bag \\nthat  was  standing  there,  already  nearly  full.  Into  the  enve¬ \\nlope  he  slipped  his  golden  ring,  and  its  fine  chain,  and  then \\nsealed  it,  and  addressed  it  to  Frodo.  At  first  he  put  it  on  the \\nmantelpiece,  but  suddenly  he  removed  it  and  stuck  it  in  his \\npocket.  At  that  moment  the  door  opened  and  Gandalf  came \\nquickly  in. \\n\\n‘Hullo!’  said  Bilbo.  ‘I  wondered  if  you  would  turn  up.’ \\n\\n‘I  am  glad  to  find  you  visible,’  replied  the  wizard,  sitting \\ndown  in  a  chair,  ‘I  wanted  to  catch  you  and  have  a  few \\n\\n\\n42 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nfinal  words.  I  suppose  you  feel  that  everything  has  gone  off \\nsplendidly  and  according  to  plan?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  I  do,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘Though  that  flash  was  surprising: \\nit  quite  startled  me,  let  alone  the  others.  A  little  addition  of \\nyour  own,  I  suppose?’ \\n\\n‘It  was.  You  have  wisely  kept  that  ring  secret  all  these  years, \\nand  it  seemed  to  me  necessary  to  give  your  guests  something \\nelse  that  would  seem  to  explain  your  sudden  vanishment.’ \\n\\n‘And  would  spoil  my  joke.  You  are  an  interfering  old  busy¬ \\nbody,’  laughed  Bilbo,  ‘but  I  expect  you  know  best,  as  usual.’ \\n\\n‘I  do  -  when  I  know  anything.  But  I  don’t  feel  too  sure \\nabout  this  whole  affair.  It  has  now  come  to  the  final  point. \\nYou  have  had  your  joke,  and  alarmed  or  offended  most  of \\nyour  relations,  and  given  the  whole  Shire  something  to  talk \\nabout  for  nine  days,  or  ninety-nine  more  likely.  Are  you  going \\nany  further?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  I  am.  I  feel  I  need  a  holiday,  a  very  long  holiday,  as \\nI  have  told  you  before.  Probably  a  permanent  holiday:  I  don’t \\nexpect  I  shall  return.  In  fact,  I  don’t  mean  to,  and  I  have \\nmade  all  arrangements. \\n\\n‘I  am  old,  Gandalf.  I  don’t  look  it,  but  I  am  beginning \\nto  feel  it  in  my  heart  of  hearts.  Well-preserved  indeed!’  he \\nsnorted.  ‘Why,  I  feel  all  thin,  sort  of  stretched ,  if  you  know \\nwhat  I  mean:  like  butter  that  has  been  scraped  over  too  much \\nbread.  That  can’t  be  right.  I  need  a  change,  or  something.’ \\n\\nGandalf  looked  curiously  and  closely  at  him.  ‘No,  it  does \\nnot  seem  right,’  he  said  thoughtfully.  ‘No,  after  all  I  believe \\nyour  plan  is  probably  the  best.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  I’ve  made  up  my  mind,  anyway.  I  want  to  see  moun¬ \\ntains  again,  Gandalf  -  mountains\\',  and  then  find  somewhere \\nwhere  I  can  rest.  In  peace  and  quiet,  without  a  lot  of  relatives \\nprying  around,  and  a  string  of  confounded  visitors  hanging \\non  the  bell.  I  might  find  somewhere  where  I  can  finish  my \\nbook.  I  have  thought  of  a  nice  ending  for  it:  and  he  lived \\nhappily  ever  after  to  the  end  of  his  days’ \\n\\nGandalf  laughed.  ‘I  hope  he  will.  But  nobody  will  read  the \\nbook,  however  it  ends.’ \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY \\n\\n\\n43 \\n\\n\\n‘Oh,  they  may,  in  years  to  come.  Frodo  has  read  some \\nalready,  as  far  as  it  has  gone.  You’ll  keep  an  eye  on  Frodo, \\nwon’t  you?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  I  will  -  two  eyes,  as  often  as  I  can  spare  them.’ \\n\\n‘Fie  would  come  with  me,  of  course,  if  I  asked  him.  In  fact \\nhe  offered  to  once,  just  before  the  party.  But  he  does  not \\nreally  want  to,  yet.  I  want  to  see  the  wild  country  again  before \\nI  die,  and  the  Mountains;  but  he  is  still  in  love  with  the \\nShire,  with  woods  and  fields  and  little  rivers.  He  ought  to  be \\ncomfortable  here.  I  am  leaving  everything  to  him,  of  course, \\nexcept  a  few  oddments.  I  hope  he  will  be  happy,  when  he \\ngets  used  to  being  on  his  own.  It’s  time  he  was  his  own  master \\nnow.’ \\n\\n‘Everything?’  said  Gandalf.  ‘The  ring  as  well?  You  agreed \\nto  that,  you  remember.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  er,  yes,  I  suppose  so,’  stammered  Bilbo. \\n\\nWhere  is  it?’ \\n\\n‘In  an  envelope,  if  you  must  know,’  said  Bilbo  impatiently. \\n‘There  on  the  mantelpiece.  Well,  no!  Here  it  is  in  my \\npocket!’  He  hesitated.  ‘Isn’t  that  odd  now?’  he  said  softly \\nto  himself.  ‘Yet  after  all,  why  not?  Why  shouldn’t  it  stay \\nthere?’ \\n\\nGandalf  looked  again  very  hard  at  Bilbo,  and  there  was  a \\ngleam  in  his  eyes.  ‘I  think,  Bilbo,’  he  said  quietly,  ‘I  should \\nleave  it  behind.  Don’t  you  want  to?’ \\n\\nWell  yes  -  and  no.  Now  it  comes  to  it,  I  don’t  like  parting \\nwith  it  at  all,  I  may  say.  And  I  don’t  really  see  why  I  should. \\nWhy  do  you  want  me  to?’  he  asked,  and  a  curious  change \\ncame  over  his  voice.  It  was  sharp  with  suspicion  and  annoy¬ \\nance.  ‘You  are  always  badgering  me  about  my  ring;  but  you \\nhave  never  bothered  me  about  the  other  things  that  I  got  on \\nmy  journey.’ \\n\\n‘No,  but  I  had  to  badger  you,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘I  wanted  the \\ntruth.  It  was  important.  Magic  rings  are  -  well,  magical;  and \\nthey  are  rare  and  curious.  I  was  professionally  interested  in \\nyour  ring,  you  may  say;  and  I  still  am.  I  should  like  to  know \\nwhere  it  is,  if  you  go  wandering  again.  Also  I  think  you  have \\n\\n\\n44 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nhad  it  quite  long  enough.  You  won’t  need  it  any  more,  Bilbo, \\nunless  I  am  quite  mistaken.’ \\n\\nBilbo  flushed,  and  there  was  an  angry  light  in  his  eyes.  His \\nkindly  face  grew  hard.  ‘Why  not?’  he  cried.  ‘And  what \\nbusiness  is  it  of  yours,  anyway,  to  know  what  I  do  with  my \\nown  things?  It  is  my  own.  I  found  it.  It  came  to  me.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  yes,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘But  there  is  no  need  to  get  angry.’ \\n\\n‘If  I  am  it  is  your  fault,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘It  is  mine,  I  tell  you. \\nMy  own.  My  Precious.  Yes,  my  Precious.’ \\n\\nThe  wizard’s  face  remained  grave  and  attentive,  and  only \\na  flicker  in  his  deep  eyes  showed  that  he  was  startled  and \\nindeed  alarmed.  ‘It  has  been  called  that  before,’  he  said,  ‘but \\nnot  by  you.’ \\n\\n‘But  I  say  it  now.  And  why  not?  Even  if  Gollum  said  the \\nsame  once.  It’s  not  his  now,  but  mine.  And  I  shall  keep  it,  I \\nsay.’ \\n\\nGandalf  stood  up.  He  spoke  sternly.  ‘You  will  be  a  fool  if \\nyou  do,  Bilbo,’  he  said.  ‘You  make  that  clearer  with  every \\nword  you  say.  It  has  got  far  too  much  hold  on  you.  Let  it  go! \\nAnd  then  you  can  go  yourself,  and  be  free.’ \\n\\n‘I’ll  do  as  I  choose  and  go  as  I  please,’  said  Bilbo  obstinately. \\n\\n‘Now,  now,  my  dear  hobbit!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘All  your  long \\nlife  we  have  been  friends,  and  you  owe  me  something.  Come! \\nDo  as  you  promised:  give  it  up!’ \\n\\n‘Well,  if  you  want  my  ring  yourself,  say  so!’  cried  Bilbo. \\n‘But  you  won’t  get  it.  I  won’t  give  my  Precious  away,  I  tell \\nyou.’  His  hand  strayed  to  the  hilt  of  his  small  sword. \\n\\nGandalf’s  eyes  flashed.  ‘It  will  be  my  turn  to  get  angry \\nsoon,’  he  said.  ‘If  you  say  that  again,  I  shall.  Then  you  will \\nsee  Gandalf  the  Grey  uncloaked.’  He  took  a  step  towards  the \\nhobbit,  and  he  seemed  to  grow  tall  and  menacing;  his  shadow \\nfilled  the  little  room. \\n\\nBilbo  backed  away  to  the  wall,  breathing  hard,  his  hand \\nclutching  at  his  pocket.  They  stood  for  a  while  facing  one \\nanother,  and  the  air  of  the  room  tingled.  Gandalf’s  eyes \\nremained  bent  on  the  hobbit.  Slowly  his  hands  relaxed,  and \\nhe  began  to  tremble. \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY \\n\\n\\n45 \\n\\n\\n‘I  don’t  know  what  has  come  over  you,  Gandalf,’  he  said. \\n‘You  have  never  been  like  this  before.  What  is  it  all  about?  It \\nis  mine  isn’t  it?  I  found  it,  and  Gollum  would  have  killed  me, \\nif  I  hadn’t  kept  it.  I’m  not  a  thief,  whatever  he  said.’ \\n\\n‘I  have  never  called  you  one,’  Gandalf  answered.  ‘And  I \\nam  not  one  either.  I  am  not  trying  to  rob  you,  but  to  help \\nyou.  I  wish  you  would  trust  me,  as  you  used.’  He  turned \\naway,  and  the  shadow  passed.  He  seemed  to  dwindle  again \\nto  an  old  grey  man,  bent  and  troubled. \\n\\nBilbo  drew  his  hand  over  his  eyes.  ‘I  am  sorry,’  he  said. \\n‘But  I  felt  so  queer.  And  yet  it  would  be  a  relief  in  a  way  not \\nto  be  bothered  with  it  any  more.  It  has  been  so  growing  on \\nmy  mind  lately.  Sometimes  I  have  felt  it  was  like  an  eye \\nlooking  at  me.  And  I  am  always  wanting  to  put  it  on  and \\ndisappear,  don’t  you  know;  or  wondering  if  it  is  safe,  and \\npulling  it  out  to  make  sure.  I  tried  locking  it  up,  but  I  found \\nI  couldn’t  rest  without  it  in  my  pocket.  I  don’t  know  why. \\nAnd  I  don’t  seem  able  to  make  up  my  mind.’ \\n\\n‘Then  trust  mine,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘It  is  quite  made  up.  Go \\naway  and  leave  it  behind.  Stop  possessing  it.  Give  it  to  Frodo, \\nand  I  will  look  after  him.’ \\n\\nBilbo  stood  for  a  moment  tense  and  undecided.  Presently \\nhe  sighed.  ‘All  right,’  he  said  with  an  effort.  ‘I  will.’  Then  he \\nshrugged  his  shoulders,  and  smiled  rather  ruefully.  ‘After  all \\nthat’s  what  this  party  business  was  all  about,  really:  to  give \\naway  lots  of  birthday-presents,  and  somehow  make  it  easier \\nto  give  it  away  at  the  same  time.  It  hasn’t  made  it  any  easier \\nin  the  end,  but  it  would  be  a  pity  to  waste  all  my  preparations. \\nIt  would  quite  spoil  the  joke.’ \\n\\n‘Indeed  it  would  take  away  the  only  point  I  ever  saw  in  the \\naffair,’  said  Gandalf. \\n\\n‘Very  well,’  said  Bilbo,  ‘it  goes  to  Frodo  with  all  the  rest.’ \\nHe  drew  a  deep  breath.  ‘And  now  I  really  must  be  starting, \\nor  somebody  else  will  catch  me.  I  have  said  good-bye,  and  I \\ncouldn’t  bear  to  do  it  all  over  again.’  He  picked  up  his  bag \\nand  moved  to  the  door. \\n\\n‘You  have  still  got  the  ring  in  your  pocket,’  said  the  wizard. \\n\\n\\n46 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Well,  so  I  have!’  cried  Bilbo.  ‘And  my  will  and  all  the  other \\ndocuments  too.  You  had  better  take  it  and  deliver  it  for  me. \\nThat  will  be  safest.’ \\n\\n‘No,  don’t  give  the  ring  to  me,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Put  it  on  the \\nmantelpiece.  It  will  be  safe  enough  there,  till  Frodo  comes.  I \\nshall  wait  for  him.’ \\n\\nBilbo  took  out  the  envelope,  but  just  as  he  was  about  to  set \\nit  by  the  clock,  his  hand  jerked  back,  and  the  packet  fell  on \\nthe  floor.  Before  he  could  pick  it  up,  the  wizard  stooped  and \\nseized  it  and  set  it  in  its  place.  A  spasm  of  anger  passed \\nswiftly  over  the  hobbit’s  face  again.  Suddenly  it  gave  way  to \\na  look  of  relief  and  a  laugh. \\n\\n‘Well,  that’s  that,’  he  said.  ‘Now  I’m  off!’ \\n\\nThey  went  out  into  the  hall.  Bilbo  chose  his  favourite  stick \\nfrom  the  stand;  then  he  whistled.  Three  dwarves  came  out \\nof  different  rooms  where  they  had  been  busy. \\n\\n‘Is  everything  ready?’  asked  Bilbo.  ‘Everything  packed  and \\nlabelled?’ \\n\\n‘Everything,’  they  answered. \\n\\n‘Well,  let’s  start  then!’  He  stepped  out  of  the  front-door. \\n\\nIt  was  a  fine  night,  and  the  black  sky  was  dotted  with  stars. \\nHe  looked  up,  sniffing  the  air.  What  fun!  What  fun  to  be  off \\nagain,  off  on  the  Road  with  dwarves!  This  is  what  I  have \\nreally  been  longing  for,  for  years!  Good-bye!’  he  said,  looking \\nat  his  old  home  and  bowing  to  the  door.  ‘Good-bye,  Gandalf!  ’ \\n\\n‘Good-bye,  for  the  present,  Bilbo.  Take  care  of  yourself! \\nYou  are  old  enough,  and  perhaps  wise  enough.’ \\n\\n‘Take  care!  I  don’t  care.  Don’t  you  worry  about  me!  I  am \\nas  happy  now  as  I  have  ever  been,  and  that  is  saying  a  great \\ndeal.  But  the  time  has  come.  I  am  being  swept  off  my  feet  at \\nlast,’  he  added,  and  then  in  a  low  voice,  as  if  to  himself,  he \\nsang  softly  in  the  dark: \\n\\nThe  Road  goes  ever  on  and  on \\nDown  from  the  door  where  it  began. \\n\\nNow  far  ahead  the  Road  has  gone, \\n\\nAnd  I  must  follow,  if  I  can, \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY \\n\\n\\n47 \\n\\n\\nPursuing  it  with  eager  feet, \\n\\nUntil  it  joins  some  larger  way \\nWhere  many  paths  and  errands  meet. \\n\\nAnd  whither  then?  I  cannot  say. \\n\\nHe  paused,  silent  for  a  moment.  Then  without  another  word \\nhe  turned  away  from  the  lights  and  voices  in  the  field  and \\ntents,  and  followed  by  his  three  companions  went  round \\ninto  his  garden,  and  trotted  down  the  long  sloping  path.  He \\njumped  over  a  low  place  in  the  hedge  at  the  bottom,  and  took \\nto  the  meadows,  passing  into  the  night  like  a  rustle  of  wind \\nin  the  grass. \\n\\nGandalf  remained  for  a  while  staring  after  him  into  the \\ndarkness.  ‘Good-bye,  my  dear  Bilbo  -  until  our  next  meet¬ \\ning!’  he  said  softly  and  went  back  indoors. \\n\\nFrodo  came  in  soon  afterwards,  and  found  him  sitting  in \\nthe  dark,  deep  in  thought.  ‘Has  he  gone?’  he  asked. \\n\\n‘Yes,’  answered  Gandalf,  ‘he  has  gone  at  last.’ \\n\\n‘I  wish  - 1  mean,  I  hoped  until  this  evening  that  it  was  only \\na  joke,’  said  Frodo.  ‘But  I  knew  in  my  heart  that  he  really \\nmeant  to  go.  He  always  used  to  joke  about  serious  things.  I \\nwish  I  had  come  back  sooner,  just  to  see  him  off.’ \\n\\n‘I  think  really  he  preferred  slipping  off  quietly  in  the  end,’ \\nsaid  Gandalf.  ‘Don’t  be  too  troubled.  He’ll  be  all  right  -  now. \\nHe  left  a  packet  for  you.  There  it  is!’ \\n\\nFrodo  took  the  envelope  from  the  mantelpiece,  and  glanced \\nat  it,  but  did  not  open  it. \\n\\n‘You’ll  find  his  will  and  all  the  other  documents  in  there,  I \\nthink,’  said  the  wizard.  ‘You  are  the  master  of  Bag  End  now. \\nAnd  also,  I  fancy,  you’ll  find  a  golden  ring.’ \\n\\n‘The  ring!’  exclaimed  Frodo.  ‘Has  he  left  me  that?  I  wonder \\nwhy.  Still,  it  may  be  useful.’ \\n\\n‘It  may,  and  it  may  not,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘I  should  not  make \\nuse  of  it,  if  I  were  you.  But  keep  it  secret,  and  keep  it  safe! \\nNow  I  am  going  to  bed.’ \\n\\n*  *  * \\n\\n\\n48 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nAs  master  of  Bag  End  Frodo  felt  it  his  painful  duty  to  say \\ngood-bye  to  the  guests.  Rumours  of  strange  events  had  by \\nnow  spread  all  over  the  field,  but  Frodo  would  only  say  no \\ndoubt  everything  will  be  cleared  up  in  the  morning.  About  mid¬ \\nnight  carriages  came  for  the  important  folk.  One  by  one \\nthey  rolled  away,  filled  with  full  but  very  unsatisfied  hobbits. \\nGardeners  came  by  arrangement,  and  removed  in  wheel¬ \\nbarrows  those  that  had  inadvertently  remained  behind. \\n\\nNight  slowly  passed.  The  sun  rose.  The  hobbits  rose  rather \\nlater.  Morning  went  on.  People  came  and  began  (by  orders) \\nto  clear  away  the  pavilions  and  the  tables  and  the  chairs,  and \\nthe  spoons  and  knives  and  bottles  and  plates,  and  the  lanterns, \\nand  the  flowering  shrubs  in  boxes,  and  the  crumbs  and \\ncracker-paper,  the  forgotten  bags  and  gloves  and  handker¬ \\nchiefs,  and  the  uneaten  food  (a  very  small  item).  Then  a \\nnumber  of  other  people  came  (without  orders):  Bagginses, \\nand  Boffins,  and  Bolgers,  and  Tooks,  and  other  guests  that \\nlived  or  were  staying  near.  By  mid-day,  when  even  the  best- \\nfed  were  out  and  about  again,  there  was  a  large  crowd  at  Bag \\nEnd,  uninvited  but  not  unexpected. \\n\\nFrodo  was  waiting  on  the  step,  smiling,  but  looking  rather \\ntired  and  worried.  He  welcomed  all  the  callers,  but  he  had \\nnot  much  more  to  say  than  before.  His  reply  to  all  inquiries \\nwas  simply  this:  ‘Air.  Bilbo  Baggins  has  gone  away;  as  far  as \\nI  know,  for  good.’  Some  of  the  visitors  he  invited  to  come \\ninside,  as  Bilbo  had  left  ‘messages’  for  them. \\n\\nInside  in  the  hall  there  was  piled  a  large  assortment  of \\npackages  and  parcels  and  small  articles  of  furniture.  On  every \\nitem  there  was  a  label  tied.  There  were  several  labels  of  this \\nsort: \\n\\nForADELARD  TO  OK,  for  his  VERY  OWN,  from  Bilbo\\',  on \\nan  umbrella.  Adelard  had  carried  off  many  unlabelled  ones. \\n\\nFor  DORA  BAGGINS  in  memory  of  a  LONG  correspon¬ \\ndence,  with  love  from  Bilbo;  on  a  large  waste-paper  basket. \\nDora  was  Drogo’s  sister  and  the  eldest  surviving  female  rela¬ \\ntive  of  Bilbo  and  Frodo;  she  was  ninety-nine,  and  had  written \\nreams  of  good  advice  for  more  than  half  a  century. \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY  49 \\n\\nFor  MILO  BURROWS,  hoping  it  will  be  useful,  from  B.B.; \\non  a  gold  pen  and  ink-bottle.  Milo  never  answered  letters. \\n\\nFor  ANGELICA’S  use,  from  Uncle  Bilbo ;  on  a  round  convex \\nmirror.  She  was  a  young  Baggins,  and  too  obviously  con¬ \\nsidered  her  face  shapely. \\n\\nFor  the  collection  of  HUGO  BRACEGIRDLE,  from  a  con¬ \\ntributor ;  on  an  (empty)  book-case.  Hugo  was  a  great  borrower \\nof  books,  and  worse  than  usual  at  returning  them. \\n\\nFor  LOBELIA  SACKVTI J E-BAGGTNS,  as  a  PRESENT, \\non  a  case  of  silver  spoons.  Bilbo  believed  that  she  had \\nacquired  a  good  many  of  his  spoons,  while  he  was  away  on \\nhis  former  journey.  Lobelia  knew  that  quite  well.  When  she \\narrived  later  in  the  day,  she  took  the  point  at  once,  but  she \\nalso  took  the  spoons. \\n\\nThis  is  only  a  small  selection  of  the  assembled  presents. \\nBilbo’s  residence  had  got  rather  cluttered  up  with  things  in \\nthe  course  of  his  long  life.  It  was  a  tendency  of  hobbit-holes \\nto  get  cluttered  up:  for  which  the  custom  of  giving  so  many \\nbirthday-presents  was  largely  responsible.  Not,  of  course, \\nthat  the  birthday-presents  were  always  new;  there  were  one \\nor  two  old  mathoms  of  forgotten  uses  that  had  circulated  all \\naround  the  district;  but  Bilbo  had  usually  given  new  presents, \\nand  kept  those  that  he  received.  The  old  hole  was  now  being \\ncleared  a  little. \\n\\nEvery  one  of  the  various  parting  gifts  had  labels,  written \\nout  personally  by  Bilbo,  and  several  had  some  point,  or  some \\njoke.  But,  of  course,  most  of  the  things  were  given  where \\nthey  would  be  wanted  and  welcome.  The  poorer  hobbits,  and \\nespecially  those  of  Bagshot  Row,  did  very  well.  Old  Gaffer \\nGamgee  got  two  sacks  of  potatoes,  a  new  spade,  a  woollen \\nwaistcoat,  and  a  bottle  of  ointment  for  creaking  joints.  Old \\nRory  Brandybuck,  in  return  for  much  hospitality,  got  a  dozen \\nbottles  of  Old  Winyards:  a  strong  red  wine  from  the  South¬ \\nfarthing,  and  now  quite  mature,  as  it  had  been  laid  down  by \\nBilbo’s  father.  Rory  quite  forgave  Bilbo,  and  voted  him  a \\ncapital  fellow  after  the  first  bottle. \\n\\n\\n50 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nThere  was  plenty  of  everything  left  for  Frodo.  And,  of \\ncourse,  all  the  chief  treasures,  as  well  as  the  books,  pictures, \\nand  more  than  enough  furniture,  were  left  in  his  possession. \\nThere  was,  however,  no  sign  nor  mention  of  money  or  jewel¬ \\nlery:  not  a  penny-piece  or  a  glass  bead  was  given  away. \\n\\nFrodo  had  a  very  trying  time  that  afternoon.  A  false  rumour \\nthat  the  whole  household  was  being  distributed  free  spread \\nlike  wildfire;  and  before  long  the  place  was  packed  with \\npeople  who  had  no  business  there,  but  could  not  be  kept  out. \\nLabels  got  torn  off  and  mixed,  and  quarrels  broke  out.  Some \\npeople  tried  to  do  swaps  and  deals  in  the  hall;  and  others \\ntried  to  make  off  with  minor  items  not  addressed  to  them,  or \\nwith  anything  that  seemed  unwanted  or  unwatched.  The  road \\nto  the  gate  was  blocked  with  barrows  and  handcarts. \\n\\nIn  the  middle  of  the  commotion  the  Sackville-Bagginses \\narrived.  Frodo  had  retired  for  a  while  and  left  his  friend \\nMerry  Brandybuck  to  keep  an  eye  on  things.  When  Otho \\nloudly  demanded  to  see  Frodo,  Merry  bowed  politely. \\n\\n‘He  is  indisposed,’  he  said.  ‘He  is  resting.’ \\n\\n‘Hiding,  you  mean,’  said  Lobelia.  ‘Anyway  we  want  to  see \\nhim  and  we  mean  to  see  him.  Just  go  and  tell  him  so!’ \\n\\nMerry  left  them  a  long  while  in  the  hall,  and  they  had  time \\nto  discover  their  parting  gift  of  spoons.  It  did  not  improve \\ntheir  tempers.  Eventually  they  were  shown  into  the  study. \\nFrodo  was  sitting  at  a  table  with  a  lot  of  papers  in  front  of \\nhim.  He  looked  indisposed  -  to  see  Sackville-Bagginses  at \\nany  rate;  and  he  stood  up,  fidgeting  with  something  in  his \\npocket.  But  he  spoke  quite  politely. \\n\\nThe  Sackville-Bagginses  were  rather  offensive.  They  began \\nby  offering  him  bad  bargain-prices  (as  between  friends)  for \\nvarious  valuable  and  unlabelled  things.  When  Frodo  replied \\nthat  only  the  things  specially  directed  by  Bilbo  were  being \\ngiven  away,  they  said  the  whole  affair  was  very  fishy. \\n\\n‘Only  one  thing  is  clear  to  me,’  said  Otho,  ‘and  that  is  that \\nyou  are  doing  exceedingly  well  out  of  it.  I  insist  on  seeing \\nthe  will.’ \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY \\n\\n\\n51 \\n\\n\\nOtho  would  have  been  Bilbo’s  heir,  but  for  the  adoption \\nof  Frodo.  He  read  the  will  carefully  and  snorted.  It  was, \\nunfortunately,  very  clear  and  correct  (according  to  the  legal \\ncustoms  of  hobbits,  which  demand  among  other  things  seven \\nsignatures  of  witnesses  in  red  ink) . \\n\\n‘Foiled  again!’  he  said  to  his  wife.  ‘And  after  waiting  sixty \\nyears.  Spoons?  Fiddlesticks!’  He  snapped  his  fingers  under \\nFrodo’s  nose  and  stumped  off.  But  Lobelia  was  not  so  easily \\ngot  rid  of.  A  little  later  Frodo  came  out  of  the  study  to  see \\nhow  things  were  going  on,  and  found  her  still  about  the  place, \\ninvestigating  nooks  and  corners,  and  tapping  the  floors.  He \\nescorted  her  firmly  off  the  premises,  after  he  had  relieved \\nher  of  several  small  (but  rather  valuable)  articles  that  had \\nsomehow  fallen  inside  her  umbrella.  Her  face  looked  as  if  she \\nwas  in  the  throes  of  thinking  out  a  really  crushing  parting \\nremark;  but  all  she  found  to  say,  turning  round  on  the  step, \\nwas: \\n\\n‘You’ll  five  to  regret  it,  young  fellow!  Why  didn’t  you  go \\ntoo?  You  don’t  belong  here;  you’re  no  Baggins  -  you  -  you’re \\na  Brandybuck!’ \\n\\n‘Did  you  hear  that,  Merry?  That  was  an  insult,  if  you  like,’ \\nsaid  Frodo  as  he  shut  the  door  on  her. \\n\\n‘It  was  a  compliment,’  said  Merry  Brandybuck,  ‘and  so,  of \\ncourse,  not  true.’ \\n\\nThen  they  went  round  the  hole,  and  evicted  three  young \\nhobbits  (two  Boffins  and  a  Bolger)  who  were  knocking  holes \\nin  the  walls  of  one  of  the  cellars.  Frodo  also  had  a  tussle  with \\nyoung  Sancho  Proudfoot  (old  Odo  Proudfoot’s  grandson), \\nwho  had  begun  an  excavation  in  the  larger  pantry,  where  he \\nthought  there  was  an  echo.  The  legend  of  Bilbo’s  gold  excited \\nboth  curiosity  and  hope;  for  legendary  gold  (mysteriously \\nobtained,  if  not  positively  ill-gotten),  is,  as  everyone  knows, \\nanyone’s  for  the  finding  -  unless  the  search  is  interrupted. \\n\\nWhen  he  had  overcome  Sancho  and  pushed  him  out, \\nFrodo  collapsed  on  a  chair  in  the  hall.  ‘It’s  time  to  close  the \\nshop,  Merry,’  he  said.  ‘Lock  the  door,  and  don’t  open  it  to \\n\\n\\n52 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nanyone  today,  not  even  if  they  bring  a  battering  ram.’  Then \\nhe  went  to  revive  himself  with  a  belated  cup  of  tea. \\n\\nHe  had  hardly  sat  down,  when  there  came  a  soft  knock  at \\nthe  front-door.  ‘Lobelia  again  most  likely,’  he  thought.  ‘She \\nmust  have  thought  of  something  really  nasty,  and  have  come \\nback  again  to  say  it.  It  can  wait.’ \\n\\nHe  went  on  with  his  tea.  The  knock  was  repeated,  much \\nlouder,  but  he  took  no  notice.  Suddenly  the  wizard’s  head \\nappeared  at  the  window. \\n\\n‘If  you  don’t  let  me  in,  Frodo,  I  shall  blow  your  door  right \\ndown  your  hole  and  out  through  the  hill,’  he  said. \\n\\n‘My  dear  Gandalf!  Half  a  minute!’  cried  Frodo,  running \\nout  of  the  room  to  the  door.  ‘Come  in!  Come  in!  I  thought  it \\nwas  Lobelia.’ \\n\\n‘Then  I  forgive  you.  But  I  saw  her  some  time  ago,  driving \\na  pony-trap  towards  Bywater  with  a  face  that  would  have \\ncurdled  new  milk.’ \\n\\n‘She  had  already  nearly  curdled  me.  Honestly,  I  nearly \\ntried  on  Bilbo’s  ring.  I  longed  to  disappear.’ \\n\\n‘Don’t  do  that!’  said  Gandalf,  sitting  down.  ‘Do  be  careful \\nof  that  ring,  Frodo!  In  fact,  it  is  partly  about  that  that  I  have \\ncome  to  say  a  last  word.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  what  about  it?’ \\n\\n‘What  do  you  know  already?’ \\n\\n‘Only  what  Bilbo  told  me.  I  have  heard  his  story:  how  he \\nfound  it,  and  how  he  used  it:  on  his  journey,  I  mean.’ \\n\\nWhich  story,  I  wonder,’  said  Gandalf. \\n\\n‘Oh,  not  what  he  told  the  dwarves  and  put  in  his  book,’ \\nsaid  Frodo.  ‘He  told  me  the  true  story  soon  after  I  came \\nto  live  here.  He  said  you  had  pestered  him  till  he  told \\nyou,  so  I  had  better  know  too.  “No  secrets  between  us, \\nFrodo,”  he  said;  “but  they  are  not  to  go  any  further.  It’s  mine \\nanyway.”  ’ \\n\\n‘That’s  interesting,’  said  Gandalf.  Well,  what  did  you  think \\nof  it  all?’ \\n\\n‘If  you  mean,  inventing  all  that  about  a  “present”,  well,  I \\nthought  the  true  story  much  more  likely,  and  I  couldn’t  see \\n\\n\\nA  LONG-EXPECTED  PARTY  53 \\n\\nthe  point  of  altering  it  at  all.  It  was  very  unlike  Bilbo  to  do \\nso,  anyway;  and  I  thought  it  rather  odd.’ \\n\\n‘So  did  I.  But  odd  things  may  happen  to  people  that  have \\nsuch  treasures  -  if  they  use  them.  Let  it  be  a  warning  to  you \\nto  be  very  careful  with  it.  It  may  have  other  powers  than  just \\nmaking  you  vanish  when  you  wish  to.’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  understand,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Neither  do  I,’  answered  the  wizard.  ‘I  have  merely  begun \\nto  wonder  about  the  ring,  especially  since  last  night.  No  need \\nto  worry.  But  if  you  take  my  advice  you  will  use  it  very \\nseldom,  or  not  at  all.  At  least  I  beg  you  not  to  use  it  in  any \\nway  that  will  cause  talk  or  rouse  suspicion.  I  say  again:  keep \\nit  safe,  and  keep  it  secret!  ’ \\n\\n‘You  are  very  mysterious!  What  are  you  afraid  of?’ \\n\\n‘I  am  not  certain,  so  I  will  say  no  more.  I  may  be  able  to \\ntell  you  something  when  I  come  back.  I  am  going  off  at  once: \\nso  this  is  good-bye  for  the  present.’  He  got  up. \\n\\n‘At  once!’  cried  Frodo.  ‘Why,  I  thought  you  were  staying \\non  for  at  least  a  week.  I  was  looking  forward  to  your  help.’ \\n\\n‘I  did  mean  to  -  but  I  have  had  to  change  my  mind.  I  may \\nbe  away  for  a  good  while;  but  I’ll  come  and  see  you  again,  as \\nsoon  as  I  can.  Expect  me  when  you  see  me!  I  shall  slip  in \\nquietly.  I  shan’t  often  be  visiting  the  Shire  openly  again.  I \\nfind  that  I  have  become  rather  unpopular.  They  say  I  am  a \\nnuisance  and  a  disturber  of  the  peace.  Some  people  are  actu¬ \\nally  accusing  me  of  spiriting  Bilbo  away,  or  worse.  If  you \\nwant  to  know,  there  is  supposed  to  be  a  plot  between  you \\nand  me  to  get  hold  of  his  wealth.’ \\n\\n‘Some  people!’  exclaimed  Frodo.  ‘You  mean  Otho  and \\nLobelia.  How  abominable!  I  would  give  them  Bag  End  and \\neverything  else,  if  I  could  get  Bilbo  back  and  go  off  tramping \\nin  the  country  with  him.  I  love  the  Shire.  But  I  begin  to  wish, \\nsomehow,  that  I  had  gone  too.  I  wonder  if  I  shall  ever  see \\nhim  again.’ \\n\\n‘So  do  I,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘And  I  wonder  many  other  things. \\nGood-bye  now!  Take  care  of  yourself!  Look  out  for  me, \\nespecially  at  unlikely  times!  Good-bye!’ \\n\\n\\n54 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nFrodo  saw  him  to  the  door.  He  gave  a  final  wave  of  his \\nhand,  and  walked  off  at  a  surprising  pace;  but  Frodo  thought \\nthe  old  wizard  looked  unusually  bent,  almost  as  if  he  was \\ncarrying  a  great  weight.  The  evening  was  closing  in,  and  his \\ncloaked  figure  quickly  vanished  into  the  twilight.  Frodo  did \\nnot  see  him  again  for  a  long  time. \\n\\n\\nChapter  2 \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\nThe  talk  did  not  die  down  in  nine  or  even  ninety-nine  days. \\nThe  second  disappearance  of  Mr.  Bilbo  Baggins  was  dis¬ \\ncussed  in  Hobbiton,  and  indeed  all  over  the  Shire,  for  a  year \\nand  a  day,  and  was  remembered  much  longer  than  that.  It \\nbecame  a  fireside-story  for  young  hobbits;  and  eventually \\nMad  Baggins,  who  used  to  vanish  with  a  bang  and  a  flash \\nand  reappear  with  bags  of  jewels  and  gold,  became  a  favourite \\ncharacter  of  legend  and  lived  on  long  after  all  the  true  events \\nwere  forgotten. \\n\\nBut  in  the  meantime,  the  general  opinion  in  the  neighbour¬ \\nhood  was  that  Bilbo,  who  had  always  been  rather  cracked, \\nhad  at  last  gone  quite  mad,  and  had  run  off  into  the  Blue. \\nThere  he  had  undoubtedly  fallen  into  a  pool  or  a  river  and \\ncome  to  a  tragic,  but  hardly  an  untimely,  end.  The  blame \\nwas  mostly  laid  on  Gandalf. \\n\\n‘If  only  that  dratted  wizard  will  leave  young  Frodo  alone, \\nperhaps  he’ll  settle  down  and  grow  some  hobbit-sense,’  they \\nsaid.  And  to  all  appearance  the  wizard  did  leave  Frodo  alone, \\nand  he  did  settle  down,  but  the  growth  of  hobbit-sense  was \\nnot  very  noticeable.  Indeed,  he  at  once  began  to  carry  on \\nBilbo’s  reputation  for  oddity.  He  refused  to  go  into  mourning; \\nand  the  next  year  he  gave  a  party  in  honour  of  Bilbo’s \\nhundred-and-twelfth  birthday,  which  he  called  a  Hundred¬ \\nweight  Feast.  But  that  was  short  of  the  mark,  for  twenty \\nguests  were  invited  and  there  were  several  meals  at  which  it \\nsnowed  food  and  rained  drink,  as  hobbits  say. \\n\\nSome  people  were  rather  shocked;  but  Frodo  kept  up  the \\ncustom  of  giving  Bilbo’s  Birthday  Party  year  after  year  until \\nthey  got  used  to  it.  He  said  that  he  did  not  think  Bilbo  was \\n\\n\\n56 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\ndead.  When  they  asked:  Where  is  he  then?’  he  shrugged  his \\nshoulders. \\n\\nHe  lived  alone,  as  Bilbo  had  done;  but  he  had  a  good \\nmany  friends,  especially  among  the  younger  hobbits  (mostly \\ndescendants  of  the  Old  Took)  who  had  as  children  been  fond \\nof  Bilbo  and  often  in  and  out  of  Bag  End.  Folco  Boffin  and \\nFredegar  Bolger  were  two  of  these;  but  his  closest  friends \\nwere  Peregrin  Took  (usually  called  Pippin),  and  Merry \\nBrandybuck  (his  real  name  was  Meriadoc,  but  that  was \\nseldom  remembered).  Frodo  went  tramping  over  the  Shire \\nwith  them;  but  more  often  he  wandered  by  himself,  and  to \\nthe  amazement  of  sensible  folk  he  was  sometimes  seen  far \\nfrom  home  walking  in  the  hills  and  woods  under  the  starlight. \\nMerry  and  Pippin  suspected  that  he  visited  the  Elves  at  times, \\nas  Bilbo  had  done. \\n\\nAs  time  went  on,  people  began  to  notice  that  Frodo  also \\nshowed  signs  of  good  ‘preservation’:  outwardly  he  retained \\nthe  appearance  of  a  robust  and  energetic  hobbit  just  out  of \\nhis  tweens.  ‘Some  folk  have  all  the  luck,’  they  said;  but  it  was \\nnot  until  Frodo  approached  the  usually  more  sober  age  of \\nfifty  that  they  began  to  think  it  queer. \\n\\nFrodo  himself,  after  the  first  shock,  found  that  being  his  own \\nmaster  and  the  Mr.  Baggins  of  Bag  End  was  rather  pleasant. \\nFor  some  years  he  was  quite  happy  and  did  not  worry  much \\nabout  the  future.  But  half  unknown  to  himself  the  regret  that \\nhe  had  not  gone  with  Bilbo  was  steadily  growing.  He  found \\nhimself  wondering  at  times,  especially  in  the  autumn,  about \\nthe  wild  lands,  and  strange  visions  of  mountains  that  he  had \\nnever  seen  came  into  his  dreams.  He  began  to  say  to  himself: \\n‘Perhaps  I  shall  cross  the  River  myself  one  day.’  To  which \\nthe  other  half  of  his  mind  always  replied:  ‘Not  yet.’ \\n\\nSo  it  went  on,  until  his  forties  were  running  out,  and  his \\nfiftieth  birthday  was  drawing  near:  fifty  was  a  number  that \\nhe  felt  was  somehow  significant  (or  ominous) ;  it  was  at  any \\nrate  at  that  age  that  adventure  had  suddenly  befallen  Bilbo. \\nFrodo  began  to  feel  restless,  and  the  old  paths  seemed  too \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\n57 \\n\\n\\nwell-trodden.  He  looked  at  maps,  and  wondered  what  lay \\nbeyond  their  edges:  maps  made  in  the  Shire  showed  mostly \\nwhite  spaces  beyond  its  borders.  He  took  to  wandering \\nfurther  afield  and  more  often  by  himself;  and  Merry  and \\nhis  other  friends  watched  him  anxiously.  Often  he  was  seen \\nwalking  and  talking  with  the  strange  wayfarers  that  began  at \\nthis  time  to  appear  in  the  Shire. \\n\\nThere  were  rumours  of  strange  things  happening  in  the \\nworld  outside;  and  as  Gandalf  had  not  at  that  time  appeared  or \\nsent  any  message  for  several  years,  Frodo  gathered  all  the  news \\nhe  could.  Elves,  who  seldom  walked  in  the  Shire,  could  now \\nbe  seen  passing  westward  through  the  woods  in  the  evening, \\npassing  and  not  returning;  but  they  were  leaving  Middle-earth \\nand  were  no  longer  concerned  with  its  troubles.  There  were, \\nhowever,  dwarves  on  the  road  in  unusual  numbers.  The \\nancient  East-West  Road  ran  through  the  Shire  to  its  end  at  the \\nGrey  Havens,  and  dwarves  had  always  used  it  on  their  way  to \\ntheir  mines  in  the  Blue  Mountains.  They  were  the  hobbits’ \\nchief  source  of  news  from  distant  parts  -  if  they  wanted  any:  as \\na  rule  dwarves  said  little  and  hobbits  asked  no  more.  But  now \\nFrodo  often  met  strange  dwarves  of  far  countries,  seeking \\nrefuge  in  the  West.  They  were  troubled,  and  some  spoke  in \\nwhispers  of  the  Enemy  and  of  the  Land  of  Mordor. \\n\\nThat  name  the  hobbits  only  knew  in  legends  of  the  dark \\npast,  like  a  shadow  in  the  background  of  their  memories;  but \\nit  was  ominous  and  disquieting.  It  seemed  that  the  evil  power \\nin  Mirkwood  had  been  driven  out  by  the  White  Council \\nonly  to  reappear  in  greater  strength  in  the  old  strongholds  of \\nMordor.  The  Dark  Tower  had  been  rebuilt,  it  was  said.  From \\nthere  the  power  was  spreading  far  and  wide,  and  away  far \\neast  and  south  there  were  wars  and  growing  fear.  Ores  were \\nmultiplying  again  in  the  mountains.  Trolls  were  abroad,  no \\nlonger  dull-witted,  but  cunning  and  armed  with  dreadful \\nweapons.  And  there  were  murmured  hints  of  creatures  more \\nterrible  than  all  these,  but  they  had  no  name. \\n\\n\\n5§ \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nLittle  of  all  this,  of  course,  reached  the  ears  of  ordinary \\nhobbits.  But  even  the  deafest  and  most  stay-at-home  began \\nto  hear  queer  tales;  and  those  whose  business  took  them  to  the \\nborders  saw  strange  things.  The  conversation  in  The  Green \\nDragon  at  Bywater,  one  evening  in  the  spring  of  Frodo’s \\nfiftieth  year,  showed  that  even  in  the  comfortable  heart  of  the \\nShire  rumours  had  been  heard,  though  most  hobbits  still \\nlaughed  at  them. \\n\\nSam  Gamgee  was  sitting  in  one  corner  near  the  fire,  and \\nopposite  him  was  Ted  Sandyman,  the  miller’s  son;  and  there \\nwere  various  other  rustic  hobbits  listening  to  their  talk. \\n\\n‘Queer  things  you  do  hear  these  days,  to  be  sure,’  said  Sam. \\n\\n‘Ah,’  said  Ted,  ‘you  do,  if  you  listen.  But  I  can  hear  fireside- \\ntales  and  children’s  stories  at  home,  if  I  want  to.’ \\n\\n‘No  doubt  you  can,’  retorted  Sam,  ‘and  I  daresay  there’s \\nmore  truth  in  some  of  them  than  you  reckon.  Who  invented \\nthe  stories  anyway?  Take  dragons  now.’ \\n\\n‘No  thank  ’ee,’  said  Ted,  ‘I  won’t.  I  heard  tell  of  them \\nwhen  I  was  a  youngster,  but  there’s  no  call  to  believe  in  them \\nnow.  There’s  only  one  Dragon  in  Bywater,  and  that’s  Green,’ \\nhe  said,  getting  a  general  laugh. \\n\\n‘All  right,’  said  Sam,  laughing  with  the  rest.  ‘But  what \\nabout  these  Tree-men,  these  giants,  as  you  might  call  them? \\nThey  do  say  that  one  bigger  than  a  tree  was  seen  up  away \\nbeyond  the  North  Moors  not  long  back.’ \\n\\n‘Who’s  they? \\n\\n‘My  cousin  Hal  for  one.  He  works  for  Mr.  Boffin  at \\nOverhill  and  goes  up  to  the  Northfarthing  for  the  hunting. \\nHe  saw  one.’ \\n\\n‘Says  he  did,  perhaps.  Your  Hal’s  always  saying  he’s  seen \\nthings;  and  maybe  he  sees  things  that  ain’t  there.’ \\n\\n‘But  this  one  was  as  big  as  an  elm  tree,  and  walking  - \\nwalking  seven  yards  to  a  stride,  if  it  was  an  inch.’ \\n\\n‘Then  I  bet  it  wasn’t  an  inch.  What  he  saw  was  an  elm  tree, \\nas  like  as  not.’ \\n\\n‘But  this  one  was  walking ,  I  tell  you;  and  there  ain’t  no  elm \\ntree  on  the  North  Moors.’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\n59 \\n\\n\\n‘Then  Hal  can’t  have  seen  one,’  said  Ted.  There  was  some \\nlaughing  and  clapping:  the  audience  seemed  to  think  that \\nTed  had  scored  a  point. \\n\\n‘All  the  same,’  said  Sam,  ‘you  can’t  deny  that  others  besides \\nour  Halfast  have  seen  queer  folk  crossing  the  Shire  -  crossing \\nit,  mind  you:  there  are  more  that  are  turned  back  at  the \\nborders.  The  Bounders  have  never  been  so  busy  before. \\n\\n‘And  I’ve  heard  tell  that  Elves  are  moving  west.  They  do \\nsay  they  are  going  to  the  harbours,  out  away  beyond  the \\nWhite  Towers.’  Sam  waved  his  arm  vaguely:  neither  he  nor \\nany  of  them  knew  how  far  it  was  to  the  Sea,  past  the  old \\ntowers  beyond  the  western  borders  of  the  Shire.  But  it  was \\nan  old  tradition  that  away  over  there  stood  the  Grey  Havens, \\nfrom  which  at  times  elven-ships  set  sail,  never  to  return. \\n\\n‘They  are  sailing,  sailing,  sailing  over  the  Sea,  they  are \\ngoing  into  the  West  and  leaving  us,’  said  Sam,  half  chanting \\nthe  words,  shaking  his  head  sadly  and  solemnly.  But  Ted \\nlaughed. \\n\\n‘Well,  that  isn’t  anything  new,  if  you  believe  the  old  tales. \\nAnd  I  don’t  see  what  it  matters  to  me  or  you.  Let  them  sail! \\nBut  I  warrant  you  haven’t  seen  them  doing  it;  nor  anyone \\nelse  in  the  Shire.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  I  don’t  know,’  said  Sam  thoughtfully.  He  believed \\nhe  had  once  seen  an  Elf  in  the  woods,  and  still  hoped  to  see \\nmore  one  day.  Of  all  the  legends  that  he  had  heard  in  his \\nearly  years  such  fragments  of  tales  and  half-remembered \\nstories  about  the  Elves  as  the  hobbits  knew,  had  always  moved \\nhim  most  deeply.  ‘There  are  some,  even  in  these  parts,  as \\nknow  the  Fair  Folk  and  get  news  of  them,’  he  said.  ‘There’s \\nMr.  Baggins  now,  that  I  work  for.  He  told  me  that  they  were \\nsailing  and  he  knows  a  bit  about  Elves.  And  old  Mr.  Bilbo  knew \\nmore:  many’s  the  talk  I  had  with  him  when  I  was  a  little  lad.’ \\n\\n‘Oh,  they’re  both  cracked,’  said  Ted.  ‘Leastways  old  Bilbo \\nwas  cracked,  and  Frodo’s  cracking.  If  that’s  where  you  get \\nyour  news  from,  you’ll  never  want  for  moonshine.  Well, \\nfriends,  I’m  off  home.  Your  good  health!’  He  drained  his \\nmug  and  went  out  noisily. \\n\\n\\n6o \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nSam  sat  silent  and  said  no  more.  He  had  a  good  deal  to \\nthink  about.  For  one  thing,  there  was  a  lot  to  do  up  in  the \\nBag  End  garden,  and  he  would  have  a  busy  day  tomorrow, \\nif  the  weather  cleared.  The  grass  was  growing  fast.  But  Sam \\nhad  more  on  his  mind  than  gardening.  After  a  while  he \\nsighed,  and  got  up  and  went  out. \\n\\nIt  was  early  April  and  the  sky  was  now  clearing  after  heavy \\nrain.  The  sun  was  down,  and  a  cool  pale  evening  was  quietly \\nfading  into  night.  He  walked  home  under  the  early  stars \\nthrough  Hobbiton  and  up  the  Hill,  whistling  softly  and \\nthoughtfully. \\n\\nIt  was  just  at  this  time  that  Gandalf  reappeared  after  his  long \\nabsence.  For  three  years  after  the  Party  he  had  been  away. \\nThen  he  paid  Frodo  a  brief  visit,  and  after  taking  a  good  look \\nat  him  he  went  off  again.  During  the  next  year  or  two  he  had \\nturned  up  fairly  often,  coming  unexpectedly  after  dusk,  and \\ngoing  off  without  warning  before  sunrise.  He  would  not \\ndiscuss  his  own  business  and  journeys,  and  seemed  chiefly \\ninterested  in  small  news  about  Frodo’s  health  and  doings. \\n\\nThen  suddenly  his  visits  had  ceased.  It  was  over  nine  years \\nsince  Frodo  had  seen  or  heard  of  him,  and  he  had  begun  to \\nthink  that  the  wizard  would  never  return  and  had  given  up \\nall  interest  in  hobbits.  But  that  evening,  as  Sam  was  walking \\nhome  and  twilight  was  fading,  there  came  the  once  familiar \\ntap  on  the  study  window. \\n\\nFrodo  welcomed  his  old  friend  with  surprise  and  great \\ndelight.  They  looked  hard  at  one  another. \\n\\n‘All  well  eh?’  said  Gandalf.  ‘You  look  the  same  as  ever, \\nFrodo!’ \\n\\n‘So  do  you,’  Frodo  replied;  but  secretly  he  thought  that \\nGandalf  looked  older  and  more  careworn.  He  pressed  him \\nfor  news  of  himself  and  of  the  wide  world,  and  soon  they \\nwere  deep  in  talk,  and  they  stayed  up  far  into  the  night. \\n\\nNext  morning  after  a  late  breakfast,  the  wizard  was  sitting \\nwith  Frodo  by  the  open  window  of  the  study.  A  bright  fire \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\n6l \\n\\n\\nwas  on  the  hearth,  but  the  sun  was  warm,  and  the  wind  was \\nin  the  South.  Everything  looked  fresh,  and  the  new  green  of \\nspring  was  shimmering  in  the  fields  and  on  the  tips  of  the \\ntrees’  fingers. \\n\\nGandalf  was  thinking  of  a  spring,  nearly  eighty  years \\nbefore,  when  Bilbo  had  run  out  of  Bag  End  without  a  hand¬ \\nkerchief.  His  hair  was  perhaps  whiter  than  it  had  been  then, \\nand  his  beard  and  eyebrows  were  perhaps  longer,  and  his \\nface  more  lined  with  care  and  wisdom;  but  his  eyes  were  as \\nbright  as  ever,  and  he  smoked  and  blew  smoke-rings  with  the \\nsame  vigour  and  delight. \\n\\nHe  was  smoking  now  in  silence,  for  Frodo  was  sitting  still, \\ndeep  in  thought.  Even  in  the  light  of  morning  he  felt  the  dark \\nshadow  of  the  tidings  that  Gandalf  had  brought.  At  last  he \\nbroke  the  silence. \\n\\n‘Last  night  you  began  to  tell  me  strange  things  about  my \\nring,  Gandalf,’  he  said.  ‘And  then  you  stopped,  because  you \\nsaid  that  such  matters  were  best  left  until  daylight.  Don’t  you \\nthink  you  had  better  finish  now?  You  say  the  ring  is  danger¬ \\nous,  far  more  dangerous  than  I  guess.  In  what  way?’ \\n\\n‘In  many  ways,’  answered  the  wizard.  ‘It  is  far  more  power¬ \\nful  than  I  ever  dared  to  think  at  first,  so  powerful  that  in  the \\nend  it  would  utterly  overcome  anyone  of  mortal  race  who \\npossessed  it.  It  would  possess  him. \\n\\n‘In  Eregion  long  ago  many  Elven-rings  were  made,  magic \\nrings  as  you  call  them,  and  they  were,  of  course,  of  various \\nkinds:  some  more  potent  and  some  less.  The  lesser  rings  were \\nonly  essays  in  the  craft  before  it  was  full-grown,  and  to  the \\nElven-smiths  they  were  but  trifles  -  yet  still  to  my  mind \\ndangerous  for  mortals.  But  the  Great  Rings,  the  Rings  of \\nPower,  they  were  perilous. \\n\\n‘A  mortal,  Frodo,  who  keeps  one  of  the  Great  Rings,  does \\nnot  die,  but  he  does  not  grow  or  obtain  more  life,  he  merely \\ncontinues,  until  at  last  every  minute  is  a  weariness.  And  if \\nhe  often  uses  the  Ring  to  make  himself  invisible,  he  fades\\',  he \\nbecomes  in  the  end  invisible  permanently,  and  walks  in  the \\ntwilight  under  the  eye  of  the  Dark  Power  that  rules  the  Rings. \\n\\n\\n62 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nY es,  sooner  or  later  -  later,  if  he  is  strong  or  well-meaning  to \\nbegin  with,  but  neither  strength  nor  good  purpose  will  last  - \\nsooner  or  later  the  Dark  Power  will  devour  him.’ \\n\\n‘How  terrifying!’  said  Frodo.  There  was  another  long \\nsilence.  The  sound  of  Sam  Gamgee  cutting  the  lawn  came \\nin  from  the  garden. \\n\\n‘How  long  have  you  known  this?’  asked  Frodo  at  length. \\n‘And  how  much  did  Bilbo  know?’ \\n\\n‘Bilbo  knew  no  more  than  he  told  you,  I  am  sure,’  said \\nGandalf.  ‘He  would  certainly  never  have  passed  on  to  you \\nanything  that  he  thought  would  be  a  danger,  even  though  I \\npromised  to  look  after  you.  He  thought  the  ring  was  very \\nbeautiful,  and  very  useful  at  need;  and  if  anything  was  wrong \\nor  queer,  it  was  himself.  He  said  that  it  was  “growing  on  his \\nmind”,  and  he  was  always  worrying  about  it;  but  he  did  not \\nsuspect  that  the  ring  itself  was  to  blame.  Though  he  had \\nfound  out  that  the  thing  needed  looking  after;  it  did  not  seem \\nalways  of  the  same  size  or  weight;  it  shrank  or  expanded  in \\nan  odd  way,  and  might  suddenly  slip  off  a  finger  where  it \\nhad  been  tight.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  he  warned  me  of  that  in  his  last  letter,’  said  Frodo, \\n‘so  I  have  always  kept  it  on  its  chain.’ \\n\\n‘Very  wise,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘But  as  for  his  long  life,  Bilbo \\nnever  connected  it  with  the  ring  at  all.  He  took  all  the  credit \\nfor  that  to  himself,  and  he  was  very  proud  of  it.  Though  he \\nwas  getting  restless  and  uneasy.  Thin  and  stretched  he  said. \\nA  sign  that  the  ring  was  getting  control.’ \\n\\n‘How  long  have  you  known  all  this?’  asked  Frodo  again. \\n\\n‘Known?’  said  Gandalf.  ‘I  have  known  much  that  only  the \\nWise  know,  Frodo.  But  if  you  mean  “known  about  this  ring”, \\nwell,  I  still  do  not  know ,  one  might  say.  There  is  a  last  test  to \\nmake.  But  I  no  longer  doubt  my  guess. \\n\\n‘When  did  I  first  begin  to  guess?’  he  mused,  searching  back \\nin  memory.  ‘Let  me  see  -  it  was  in  the  year  that  the  White \\nCouncil  drove  the  Dark  Power  from  Mirkwood,  just  before \\nthe  Battle  of  Five  Armies,  that  Bilbo  found  his  ring.  A  shadow \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\n63 \\n\\n\\nfell  on  my  heart  then,  though  I  did  not  know  yet  what  I \\nfeared.  I  wondered  often  how  Gollum  came  by  a  Great  Ring, \\nas  plainly  it  was  -  that  at  least  was  clear  from  the  first.  Then \\nI  heard  Bilbo’s  strange  story  of  how  he  had  “won”  it,  and  I \\ncould  not  believe  it.  When  I  at  last  got  the  truth  out  of  him, \\nI  saw  at  once  that  he  had  been  trying  to  put  his  claim  to  the \\nring  beyond  doubt.  Much  like  Gollum  with  his  “birthday- \\npresent”.  The  lies  were  too  much  alike  for  my  comfort. \\nClearly  the  ring  had  an  unwholesome  power  that  set  to  work \\non  its  keeper  at  once.  That  was  the  first  real  warning  I  had \\nthat  all  was  not  well.  I  told  Bilbo  often  that  such  rings  were \\nbetter  left  unused;  but  he  resented  it,  and  soon  got  angry. \\nThere  was  little  else  that  I  could  do.  I  could  not  take  it  from \\nhim  without  doing  greater  harm;  and  I  had  no  right  to  do  so \\nanyway.  I  could  only  watch  and  wait.  I  might  perhaps  have \\nconsulted  Saruman  the  White,  but  something  always  held \\nme  back.’ \\n\\nWho  is  he?’  asked  Frodo.  ‘I  have  never  heard  of  him \\nbefore.’ \\n\\n‘Maybe  not,’  answered  Gandalf.  ‘Hobbits  are,  or  were,  no \\nconcern  of  his.  Yet  he  is  great  among  the  Wise.  He  is  the \\nchief  of  my  order  and  the  head  of  the  Council.  His  knowledge \\nis  deep,  but  his  pride  has  grown  with  it,  and  he  takes  ill  any \\nmeddling.  The  lore  of  the  Elven-rings,  great  and  small,  is  his \\nprovince.  He  has  long  studied  it,  seeking  the  lost  secrets  of \\ntheir  making;  but  when  the  Rings  were  debated  in  the  Coun¬ \\ncil,  all  that  he  would  reveal  to  us  of  his  ring-lore  told  against \\nmy  fears.  So  my  doubt  slept  -  but  uneasily.  Still  I  watched \\nand  I  waited. \\n\\n‘And  all  seemed  well  with  Bilbo.  And  the  years  passed. \\nYes,  they  passed,  and  they  seemed  not  to  touch  him.  He \\nshowed  no  signs  of  age.  The  shadow  fell  on  me  again.  But  I \\nsaid  to  myself:  “After  all  he  comes  of  a  long-lived  family  on \\nhis  mother’s  side.  There  is  time  yet.  Wait!” \\n\\n‘And  I  waited.  Until  that  night  when  he  left  this  house.  He \\nsaid  and  did  things  then  that  filled  me  with  a  fear  that  no \\nwords  of  Saruman  could  allay.  I  knew  at  last  that  something \\n\\n\\n64 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\ndark  and  deadly  was  at  work.  And  I  have  spent  most  of  the \\nyears  since  then  in  finding  out  the  truth  of  it.’ \\n\\n‘There  wasn’t  any  permanent  harm  done,  was  there?’  asked \\nFrodo  anxiously.  ‘He  would  get  all  right  in  time,  wouldn’t \\nhe?  Be  able  to  rest  in  peace,  I  mean?’ \\n\\n‘He  felt  better  at  once,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘But  there  is  only  one \\nPower  in  this  world  that  knows  all  about  the  Rings  and  their \\neffects;  and  as  far  as  I  know  there  is  no  Power  in  the  world \\nthat  knows  all  about  hobbits.  Among  the  Wise  I  am  the \\nonly  one  that  goes  in  for  hobbit-lore:  an  obscure  branch  of \\nknowledge,  but  full  of  surprises.  Soft  as  butter  they  can  be, \\nand  yet  sometimes  as  tough  as  old  tree-roots.  I  think  it  likely \\nthat  some  would  resist  the  Rings  far  longer  than  most  of \\nthe  Wise  would  believe.  I  don’t  think  you  need  worry  about \\nBilbo. \\n\\n‘Of  course,  he  possessed  the  ring  for  many  years,  and  used \\nit,  so  it  might  take  a  long  while  for  the  influence  to  wear  off \\n-  before  it  was  safe  for  him  to  see  it  again,  for  instance. \\nOtherwise,  he  might  live  on  for  years,  quite  happily:  just  stop \\nas  he  was  when  he  parted  with  it.  For  he  gave  it  up  in  the \\nend  of  his  own  accord:  an  important  point.  No,  I  was  not \\ntroubled  about  dear  Bilbo  any  more,  once  he  had  let  the  thing \\ngo.  It  is  for  you  that  I  feel  responsible. \\n\\n‘Ever  since  Bilbo  left  I  have  been  deeply  concerned  about \\nyou,  and  about  all  these  charming,  absurd,  helpless  hobbits. \\nIt  would  be  a  grievous  blow  to  the  world,  if  the  Dark  Power \\novercame  the  Shire;  if  all  your  kind,  jolly,  stupid  Bolgers, \\nHornblowers,  Boffins,  Bracegirdles,  and  the  rest,  not  to \\nmention  the  ridiculous  Bagginses,  became  enslaved.’ \\n\\nFrodo  shuddered.  ‘But  why  should  we  be?’  he  asked.  ‘And \\nwhy  should  he  want  such  slaves?’ \\n\\n‘To  tell  you  the  truth,’  replied  Gandalf,  ‘I  believe  that \\nhitherto  -  hitherto ,  mark  you  -  he  has  entirely  overlooked \\nthe  existence  of  hobbits.  You  should  be  thankful.  But  your \\nsafety  has  passed.  He  does  not  need  you  -  he  has  many \\nmore  useful  servants  -  but  he  won’t  forget  you  again.  And \\nhobbits  as  miserable  slaves  would  please  him  far  more  than \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST  65 \\n\\nhobbits  happy  and  free.  There  is  such  a  thing  as  malice  and \\nrevenge.’ \\n\\n‘Revenge?’  said  Frodo.  ‘Revenge  for  what?  I  still  don’t \\nunderstand  what  all  this  has  to  do  with  Bilbo  and  myself,  and \\nour  ring.’ \\n\\n‘It  has  everything  to  do  with  it,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘You  do  not \\nknow  the  real  peril  yet;  but  you  shall.  I  was  not  sure  of  it \\nmyself  when  I  was  last  here;  but  the  time  has  come  to  speak. \\nGive  me  the  ring  for  a  moment.’ \\n\\nFrodo  took  it  from  his  breeches-pocket,  where  it  was \\nclasped  to  a  chain  that  hung  from  his  belt.  Fie  unfastened  it \\nand  handed  it  slowly  to  the  wizard.  It  felt  suddenly  very \\nheavy,  as  if  either  it  or  Frodo  himself  was  in  some  way  reluc¬ \\ntant  for  Gandalf  to  touch  it. \\n\\nGandalf  held  it  up.  It  looked  to  be  made  of  pure  and  solid \\ngold.  ‘Can  you  see  any  markings  on  it?’  he  asked. \\n\\n‘No,’  said  Frodo.  ‘There  are  none.  It  is  quite  plain,  and  it \\nnever  shows  a  scratch  or  sign  of  wear.’ \\n\\n‘Well  then,  look!’  To  Frodo’s  astonishment  and  distress \\nthe  wizard  threw  it  suddenly  into  the  middle  of  a  glowing \\ncorner  of  the  fire.  Frodo  gave  a  cry  and  groped  for  the  tongs; \\nbut  Gandalf  held  him  back. \\n\\n‘Wait!’  he  said  in  a  commanding  voice,  giving  Frodo  a \\nquick  look  from  under  his  bristling  brows. \\n\\nNo  apparent  change  came  over  the  ring.  After  a  while \\nGandalf  got  up,  closed  the  shutters  outside  the  window,  and \\ndrew  the  curtains.  The  room  became  dark  and  silent,  though \\nthe  clack  of  Sam’s  shears,  now  nearer  to  the  windows,  could \\nstill  be  heard  faintly  from  the  garden.  For  a  moment  the \\nwizard  stood  looking  at  the  fire;  then  he  stooped  and  removed \\nthe  ring  to  the  hearth  with  the  tongs,  and  at  once  picked  it \\nup.  Frodo  gasped. \\n\\n‘It  is  quite  cool,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Take  it!’  Frodo  received  it \\non  his  shrinking  palm:  it  seemed  to  have  become  thicker  and \\nheavier  than  ever. \\n\\n‘Hold  it  up!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘And  look  closely!’ \\n\\n\\n66 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nAs  Frodo  did  so,  he  now  saw  fine  lines,  finer  than  the  finest \\npen-strokes,  running  along  the  ring,  outside  and  inside:  lines \\nof  fire  that  seemed  to  form  the  letters  of  a  flowing  script. \\nThey  shone  piercingly  bright,  and  yet  remote,  as  if  out  of  a \\ngreat  depth. \\n\\n\\n‘I  cannot  read  the  fiery  letters,’  said  Frodo  in  a  quavering \\nvoice. \\n\\n‘No,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘but  I  can.  The  letters  are  Elvish,  of  an \\nancient  mode,  but  the  language  is  that  of  Mordor,  which  I \\nwill  not  utter  here.  But  this  in  the  Common  Tongue  is  what \\nis  said,  close  enough: \\n\\nOne  Ring  to  rule  them  all.  One  Ring  to  find,  them, \\n\\nOne  Ring  to  bring  them  all  and  in  the  darkness  bind  them. \\n\\nIt  is  only  two  lines  of  a  verse  long  known  in  Elven-lore: \\n\\nThree  Rings  for  the  Elven-kings  under  the  sky, \\n\\nSeven  for  the  Dwarf-lords  in  their  halls  of  stone, \\n\\nNine  for  Mortal  Men  doomed  to  die, \\n\\nOne  for  the  Dark  Lord  on  his  dark  throne \\nIn  the  Land  of  Mordor  where  the  Shadows  lie. \\n\\nOne  Ring  to  rule  them  all,  One  Ring  to  find  them, \\n\\nOne  Ring  to  bring  them  all  and  in  the  darkness  bind  them \\nIn  the  Land  of  Mordor  where  the  Shadows  lied \\n\\nHe  paused,  and  then  said  slowly  in  a  deep  voice:  ‘This  is \\nthe  Master-ring,  the  One  Ring  to  rule  them  all.  This  is  the \\nOne  Ring  that  he  lost  many  ages  ago,  to  the  great  weakening \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\n67 \\n\\n\\nof  his  power.  He  greatly  desires  it  -  but  he  must  not  get  it.’ \\n\\nFrodo  sat  silent  and  motionless.  Fear  seemed  to  stretch  out \\na  vast  hand,  like  a  dark  cloud  rising  in  the  East  and  looming \\nup  to  engulf  him.  ‘This  ring!’  he  stammered.  ‘How,  how  on \\nearth  did  it  come  to  me?’ \\n\\n‘Ah!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘That  is  a  very  long  story.  The  begin¬ \\nnings  lie  back  in  the  Black  Years,  which  only  the  lore-masters \\nnow  remember.  If  I  were  to  tell  you  all  that  tale,  we  should \\nstill  be  sitting  here  when  Spring  had  passed  into  Winter. \\n\\n‘But  last  night  I  told  you  of  Sauron  the  Great,  the  Dark \\nLord.  The  rumours  that  you  have  heard  are  true:  he  has \\nindeed  arisen  again  and  left  his  hold  in  Mirkwood  and \\nreturned  to  his  ancient  fastness  in  the  Dark  Tower  of  Mordor. \\nThat  name  even  you  hobbits  have  heard  of,  like  a  shadow  on \\nthe  borders  of  old  stories.  Always  after  a  defeat  and  a  respite, \\nthe  Shadow  takes  another  shape  and  grows  again.’ \\n\\n‘I  wish  it  need  not  have  happened  in  my  time,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘So  do  I,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘and  so  do  all  who  live  to  see  such \\ntimes.  But  that  is  not  for  them  to  decide.  All  we  have  to \\ndecide  is  what  to  do  with  the  time  that  is  given  us.  And \\nalready,  Frodo,  our  time  is  beginning  to  look  black.  The \\nEnemy  is  fast  becoming  very  strong.  His  plans  are  far  from \\nripe,  I  think,  but  they  are  ripening.  We  shall  be  hard  put  to \\nit.  We  should  be  very  hard  put  to  it,  even  if  it  were  not  for \\nthis  dreadful  chance. \\n\\n‘The  Enemy  still  lacks  one  thing  to  give  him  strength  and \\nknowledge  to  beat  down  all  resistance,  break  the  last  defences, \\nand  cover  all  the  lands  in  a  second  darkness.  He  lacks  the \\nOne  Ring. \\n\\n‘The  Three,  fairest  of  all,  the  Elf-lords  hid  from  him,  and \\nhis  hand  never  touched  them  or  sullied  them.  Seven  the \\nDwarf-kings  possessed,  but  three  he  has  recovered,  and  the \\nothers  the  dragons  have  consumed.  Nine  he  gave  to  Mortal \\nMen,  proud  and  great,  and  so  ensnared  them.  Long  ago \\nthey  fell  under  the  dominion  of  the  One,  and  they  became \\nRingwraiths,  shadows  under  his  great  Shadow,  his  most \\n\\n\\n68 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nterrible  servants.  Long  ago.  It  is  many  a  year  since  the  Nine \\nwalked  abroad.  Yet  who  knows?  As  the  Shadow  grows  once \\nmore,  they  too  may  walk  again.  But  come!  We  will  not  speak \\nof  such  things  even  in  the  morning  of  the  Shire. \\n\\n‘So  it  is  now:  the  Nine  he  has  gathered  to  himself;  the \\nSeven  also,  or  else  they  are  destroyed.  The  Three  are  hidden \\nstill.  But  that  no  longer  troubles  him.  He  only  needs  the  One; \\nfor  he  made  that  Ring  himself,  it  is  his,  and  he  let  a  great  part \\nof  his  own  former  power  pass  into  it,  so  that  he  could  rule  all \\nthe  others.  If  he  recovers  it,  then  he  will  command  them  all \\nagain,  wherever  they  be,  even  the  Three,  and  all  that  has \\nbeen  wrought  with  them  will  be  laid  bare,  and  he  will  be \\nstronger  than  ever. \\n\\n‘And  this  is  the  dreadful  chance,  Frodo.  He  believed  that \\nthe  One  had  perished;  that  the  Elves  had  destroyed  it,  as \\nshould  have  been  done.  But  he  knows  now  that  it  has  not \\nperished,  that  it  has  been  found.  So  he  is  seeking  it,  seeking \\nit,  and  all  his  thought  is  bent  on  it.  It  is  his  great  hope  and \\nour  great  fear.’ \\n\\n‘Why,  why  wasn’t  it  destroyed?’  cried  Frodo.  ‘And  how \\ndid  the  Enemy  ever  come  to  lose  it,  if  he  was  so  strong,  and \\nit  was  so  precious  to  him?’  He  clutched  the  Ring  in  his  hand, \\nas  if  he  saw  already  dark  fingers  stretching  out  to  seize  it. \\n\\n‘It  was  taken  from  him,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘The  strength  of \\nthe  Elves  to  resist  him  was  greater  long  ago;  and  not  all \\nMen  were  estranged  from  them.  The  Men  of  Westernesse \\ncame  to  their  aid.  That  is  a  chapter  of  ancient  history \\nwhich  it  might  be  good  to  recall;  for  there  was  sorrow  then \\ntoo,  and  gathering  dark,  but  great  valour,  and  great  deeds \\nthat  were  not  wholly  vain.  One  day,  perhaps,  I  will  tell  you \\nall  the  tale,  or  you  shall  hear  it  told  in  full  by  one  who  knows \\nit  best. \\n\\n‘But  for  the  moment,  since  most  of  all  you  need  to  know \\nhow  this  thing  came  to  you,  and  that  will  be  tale  enough,  this \\nis  all  that  I  will  say.  It  was  Gil-galad,  Elven-king  and  Elendil  of \\nWesternesse  who  overthrew  Sauron,  though  they  themselves \\nperished  in  the  deed;  and  Isildur  Elendil’s  son  cut  the  Ring \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\n69 \\n\\n\\nfrom  Sauron’s  hand  and  took  it  for  his  own.  Then  Sauron \\nwas  vanquished  and  his  spirit  fled  and  was  hidden  for  long \\nyears,  until  his  shadow  took  shape  again  in  Mirkwood. \\n\\n‘But  the  Ring  was  lost.  It  fell  into  the  Great  River,  Anduin, \\nand  vanished.  For  Isildur  was  marching  north  along  the  east \\nbanks  of  the  River,  and  near  the  Gladden  Fields  he  was \\nwaylaid  by  the  Ores  of  the  Mountains,  and  almost  all  his  folk \\nwere  slain.  He  leaped  into  the  waters,  but  the  Ring  slipped \\nfrom  his  finger  as  he  swam,  and  then  the  Ores  saw  him  and \\nkilled  him  with  arrows.’ \\n\\nGandalf  paused.  ‘And  there  in  the  dark  pools  amid  the \\nGladden  Fields,’  he  said,  ‘the  Ring  passed  out  of  knowledge \\nand  legend;  and  even  so  much  of  its  history  is  known  now \\nonly  to  a  few,  and  the  Council  of  the  Wise  could  discover  no \\nmore.  But  at  last  I  can  carry  on  the  story,  I  think. \\n\\n‘Long  after,  but  still  very  long  ago,  there  lived  by  the  banks \\nof  the  Great  River  on  the  edge  of  Wilderland  a  clever-handed \\nand  quiet-footed  little  people.  I  guess  they  were  of  hobbit- \\nkind;  akin  to  the  fathers  of  the  fathers  of  the  Stoors,  for  they \\nloved  the  River,  and  often  swam  in  it,  or  made  little  boats  of \\nreeds.  There  was  among  them  a  family  of  high  repute,  for  it \\nwas  large  and  wealthier  than  most,  and  it  was  ruled  by  a \\ngrandmother  of  the  folk,  stern  and  wise  in  old  lore,  such  as \\nthey  had.  The  most  inquisitive  and  curious-minded  of  that \\nfamily  was  called  Smeagol.  He  was  interested  in  roots  and \\nbeginnings;  he  dived  into  deep  pools;  he  burrowed  under \\ntrees  and  growing  plants;  he  tunnelled  into  green  mounds; \\nand  he  ceased  to  look  up  at  the  hill-tops,  or  the  leaves  on \\ntrees,  or  the  flowers  opening  in  the  air:  his  head  and  his  eyes \\nwere  downward. \\n\\n‘He  had  a  friend  called  Deagol,  of  similar  sort,  sharper¬ \\neyed  but  not  so  quick  and  strong.  On  a  time  they  took  a  boat \\nand  went  down  to  the  Gladden  Fields,  where  there  were  great \\nbeds  of  iris  and  flowering  reeds.  There  Smeagol  got  out  and \\nwent  nosing  about  the  banks  but  Deagol  sat  in  the  boat  and \\nfished.  Suddenly  a  great  fish  took  his  hook,  and  before  he \\n\\n\\n70 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nknew  where  he  was,  he  was  dragged  out  and  down  into  the \\nwater,  to  the  bottom.  Then  he  let  go  of  his  line,  for  he  thought \\nhe  saw  something  shining  in  the  river-bed;  and  holding  his \\nbreath  he  grabbed  at  it. \\n\\n‘Then  up  he  came  spluttering,  with  weeds  in  his  hair  and \\na  handful  of  mud;  and  he  swam  to  the  bank.  And  behold! \\nwhen  he  washed  the  mud  away,  there  in  his  hand  lay  a  beauti¬ \\nful  golden  ring;  and  it  shone  and  glittered  in  the  sun,  so  that \\nhis  heart  was  glad.  But  Smeagol  had  been  watching  him  from \\nbehind  a  tree,  and  as  Deagol  gloated  over  the  ring,  Smeagol \\ncame  softly  up  behind. \\n\\n‘  “Give  us  that,  Deagol,  my  love,”  said  Smeagol,  over  his \\nfriend’s  shoulder. \\n\\n‘  “Why?”  said  Deagol. \\n\\n‘  “Because  it’s  my  birthday,  my  love,  and  I  wants  it,”  said \\nSmeagol. \\n\\n‘  “I  don’t  care,”  said  Deagol.  “I  have  given  you  a  present \\nalready,  more  than  I  could  afford.  I  found  this,  and  I’m  going \\nto  keep  it.” \\n\\n‘  “Oh,  are  you  indeed,  my  love,”  said  Smeagol;  and  he \\ncaught  Deagol  by  the  throat  and  strangled  him,  because  the \\ngold  looked  so  bright  and  beautiful.  Then  he  put  the  ring  on \\nhis  finger. \\n\\n‘No  one  ever  found  out  what  had  become  of  Deagol;  he \\nwas  murdered  far  from  home,  and  his  body  was  cunningly \\nhidden.  But  Smeagol  returned  alone;  and  he  found  that  none \\nof  his  family  could  see  him,  when  he  was  wearing  the  ring. \\nHe  was  very  pleased  with  his  discovery  and  he  concealed  it; \\nand  he  used  it  to  find  out  secrets,  and  he  put  his  knowledge \\nto  crooked  and  malicious  uses.  He  became  sharp-eyed  and \\nkeen-eared  for  all  that  was  hurtful.  The  ring  had  given  him \\npower  according  to  his  stature.  It  is  not  to  be  wondered  at \\nthat  he  became  very  unpopular  and  was  shunned  (when  vis¬ \\nible)  by  all  his  relations.  They  kicked  him,  and  he  bit  their \\nfeet.  He  took  to  thieving,  and  going  about  muttering  to  him¬ \\nself,  and  gurgling  in  his  throat.  So  they  called  him  Golhim, \\nand  cursed  him,  and  told  him  to  go  far  away;  and  his  grand- \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST  71 \\n\\nmother,  desiring  peace,  expelled  him  from  the  family  and \\nturned  him  out  of  her  hole. \\n\\n‘He  wandered  in  loneliness,  weeping  a  little  for  the  hard¬ \\nness  of  the  world,  and  he  journeyed  up  the  River,  till  he  came \\nto  a  stream  that  flowed  down  from  the  mountains,  and  he \\nwent  that  way.  He  caught  fish  in  deep  pools  with  invisible \\nfingers  and  ate  them  raw.  One  day  it  was  very  hot,  and  as  he \\nwas  bending  over  a  pool,  he  felt  a  burning  on  the  back  of  his \\nhead,  and  a  dazzling  light  from  the  water  pained  his  wet  eyes. \\nHe  wondered  at  it,  for  he  had  almost  forgotten  about  the \\nSun.  Then  for  the  last  time  he  looked  up  and  shook  his  fist \\nat  her. \\n\\n‘But  as  he  lowered  his  eyes,  he  saw  far  ahead  the  tops  of \\nthe  Misty  Mountains,  out  of  which  the  stream  came.  And  he \\nthought  suddenly:  “It  would  be  cool  and  shady  under  those \\nmountains.  The  Sun  could  not  watch  me  there.  The  roots  of \\nthose  mountains  must  be  roots  indeed;  there  must  be  great \\nsecrets  buried  there  which  have  not  been  discovered  since \\nthe  beginning.” \\n\\n‘So  he  journeyed  by  night  up  into  the  highlands,  and  he \\nfound  a  little  cave  out  of  which  the  dark  stream  ran;  and  he \\nwormed  his  way  like  a  maggot  into  the  heart  of  the  hills, \\nand  vanished  out  of  all  knowledge.  The  Ring  went  into  the \\nshadows  with  him,  and  even  the  maker,  when  his  power  had \\nbegun  to  grow  again,  could  learn  nothing  of  it.’ \\n\\n‘Gollum!’  cried  Frodo.  ‘Gollum?  Do  you  mean  that  this  is \\nthe  very  Gollum-creature  that  Bilbo  met?  How  loathsome!’ \\n\\n‘I  think  it  is  a  sad  story,’  said  the  wizard,  ‘and  it  might  have \\nhappened  to  others,  even  to  some  hobbits  that  I  have  known.’ \\n\\n‘I  can’t  believe  that  Gollum  was  connected  with  hobbits, \\nhowever  distantly,’  said  Frodo  with  some  heat.  ‘What  an \\nabominable  notion!’ \\n\\n‘It  is  true  all  the  same,’  replied  Gandalf.  ‘About  their \\norigins,  at  any  rate,  I  know  more  than  hobbits  do  themselves. \\nAnd  even  Bilbo’s  story  suggests  the  kinship.  There  was  a \\ngreat  deal  in  the  background  of  their  minds  and  memories \\n\\n\\n72 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nthat  was  very  similar.  They  understood  one  another  remark¬ \\nably  well,  very  much  better  than  a  hobbit  would  understand, \\nsay,  a  Dwarf,  or  an  Ore,  or  even  an  Elf.  Think  of  the  riddles \\nthey  both  knew,  for  one  thing.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  Frodo.  ‘Though  other  folks  besides  hobbits  ask \\nriddles,  and  of  much  the  same  sort.  And  hobbits  don’t  cheat. \\nGollum  meant  to  cheat  all  the  time.  He  was  just  trying  to \\nput  poor  Bilbo  off  his  guard.  And  I  daresay  it  amused  his \\nwickedness  to  start  a  game  which  might  end  in  providing  him \\nwith  an  easy  victim,  but  if  he  lost  would  not  hurt  him.’ \\n\\n‘Only  too  true,  I  fear,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘But  there  was  some¬ \\nthing  else  in  it,  I  think,  which  you  don’t  see  yet.  Even  Gollum \\nwas  not  wholly  ruined.  He  had  proved  tougher  than  even  one \\nof  the  Wise  would  have  guessed  -  as  a  hobbit  might.  There \\nwas  a  little  corner  of  his  mind  that  was  still  his  own,  and  light \\ncame  through  it,  as  through  a  chink  in  the  dark:  light  out  of \\nthe  past.  It  was  actually  pleasant,  I  think,  to  hear  a  kindly \\nvoice  again,  bringing  up  memories  of  wind,  and  trees,  and \\nsun  on  the  grass,  and  such  forgotten  things. \\n\\n‘But  that,  of  course,  would  only  make  the  evil  part  of  him \\nangrier  in  the  end  -  unless  it  could  be  conquered.  Unless  it \\ncould  be  cured.’  Gandalf  sighed.  ‘Alas!  there  is  little  hope  of \\nthat  for  him.  Yet  not  no  hope.  No,  not  though  he  possessed \\nthe  Ring  so  long,  almost  as  far  back  as  he  can  remember.  For \\nit  was  long  since  he  had  worn  it  much:  in  the  black  darkness \\nit  was  seldom  needed.  Certainly  he  had  never  “faded”.  He  is \\nthin  and  tough  still.  But  the  thing  was  eating  up  his  mind,  of \\ncourse,  and  the  torment  had  become  almost  unbearable. \\n\\n‘All  the  “great  secrets”  under  the  mountains  had  turned \\nout  to  be  just  empty  night:  there  was  nothing  more  to  find  out, \\nnothing  worth  doing,  only  nasty  furtive  eating  and  resentful \\nremembering.  He  was  altogether  wretched.  He  hated  the \\ndark,  and  he  hated  light  more:  he  hated  everything,  and  the \\nRing  most  of  all.’ \\n\\n‘What  do  you  mean?’  said  Frodo.  ‘Surely  the  Ring  was  his \\nPrecious  and  the  only  thing  he  cared  for?  But  if  he  hated  it, \\nwhy  didn’t  he  get  rid  of  it,  or  go  away  and  leave  it?’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\n73 \\n\\n\\n‘You  ought  to  begin  to  understand,  Frodo,  after  all  you \\nhave  heard,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘He  hated  it  and  loved  it,  as  he \\nhated  and  loved  himself.  He  could  not  get  rid  of  it.  He  had \\nno  will  left  in  the  matter. \\n\\n‘A  Ring  of  Power  looks  after  itself,  Frodo.  It  may  slip  off \\ntreacherously,  but  its  keeper  never  abandons  it.  At  most  he \\nplays  with  the  idea  of  handing  it  on  to  someone  else’s  care  - \\nand  that  only  at  an  early  stage,  when  it  first  begins  to  grip. \\nBut  as  far  as  I  know  Bilbo  alone  in  history  has  ever  gone \\nbeyond  playing,  and  really  done  it.  He  needed  all  my  help, \\ntoo.  And  even  so  he  would  never  have  just  forsaken  it,  or  cast \\nit  aside.  It  was  not  Gollum,  Frodo,  but  the  Ring  itself  that \\ndecided  things.  The  Ring  left  him.’ \\n\\n‘What,  just  in  time  to  meet  Bilbo?’  said  Frodo.  ‘Wouldn’t \\nan  Ore  have  suited  it  better?’ \\n\\n‘It  is  no  laughing  matter,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Not  for  you.  It \\nwas  the  strangest  event  in  the  whole  history  of  the  Ring  so \\nfar:  Bilbo’s  arrival  just  at  that  time,  and  putting  his  hand  on \\nit,  blindly,  in  the  dark. \\n\\n‘There  was  more  than  one  power  at  work,  Frodo.  The \\nRing  was  trying  to  get  back  to  its  master.  It  had  slipped  from \\nIsildur’s  hand  and  betrayed  him;  then  when  a  chance  came \\nit  caught  poor  Deagol,  and  he  was  murdered;  and  after  that \\nGollum,  and  it  had  devoured  him.  It  could  make  no  further \\nuse  of  him:  he  was  too  small  and  mean;  and  as  long  as  it \\nstayed  with  him  he  would  never  leave  his  deep  pool  again. \\nSo  now,  when  its  master  was  awake  once  more  and  sending \\nout  his  dark  thought  from  Mirkwood,  it  abandoned  Gollum. \\nOnly  to  be  picked  up  by  the  most  unlikely  person  imaginable: \\nBilbo  from  the  Shire! \\n\\n‘Behind  that  there  was  something  else  at  work,  beyond  any \\ndesign  of  the  Ring-maker.  I  can  put  it  no  plainer  than  by \\nsaying  that  Bilbo  was  meant  to  find  the  Ring,  and  not  by  its \\nmaker.  In  which  case  you  also  were  meant  to  have  it.  And \\nthat  may  be  an  encouraging  thought.’ \\n\\n‘It  is  not,’  said  Frodo.  ‘Though  I  am  not  sure  that  I  under¬ \\nstand  you.  But  how  have  you  learned  all  this  about  the  Ring, \\n\\n\\n74 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nand  about  Gollum?  Do  you  really  know  it  all,  or  are  you  just \\nguessing  still?’ \\n\\nGandalf  looked  at  Frodo,  and  his  eyes  glinted.  ‘I  knew \\nmuch  and  I  have  learned  much,’  he  answered.  ‘But  I  am  not \\ngoing  to  give  an  account  of  all  my  doings  to  you.  The  history \\nof  Elendil  and  Isildur  and  the  One  Ring  is  known  to  all  the \\nWise.  Your  ring  is  shown  to  be  that  One  Ring  by  the  fire¬ \\nwriting  alone,  apart  from  any  other  evidence.’ \\n\\n‘And  when  did  you  discover  that?’  asked  Frodo,  inter¬ \\nrupting. \\n\\n‘Just  now  in  this  room,  of  course,’  answered  the  wizard \\nsharply.  ‘But  I  expected  to  find  it.  I  have  come  back  from \\ndark  journeys  and  long  search  to  make  that  final  test.  It  is  the \\nlast  proof,  and  all  is  now  only  too  clear.  Making  out  Gollum’s \\npart,  and  fitting  it  into  the  gap  in  the  history,  required  some \\nthought.  I  may  have  started  with  guesses  about  Gollum,  but \\nI  am  not  guessing  now.  I  know.  I  have  seen  him.’ \\n\\n‘You  have  seen  Gollum?’  exclaimed  Frodo  in  amazement. \\n\\n‘Yes.  The  obvious  thing  to  do,  of  course,  if  one  could.  I \\ntried  long  ago;  but  I  have  managed  it  at  last.’ \\n\\n‘Then  what  happened  after  Bilbo  escaped  from  him?  Do \\nyou  know  that?’ \\n\\n‘Not  so  clearly.  What  I  have  told  you  is  what  Gollum  was \\nwilling  to  tell  -  though  not,  of  course,  in  the  way  I  have \\nreported  it.  Gollum  is  a  liar,  and  you  have  to  sift  his  words. \\nFor  instance,  he  called  the  Ring  his  “birthday-present”,  and \\nhe  stuck  to  that.  He  said  it  came  from  his  grandmother,  who \\nhad  lots  of  beautiful  things  of  that  kind.  A  ridiculous  story.  I \\nhave  no  doubt  that  Smeagol’s  grandmother  was  a  matriarch, \\na  great  person  in  her  way,  but  to  talk  of  her  possessing  many \\nElven-rings  was  absurd,  and  as  for  giving  them  away,  it  was \\na  lie.  But  a  lie  with  a  grain  of  truth. \\n\\n‘The  murder  of  Deagol  haunted  Gollum,  and  he  had  made \\nup  a  defence,  repeating  it  to  his  “Precious”  over  and  over \\nagain,  as  he  gnawed  bones  in  the  dark,  until  he  almost \\nbelieved  it.  It  was  his  birthday.  Deagol  ought  to  have  given \\nthe  ring  to  him.  It  had  obviously  turned  up  just  so  as  to  be \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\n75 \\n\\n\\na  present.  It  was  his  birthday-present,  and  so  on,  and  on. \\n\\n‘I  endured  him  as  long  as  I  could,  but  the  truth  was  desper¬ \\nately  important,  and  in  the  end  I  had  to  be  harsh.  I  put  the \\nfear  of  fire  on  him,  and  wrung  the  true  story  out  of  him,  bit  by \\nbit,  together  with  much  snivelling  and  snarling.  He  thought  he \\nwas  misunderstood  and  ill-used.  But  when  he  had  at  last  told \\nme  his  history,  as  far  as  the  end  of  the  Riddle-game  and \\nBilbo’s  escape,  he  would  not  say  any  more,  except  in  dark \\nhints.  Some  other  fear  was  on  him  greater  than  mine.  He \\nmuttered  that  he  was  going  to  get  his  own  back.  People  would \\nsee  if  he  would  stand  being  kicked,  and  driven  into  a  hole \\nand  then  robbed.  Gollum  had  good  friends  now,  good  friends \\nand  very  strong.  They  would  help  him.  Baggins  would  pay \\nfor  it.  That  was  his  chief  thought.  He  hated  Bilbo  and  cursed \\nhis  name.  What  is  more,  he  knew  where  he  came  from.’ \\n\\n‘But  how  did  he  find  that  out?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Well,  as  for  the  name,  Bilbo  very  foolishly  told  Gollum \\nhimself;  and  after  that  it  would  not  be  difficult  to  discover \\nhis  country,  once  Gollum  came  out.  Oh  yes,  he  came  out. \\nHis  longing  for  the  Ring  proved  stronger  than  his  fear  of \\nthe  Ores,  or  even  of  the  light.  After  a  year  or  two  he  left  the \\nmountains.  You  see,  though  still  bound  by  desire  of  it,  the \\nRing  was  no  longer  devouring  him;  he  began  to  revive  a  little. \\nHe  felt  old,  terribly  old,  yet  less  timid,  and  he  was  mortally \\nhungry. \\n\\n‘Light,  light  of  Sun  and  Moon,  he  still  feared  and  hated, \\nand  he  always  will,  I  think;  but  he  was  cunning.  He  found  he \\ncould  hide  from  daylight  and  moonshine,  and  make  his  way \\nswiftly  and  softly  by  dead  of  night  with  his  pale  cold  eyes, \\nand  catch  small  frightened  or  unwary  things.  He  grew \\nstronger  and  bolder  with  new  food  and  new  air.  He  found \\nhis  way  into  Mirkwood,  as  one  would  expect.  ’ \\n\\n‘Is  that  where  you  found  him?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘I  saw  him  there,’  answered  Gandalf,  ‘but  before  that  he \\nhad  wandered  far,  following  Bilbo’s  trail.  It  was  difficult  to \\nlearn  anything  from  him  for  certain,  for  his  talk  was  con¬ \\nstantly  interrupted  by  curses  and  threats.  “What  had  it  got \\n\\n\\n76 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nin  its  pocketses?”  he  said.  “It  wouldn’t  say,  no  precious.  Little \\ncheat.  Not  a  fair  question.  It  cheated  first,  it  did.  It  broke  the \\nrules.  We  ought  to  have  squeezed  it,  yes  precious.  And  we \\nwill,  precious!” \\n\\n‘That  is  a  sample  of  his  talk.  I  don’t  suppose  you  want  any \\nmore.  I  had  weary  days  of  it.  But  from  hints  dropped  among \\nthe  snarls  I  gathered  that  his  padding  feet  had  taken  him  at \\nlast  to  Esgaroth,  and  even  to  the  streets  of  Dale,  listening \\nsecretly  and  peering.  Well,  the  news  of  the  great  events  went \\nfar  and  wide  in  Wilderland,  and  many  had  heard  Bilbo’s \\nname  and  knew  where  he  came  from.  We  had  made  no  secret \\nof  our  return  journey  to  his  home  in  the  West.  Gollum’s \\nsharp  ears  would  soon  learn  what  he  wanted.’ \\n\\n‘Then  why  didn’t  he  track  Bilbo  further?’  asked  Frodo. \\nWhy  didn’t  he  come  to  the  Shire?’ \\n\\n‘Ah,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘now  we  come  to  it.  I  think  Gollum \\ntried  to.  He  set  out  and  came  back  westward,  as  far  as  the \\nGreat  River.  But  then  he  turned  aside.  He  was  not  daunted \\nby  the  distance,  I  am  sure.  No,  something  else  drew  him \\naway.  So  my  friends  think,  those  that  hunted  him  for  me. \\n\\n‘The  Wood-elves  tracked  him  first,  an  easy  task  for  them, \\nfor  his  trail  was  still  fresh  then.  Through  Mirkwood  and  back \\nagain  it  led  them,  though  they  never  caught  him.  The  wood \\nwas  full  of  the  rumour  of  him,  dreadful  tales  even  among \\nbeasts  and  birds.  The  Woodmen  said  that  there  was  some \\nnew  terror  abroad,  a  ghost  that  drank  blood.  It  climbed  trees \\nto  find  nests;  it  crept  into  holes  to  find  the  young;  it  slipped \\nthrough  windows  to  find  cradles. \\n\\n‘But  at  the  western  edge  of  Mirkwood  the  trail  turned \\naway.  It  wandered  off  southwards  and  passed  out  of  the \\nWood-elves’  ken,  and  was  lost.  And  then  I  made  a  great \\nmistake.  Yes,  Frodo,  and  not  the  first;  though  I  fear  it  may \\nprove  the  worst.  I  let  the  matter  be.  I  let  him  go;  for  I  had \\nmuch  else  to  think  of  at  that  time,  and  I  still  trusted  the  lore \\nof  Saruman. \\n\\n‘Well,  that  was  years  ago.  I  have  paid  for  it  since  with  many \\ndark  and  dangerous  days.  The  trail  was  long  cold  when  I \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\n77 \\n\\n\\ntook  it  up  again,  after  Bilbo  left  here.  And  my  search  would \\nhave  been  in  vain,  but  for  the  help  that  I  had  from  a  friend: \\nAragorn,  the  greatest  traveller  and  huntsman  of  this  age  of \\nthe  world.  Together  we  sought  for  Gollum  down  the  whole \\nlength  of  Wilderland,  without  hope,  and  without  success.  But \\nat  last,  when  I  had  given  up  the  chase  and  turned  to  other \\npaths,  Gollum  was  found.  My  friend  returned  out  of  great \\nperils  bringing  the  miserable  creature  with  him. \\n\\n‘What  he  had  been  doing  he  would  not  say.  He  only  wept \\nand  called  us  cruel,  with  many  a  gollum  in  his  throat;  and \\nwhen  we  pressed  him  he  whined  and  cringed,  and  rubbed \\nhis  long  hands,  licking  his  fingers  as  if  they  pained  him,  as  if \\nhe  remembered  some  old  torture.  But  I  am  afraid  there  is  no \\npossible  doubt:  he  had  made  his  slow,  sneaking  way,  step  by \\nstep,  mile  by  mile,  south,  down  at  last  to  the  Land  of  Mordor.’ \\n\\nA  heavy  silence  fell  in  the  room.  Frodo  could  hear  his  heart \\nbeating.  Even  outside  everything  seemed  still.  No  sound  of \\nSam’s  shears  could  now  be  heard. \\n\\n‘Yes,  to  Mordor,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Alas!  Mordor  draws  all \\nwicked  things,  and  the  Dark  Power  was  bending  all  its  will  to \\ngather  them  there.  The  Ring  of  the  Enemy  would  leave  its \\nmark,  too,  leave  him  open  to  the  summons.  And  all  folk  were \\nwhispering  then  of  the  new  Shadow  in  the  South,  and  its \\nhatred  of  the  West.  There  were  his  fine  new  friends,  who \\nwould  help  him  in  his  revenge! \\n\\nWretched  fool!  In  that  land  he  would  learn  much,  too \\nmuch  for  his  comfort.  And  sooner  or  later  as  he  lurked  and \\npried  on  the  borders  he  would  be  caught,  and  taken  -  for \\nexamination.  That  was  the  way  of  it,  I  fear.  When  he  was \\nfound  he  had  already  been  there  long,  and  was  on  his  way \\nback.  On  some  errand  of  mischief.  But  that  does  not  matter \\nmuch  now.  His  worst  mischief  was  done. \\n\\n‘Yes,  alas!  through  him  the  Enemy  has  learned  that  the \\nOne  has  been  found  again.  He  knows  where  Isildur  fell.  He \\nknows  where  Gollum  found  his  ring.  He  knows  that  it  is  a \\nGreat  Ring,  for  it  gave  long  life.  He  knows  that  it  is  not  one \\n\\n\\n78 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nof  the  Three,  for  they  have  never  been  lost,  and  they  endure \\nno  evil.  He  knows  that  it  is  not  one  of  the  Seven,  or  the  Nine, \\nfor  they  are  accounted  for.  He  knows  that  it  is  the  One.  And \\nhe  has  at  last  heard,  I  think,  of  hobbits  and  the  Shire. \\n\\n‘The  Shire  -  he  may  be  seeking  for  it  now,  if  he  has  not \\nalready  found  out  where  it  lies.  Indeed,  Frodo,  I  fear  that  he \\nmay  even  think  that  the  long-unnoticed  name  of  Baggins  has \\nbecome  important.’ \\n\\n‘But  this  is  terrible!’  cried  Frodo.  ‘Far  worse  than  the  worst \\nthat  I  imagined  from  your  hints  and  warnings.  O  Gandalf, \\nbest  of  friends,  what  am  I  to  do?  For  now  I  am  really  afraid. \\nWhat  am  I  to  do?  What  a  pity  that  Bilbo  did  not  stab  that \\nvile  creature,  when  he  had  a  chance!’ \\n\\n‘Pity?  It  was  Pity  that  stayed  his  hand.  Pity,  and  Mercy: \\nnot  to  strike  without  need.  And  he  has  been  well  rewarded, \\nFrodo.  Be  sure  that  he  took  so  little  hurt  from  the  evil,  and \\nescaped  in  the  end,  because  he  began  his  ownership  of  the \\nRing  so.  With  Pity.’ \\n\\n‘I  am  sorry,’  said  Frodo.  ‘But  I  am  frightened;  and  I  do  not \\nfeel  any  pity  for  Gollum.’ \\n\\n‘You  have  not  seen  him,’  Gandalf  broke  in. \\n\\n‘No,  and  I  don’t  want  to,’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  can’t  understand \\nyou.  Do  you  mean  to  say  that  you,  and  the  Elves,  have  let \\nhim  live  on  after  all  those  horrible  deeds?  Now  at  any  rate  he \\nis  as  bad  as  an  Ore,  and  just  an  enemy.  He  deserves  death.’ \\n\\n‘Deserves  it!  I  daresay  he  does.  Many  that  live  deserve \\ndeath.  And  some  that  die  deserve  life.  Can  you  give  it  to \\nthem?  Then  do  not  be  too  eager  to  deal  out  death  in  judge¬ \\nment.  For  even  the  very  wise  cannot  see  all  ends.  I  have  not \\nmuch  hope  that  Gollum  can  be  cured  before  he  dies,  but \\nthere  is  a  chance  of  it.  And  he  is  bound  up  with  the  fate  of \\nthe  Ring.  My  heart  tells  me  that  he  has  some  part  to  play  yet, \\nfor  good  or  ill,  before  the  end;  and  when  that  comes,  the  pity \\nof  Bilbo  may  rule  the  fate  of  many  -  yours  not  least.  In  any \\ncase  we  did  not  lull  him:  he  is  very  old  and  very  wretched. \\nThe  Wood-elves  have  him  in  prison,  but  they  treat  him  with \\nsuch  kindness  as  they  can  find  in  their  wise  hearts.’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\n79 \\n\\n\\n‘All  the  same,’  said  Frodo,  ‘even  if  Bilbo  could  not  kill \\nGollum,  I  wish  he  had  not  kept  the  Ring.  I  wish  he  had  never \\nfound  it,  and  that  I  had  not  got  it!  Why  did  you  let  me  keep \\nit?  Why  didn’t  you  make  me  throw  it  away,  or,  or  destroy  it?’ \\n\\n‘Let  you?  Make  you?’  said  the  wizard.  ‘Haven’t  you  been \\nlistening  to  all  that  I  have  said?  You  are  not  thinking  of  what \\nyou  are  saying.  But  as  for  throwing  it  away,  that  was  obviously \\nwrong.  These  Rings  have  a  way  of  being  found.  In  evil  hands \\nit  might  have  done  great  evil.  Worst  of  all,  it  might  have  fallen \\ninto  the  hands  of  the  Enemy.  Indeed  it  certainly  would;  for \\nthis  is  the  One,  and  he  is  exerting  all  his  power  to  find  it  or \\ndraw  it  to  himself. \\n\\n‘Of  course,  my  dear  Frodo,  it  was  dangerous  for  you;  and \\nthat  has  troubled  me  deeply.  But  there  was  so  much  at  stake \\nthat  I  had  to  take  some  risk  -  though  even  when  I  was  far \\naway  there  has  never  been  a  day  when  the  Shire  has  not  been \\nguarded  by  watchful  eyes.  As  long  as  you  never  used  it,  I  did \\nnot  think  that  the  Ring  would  have  any  lasting  effect  on \\nyou,  not  for  evil,  not  at  any  rate  for  a  very  long  time.  And \\nyou  must  remember  that  nine  years  ago,  when  I  last  saw  you, \\nI  still  knew  little  for  certain.’ \\n\\n‘But  why  not  destroy  it,  as  you  say  should  have  been  done \\nlong  ago?’  cried  Frodo  again.  ‘If  you  had  warned  me,  or  even \\nsent  me  a  message,  I  would  have  done  away  with  it.’ \\n\\n‘Would  you?  How  would  you  do  that?  Have  you  ever  tried?’ \\n\\n‘No.  But  I  suppose  one  could  hammer  it  or  melt  it.’ \\n\\n‘Try!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Try  now!’ \\n\\nFrodo  drew  the  Ring  out  of  his  pocket  again  and  looked  at \\nit.  It  now  appeared  plain  and  smooth,  without  mark  or  device \\nthat  he  could  see.  The  gold  looked  very  fair  and  pure,  and \\nFrodo  thought  how  rich  and  beautiful  was  its  colour,  how \\nperfect  was  its  roundness.  It  was  an  admirable  thing  and \\naltogether  precious.  When  he  took  it  out  he  had  intended  to \\nfling  it  from  him  into  the  very  hottest  part  of  the  fire.  But  he \\nfound  now  that  he  could  not  do  so,  not  without  a  great \\nstruggle.  He  weighed  the  Ring  in  his  hand,  hesitating,  and \\n\\n\\n8o \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nforcing  himself  to  remember  all  that  Gandalf  had  told  him; \\nand  then  with  an  effort  of  will  he  made  a  movement,  as  if  to \\ncast  it  away  -  but  he  found  that  he  had  put  it  back  in  his \\npocket. \\n\\nGandalf  laughed  grimly.  ‘You  see?  Already  you  too,  Frodo, \\ncannot  easily  let  it  go,  nor  will  to  damage  it.  And  I  could  not \\n“make”  you  -  except  by  force,  which  would  break  your  mind. \\nBut  as  for  breaking  the  Ring,  force  is  useless.  Even  if  you \\ntook  it  and  struck  it  with  a  heavy  sledge-hammer,  it  would \\nmake  no  dint  in  it.  It  cannot  be  unmade  by  your  hands,  or \\nby  mine. \\n\\n‘Your  small  fire,  of  course,  would  not  melt  even  ordinary \\ngold.  This  Ring  has  already  passed  through  it  unscathed,  and \\neven  unheated.  But  there  is  no  smith’s  forge  in  this  Shire  that \\ncould  change  it  at  all.  Not  even  the  anvils  and  furnaces  of  the \\nDwarves  could  do  that.  It  has  been  said  that  dragon-fire  could \\nmelt  and  consume  the  Rings  of  Power,  but  there  is  not  now \\nany  dragon  left  on  earth  in  which  the  old  fire  is  hot  enough; \\nnor  was  there  ever  any  dragon,  not  even  Ancalagon  the  Black, \\nwho  could  have  harmed  the  One  Ring,  the  Ruling  Ring,  for \\nthat  was  made  by  Sauron  himself. \\n\\n‘There  is  only  one  way:  to  find  the  Cracks  of  Doom  in  the \\ndepths  of  Orodruin,  the  Fire-mountain,  and  cast  the  Ring  in \\nthere,  if  you  really  wish  to  destroy  it,  to  put  it  beyond  the \\ngrasp  of  the  Enemy  for  ever.’ \\n\\n‘I  do  really  wish  to  destroy  it!’  cried  Frodo.  ‘Or,  well,  to \\nhave  it  destroyed.  I  am  not  made  for  perilous  quests.  I  wish \\nI  had  never  seen  the  Ring!  Why  did  it  come  to  me?  Why \\nwas  I  chosen?’ \\n\\n‘Such  questions  cannot  be  answered,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘You \\nmay  be  sure  that  it  was  not  for  any  merit  that  others  do  not \\npossess:  not  for  power  or  wisdom,  at  any  rate.  But  you  have \\nbeen  chosen,  and  you  must  therefore  use  such  strength  and \\nheart  and  wits  as  you  have.’ \\n\\n‘But  I  have  so  little  of  any  of  these  things!  You  are  wise \\nand  powerful.  Will  you  not  take  the  Ring?’ \\n\\n‘No!’  cried  Gandalf,  springing  to  his  feet.  With  that  power \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\nI  should  have  power  too  great  and  terrible.  And  over  me  the \\nRing  would  gain  a  power  still  greater  and  more  deadly.’  His \\neyes  flashed  and  his  face  was  lit  as  by  a  fire  within.  ‘Do  not \\ntempt  me!  For  I  do  not  wish  to  become  like  the  Dark  Lord \\nhimself.  Yet  the  way  of  the  Ring  to  my  heart  is  by  pity,  pity \\nfor  weakness  and  the  desire  of  strength  to  do  good.  Do  not \\ntempt  me!  I  dare  not  take  it,  not  even  to  keep  it  safe,  unused. \\nThe  wish  to  wield  it  would  be  too  great  for  my  strength.  I \\nshall  have  such  need  of  it.  Great  perils  lie  before  me.’ \\n\\nHe  went  to  the  window  and  drew  aside  the  curtains  and \\nthe  shutters.  Sunlight  streamed  back  again  into  the  room. \\nSam  passed  along  the  path  outside  whistling.  ‘And  now,’  said \\nthe  wizard,  turning  back  to  Frodo,  ‘the  decision  lies  with  you. \\nBut  I  will  always  help  you.’  He  laid  his  hand  on  Frodo’s \\nshoulder.  ‘I  will  help  you  bear  this  burden,  as  long  as  it  is \\nyours  to  bear.  But  we  must  do  something,  soon.  The  Enemy \\nis  moving.’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  long  silence.  Gandalf  sat  down  again  and \\npuffed  at  his  pipe,  as  if  lost  in  thought.  His  eyes  seemed \\nclosed,  but  under  the  lids  he  was  watching  Frodo  intently. \\nFrodo  gazed  fixedly  at  the  red  embers  on  the  hearth,  until \\nthey  filled  all  his  vision,  and  he  seemed  to  be  looking  down \\ninto  profound  wells  of  fire.  He  was  thinking  of  the  fabled \\nCracks  of  Doom  and  the  terror  of  the  Fiery  Mountain. \\n\\n‘Well!’  said  Gandalf  at  last.  ‘What  are  you  thinking  about? \\nHave  you  decided  what  to  do?’ \\n\\n‘No!’  answered  Frodo,  coming  back  to  himself  out  of  dark¬ \\nness,  and  finding  to  his  surprise  that  it  was  not  dark,  and  that \\nout  of  the  window  he  could  see  the  sunlit  garden.  ‘Or  perhaps, \\nyes.  As  far  as  I  understand  what  you  have  said,  I  suppose  I \\nmust  keep  the  Ring  and  guard  it,  at  least  for  the  present, \\nwhatever  it  may  do  to  me.’ \\n\\n‘Whatever  it  may  do,  it  will  be  slow,  slow  to  evil,  if  you \\nkeep  it  with  that  purpose,’  said  Gandalf. \\n\\n‘I  hope  so,’  said  Frodo.  ‘But  I  hope  that  you  may  find  some \\nother  better  keeper  soon.  But  in  the  meanwhile  it  seems  that \\n\\n\\n82 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nI  am  a  danger,  a  danger  to  all  that  live  near  me.  I  cannot  keep \\nthe  Ring  and  stay  here.  I  ought  to  leave  Bag  End,  leave  the \\nShire,  leave  everything  and  go  away.’  He  sighed. \\n\\n‘I  should  like  to  save  the  Shire,  if  I  could  -  though  there \\nhave  been  times  when  I  thought  the  inhabitants  too  stupid \\nand  dull  for  words,  and  have  felt  that  an  earthquake  or  an \\ninvasion  of  dragons  might  be  good  for  them.  But  I  don’t  feel \\nlike  that  now.  I  feel  that  as  long  as  the  Shire  lies  behind,  safe \\nand  comfortable,  I  shall  find  wandering  more  bearable:  I  shall \\nknow  that  somewhere  there  is  a  firm  foothold,  even  if  my  feet \\ncannot  stand  there  again. \\n\\n‘Of  course,  I  have  sometimes  thought  of  going  away,  but \\nI  imagined  that  as  a  kind  of  holiday,  a  series  of  adventures \\nlike  Bilbo’s  or  better,  ending  in  peace.  But  this  would  mean \\nexile,  a  flight  from  danger  into  danger,  drawing  it  after  me. \\nAnd  I  suppose  I  must  go  alone,  if  I  am  to  do  that  and  save \\nthe  Shire.  But  I  feel  very  small,  and  very  uprooted,  and  well \\n-  desperate.  The  Enemy  is  so  strong  and  terrible.’ \\n\\nHe  did  not  tell  Gandalf,  but  as  he  was  speaking  a  great \\ndesire  to  follow  Bilbo  flamed  up  in  his  heart  -  to  follow  Bilbo, \\nand  even  perhaps  to  find  him  again.  It  was  so  strong  that  it \\novercame  his  fear:  he  could  almost  have  run  out  there  and \\nthen  down  the  road  without  his  hat,  as  Bilbo  had  done  on  a \\nsimilar  morning  long  ago. \\n\\n‘My  dear  Frodo!’  exclaimed  Gandalf.  ‘Hobbits  really  are \\namazing  creatures,  as  I  have  said  before.  You  can  learn  all \\nthat  there  is  to  know  about  their  ways  in  a  month,  and  yet \\nafter  a  hundred  years  they  can  still  surprise  you  at  a  pinch.  I \\nhardly  expected  to  get  such  an  answer,  not  even  from  you. \\nBut  Bilbo  made  no  mistake  in  choosing  his  heir,  though  he \\nlittle  thought  how  important  it  would  prove.  I  am  afraid  you \\nare  right.  The  Ring  will  not  be  able  to  stay  hidden  in  the \\nShire  much  longer;  and  for  your  own  sake,  as  well  as  for \\nothers,  you  will  have  to  go,  and  leave  the  name  of  Baggins \\nbehind  you.  That  name  will  not  be  safe  to  have,  outside  the \\nShire  or  in  the  Wild.  I  will  give  you  a  travelling  name  now. \\nWhen  you  go,  go  as  Mr.  Underhill. \\n\\n\\nTHE  SHADOW  OF  THE  PAST \\n\\n\\n83 \\n\\n\\n‘But  I  don’t  think  you  need  go  alone.  Not  if  you  know  of \\nanyone  you  can  trust,  and  who  would  be  willing  to  go  by \\nyour  side  -  and  that  you  would  be  willing  to  take  into \\nunknown  perils.  But  if  you  look  for  a  companion,  be  careful \\nin  choosing!  And  be  careful  of  what  you  say,  even  to  your \\nclosest  friends!  The  enemy  has  many  spies  and  many  ways \\nof  hearing.’ \\n\\nSuddenly  he  stopped  as  if  listening.  Frodo  became  aware \\nthat  all  was  very  quiet,  inside  and  outside.  Gandalf  crept  to \\none  side  of  the  window.  Then  with  a  dart  he  sprang  to  the \\nsill,  and  thrust  a  long  arm  out  and  downwards.  There  was  a \\nsquawk,  and  up  came  Sam  Gamgee’s  curly  head  hauled  by \\none  ear. \\n\\n‘Well,  well,  bless  my  beard!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Sam  Gamgee \\nis  it?  Now  what  may  you  be  doing?’ \\n\\n‘Lor  bless  you,  Mr.  Gandalf,  sir!’  said  Sam.  ‘Nothing! \\nLeastways  I  was  just  trimming  the  grass-border  under  the \\nwindow,  if  you  follow  me.’  He  picked  up  his  shears  and \\nexhibited  them  as  evidence. \\n\\n‘I  don’t,’  said  Gandalf  grimly.  ‘It  is  some  time  since  I  last \\nheard  the  sound  of  your  shears.  How  long  have  you  been \\neavesdropping?’ \\n\\n‘Eavesdropping,  sir?  I  don’t  follow  you,  begging  your \\npardon.  There  ain’t  no  eaves  at  Bag  End,  and  that’s  a  fact.’ \\n\\n‘Don’t  be  a  fool!  What  have  you  heard,  and  why  did  you \\nlisten?’  Gandalf ’s  eyes  flashed  and  his  brows  stuck  out  like \\nbristles. \\n\\n‘Mr.  Frodo,  sir!’  cried  Sam  quaking.  ‘Don’t  let  him  hurt \\nme,  sir!  Don’t  let  him  turn  me  into  anything  unnatural!  My \\nold  dad  would  take  on  so.  I  meant  no  harm,  on  my  honour, \\nsir!’ \\n\\n‘He  won’t  hurt  you,’  said  Frodo,  hardly  able  to  keep  from \\nlaughing,  although  he  was  himself  startled  and  rather  puzzled. \\n‘He  knows,  as  well  as  I  do,  that  you  mean  no  harm.  But  just \\nyou  up  and  answer  his  questions  straight  away!’ \\n\\nWell,  sir,’  said  Sam  dithering  a  little.  ‘I  heard  a  deal  that \\nI  didn’t  rightly  understand,  about  an  enemy,  and  rings,  and \\n\\n\\n84 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nMr.  Bilbo,  sir,  and  dragons,  and  a  fiery  mountain,  and  -  and \\nElves,  sir.  I  listened  because  I  couldn’t  help  myself,  if  you \\nknow  what  I  mean.  Lor  bless  me,  sir,  but  I  do  love  tales  of \\nthat  sort.  And  I  believe  them  too,  whatever  Ted  may  say. \\nElves,  sir!  I  would  dearly  love  to  see  them.  Couldn’t  you  take \\nme  to  see  Elves,  sir,  when  you  go?’ \\n\\nSuddenly  Gandalf  laughed.  ‘Come  inside!’  he  shouted,  and \\nputting  out  both  his  arms  he  lifted  the  astonished  Sam,  shears, \\ngrass-clippings  and  all,  right  through  the  window  and  stood \\nhim  on  the  floor.  ‘Take  you  to  see  Elves,  eh?’  he  said,  eyeing \\nSam  closely,  but  with  a  smile  flickering  on  his  face.  ‘So  you \\nheard  that  Mr.  Frodo  is  going  away?’ \\n\\n‘I  did,  sir.  And  that’s  why  I  choked:  which  you  heard \\nseemingly.  I  tried  not  to,  sir,  but  it  burst  out  of  me:  I  was  so \\nupset.’ \\n\\n‘It  can’t  be  helped,  Sam,’  said  Frodo  sadly.  He  had  sud¬ \\ndenly  realized  that  flying  from  the  Shire  would  mean  more \\npainful  partings  than  merely  saying  farewell  to  the  familiar \\ncomforts  of  Bag  End.  ‘I  shall  have  to  go.  But’  -  and  here  he \\nlooked  hard  at  Sam  -  ‘if  you  really  care  about  me,  you  will \\nkeep  that  dead  secret.  See?  If  you  don’t,  if  you  even  breathe \\na  word  of  what  you’ve  heard  here,  then  I  hope  Gandalf  will \\nturn  you  into  a  spotted  toad  and  fill  the  garden  full  of  grass- \\nsnakes.’ \\n\\nSam  fell  on  his  knees,  trembling.  ‘Get  up,  Sam!’  said \\nGandalf.  ‘I  have  thought  of  something  better  than  that.  Some¬ \\nthing  to  shut  your  mouth,  and  punish  you  properly  for  listen¬ \\ning.  You  shall  go  away  with  Mr.  Frodo!’ \\n\\n‘Me,  sir!’  cried  Sam,  springing  up  like  a  dog  invited  for  a \\nwalk.  ‘Me  go  and  see  Elves  and  all!  Hooray!’  he  shouted,  and \\nthen  burst  into  tears. \\n\\n\\nChapter  3 \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\n‘You  ought  to  go  quietly,  and  you  ought  to  go  soon,’  said \\nGandalf.  Two  or  three  weeks  had  passed,  and  still  Frodo \\nmade  no  sign  of  getting  ready  to  go. \\n\\n‘I  know.  But  it  is  difficult  to  do  both,’  he  objected.  ‘If  I  just \\nvanish  like  Bilbo,  the  tale  will  be  all  over  the  Shire  in  no  time.’ \\n\\n‘Of  course  you  mustn’t  vanish!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘That \\nwouldn’t  do  at  all!  I  said  soon,  not  instantly.  If  you  can  think \\nof  any  way  of  slipping  out  of  the  Shire  without  its  being \\ngenerally  known,  it  will  be  worth  a  little  delay.  But  you  must \\nnot  delay  too  long.’ \\n\\n‘What  about  the  autumn,  on  or  after  Our  Birthday?’  asked \\nFrodo.  ‘I  think  I  could  probably  make  some  arrangements  by \\nthen.’ \\n\\nTo  tell  the  truth,  he  was  very  reluctant  to  start,  now  that  it \\nhad  come  to  the  point:  Bag  End  seemed  a  more  desirable \\nresidence  than  it  had  for  years,  and  he  wanted  to  savour  as \\nmuch  as  he  could  of  his  last  summer  in  the  Shire.  When \\nautumn  came,  he  knew  that  part  at  least  of  his  heart  would \\nthink  more  kindly  of  journeying,  as  it  always  did  at  that \\nseason.  He  had  indeed  privately  made  up  his  mind  to  leave \\non  his  fiftieth  birthday:  Bilbo’s  one  hundred  and  twenty- \\neighth.  It  seemed  somehow  the  proper  day  on  which  to  set \\nout  and  follow  him.  Following  Bilbo  was  uppermost  in  his \\nmind,  and  the  one  thing  that  made  the  thought  of  leaving \\nbearable.  He  thought  as  little  as  possible  about  the  Ring,  and \\nwhere  it  might  lead  him  in  the  end.  But  he  did  not  tell  all  his \\nthoughts  to  Gandalf.  What  the  wizard  guessed  was  always \\ndifficult  to  tell. \\n\\nHe  looked  at  Frodo  and  smiled.  ‘Very  well,’  he  said.  ‘I  think \\nthat  will  do  -  but  it  must  not  be  any  later.  I  am  getting  very \\n\\n\\n86 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nanxious.  In  the  meanwhile,  do  take  care,  and  don’t  let  out \\nany  hint  of  where  you  are  going!  And  see  that  Sam  Gamgee \\ndoes  not  talk.  If  he  does,  I  really  shall  turn  him  into  a  toad.’ \\n\\n‘As  for  where  I  am  going,’  said  Frodo,  ‘it  would  be  difficult \\nto  give  that  away,  for  I  have  no  clear  idea  myself,  yet.’ \\n\\n‘Don’t  be  absurd!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘I  am  not  warning  you \\nagainst  leaving  an  address  at  the  post-office!  But  you  are \\nleaving  the  Shire  -  and  that  should  not  be  known,  until  you \\nare  far  away.  And  you  must  go,  or  at  least  set  out,  either \\nNorth,  South,  West  or  East  -  and  the  direction  should  cer¬ \\ntainly  not  be  known.’ \\n\\n‘I  have  been  so  taken  up  with  the  thoughts  of  leaving  Bag \\nEnd,  and  of  saying  farewell,  that  I  have  never  even  considered \\nthe  direction,’  said  Frodo.  ‘For  where  am  I  to  go?  And  by \\nwhat  shall  I  steer?  What  is  to  be  my  quest?  Bilbo  went  to  find \\na  treasure,  there  and  back  again;  but  I  go  to  lose  one,  and  not \\nreturn,  as  far  as  I  can  see.’ \\n\\n‘But  you  cannot  see  very  far,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Neither  can \\nI.  It  may  be  your  task  to  find  the  Cracks  of  Doom;  but  that \\nquest  may  be  for  others:  I  do  not  know.  At  any  rate  you  are \\nnot  ready  for  that  long  road  yet.’ \\n\\n‘No  indeed!’  said  Frodo.  ‘But  in  the  meantime  what  course \\nam  I  to  take?’ \\n\\n‘Towards  danger;  but  not  too  rashly,  nor  too  straight,’ \\nanswered  the  wizard.  ‘If  you  want  my  advice,  make  for \\nRivendell.  That  journey  should  not  prove  too  perilous, \\nthough  the  Road  is  less  easy  than  it  was,  and  it  will  grow \\nworse  as  the  year  fails.’ \\n\\n‘Rivendell!’  said  Frodo.  ‘Very  good:  I  will  go  east,  and  I \\nwill  make  for  Rivendell.  I  will  take  Sam  to  visit  the  Elves;  he \\nwill  be  delighted.’  He  spoke  lightly;  but  his  heart  was  moved \\nsuddenly  with  a  desire  to  see  the  house  of  Elrond  Halfelven, \\nand  breathe  the  air  of  that  deep  valley  where  many  of  the \\nFair  Folk  still  dwelt  in  peace. \\n\\nOne  summer’s  evening  an  astonishing  piece  of  news \\nreached  the  Ivy  Bush  and  Green  Dragon.  Giants  and  other \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\n87 \\n\\n\\nportents  on  the  borders  of  the  Shire  were  forgotten  for  more \\nimportant  matters:  Mr.  Frodo  was  selling  Bag  End,  indeed \\nhe  had  already  sold  it  -  to  the  Sackville-Bagginses! \\n\\n‘For  a  nice  bit,  too,’  said  some.  ‘At  a  bargain  price,’  said \\nothers,  ‘and  that’s  more  likely  when  Mistress  Lobelia’s  the \\nbuyer.’  (Otho  had  died  some  years  before,  at  the  ripe  but \\ndisappointed  age  of  102.) \\n\\nJust  why  Mr.  Frodo  was  selling  his  beautiful  hole  was  even \\nmore  debatable  than  the  price.  A  few  held  the  theory  -  sup¬ \\nported  by  the  nods  and  hints  of  Air.  Baggins  himself  -  that \\nFrodo’s  money  was  running  out:  he  was  going  to  leave \\nHobbiton  and  live  in  a  quiet  way  on  the  proceeds  of  the  sale \\ndown  in  Buckland  among  his  Brandybuck  relations.  ‘As  far \\nfrom  the  Sackville-Bagginses  as  may  be,’  some  added.  But  so \\nfirmly  fixed  had  the  notion  of  the  immeasurable  wealth  of  the \\nBagginses  of  Bag  End  become  that  most  found  this  hard  to \\nbelieve,  harder  than  any  other  reason  or  unreason  that  their \\nfancy  could  suggest:  to  most  it  suggested  a  dark  and  yet \\nunrevealed  plot  by  Gandalf.  Though  he  kept  himself  very \\nquiet  and  did  not  go  about  by  day,  it  was  well  known  that  he \\nwas  ‘hiding  up  in  the  Bag  End’.  But  however  a  removal  might \\nfit  in  with  the  designs  of  his  wizardry,  there  was  no  doubt \\nabout  the  fact:  Frodo  Baggins  was  going  back  to  Buckland. \\n\\n‘Yes,  I  shall  be  moving  this  autumn,’  he  said.  ‘Merry \\nBrandybuck  is  looking  out  for  a  nice  little  hole  for  me,  or \\nperhaps  a  small  house.’ \\n\\nAs  a  matter  of  fact  with  Merry’s  help  he  had  already  chosen \\nand  bought  a  little  house  at  Crickhollow  in  the  country \\nbeyond  Bucklebury.  To  all  but  Sam  he  pretended  he  was \\ngoing  to  settle  down  there  permanently.  The  decision  to  set \\nout  eastwards  had  suggested  the  idea  to  him;  for  Buckland \\nwas  on  the  eastern  borders  of  the  Shire,  and  as  he  had  lived \\nthere  in  childhood  his  going  back  would  at  least  seem \\ncredible. \\n\\nGandalf  stayed  in  the  Shire  for  over  two  months.  Then  one \\nevening,  at  the  end  of  June,  soon  after  Frodo’s  plan  had  been \\n\\n\\n88 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nfinally  arranged,  he  suddenly  announced  that  he  was  going \\noff  again  next  morning.  ‘Only  for  a  short  while,  I  hope,’  he \\nsaid.  ‘But  I  am  going  down  beyond  the  southern  borders  to \\nget  some  news,  if  I  can.  I  have  been  idle  longer  than  I  should.’ \\n\\nHe  spoke  lightly,  but  it  seemed  to  Frodo  that  he  looked \\nrather  worried.  ‘Has  anything  happened?’  he  asked. \\n\\n‘Well  no;  but  I  have  heard  something  that  has  made  me \\nanxious  and  needs  looking  into.  If  I  think  it  necessary  after \\nall  for  you  to  get  off  at  once,  I  shall  come  back  immediately, \\nor  at  least  send  word.  In  the  meanwhile  stick  to  your  plan; \\nbut  be  more  careful  than  ever,  especially  of  the  Ring.  Let  me \\nimpress  on  you  once  more:  don’t  use  it!’ \\n\\nHe  went  off  at  dawn.  ‘I  may  be  back  any  day,’  he  said.  ‘At \\nthe  very  latest  I  shall  come  back  for  the  farewell  party.  I  think \\nafter  all  you  may  need  my  company  on  the  Road.’ \\n\\nAt  first  Frodo  was  a  good  deal  disturbed,  and  wondered \\noften  what  Gandalf  could  have  heard;  but  his  uneasiness \\nwore  off,  and  in  the  fine  weather  he  forgot  his  troubles  for  a \\nwhile.  The  Shire  had  seldom  seen  so  fair  a  summer,  or  so \\nrich  an  autumn:  the  trees  were  laden  with  apples,  honey  was \\ndripping  in  the  combs,  and  the  corn  was  tall  and  full. \\n\\nAutumn  was  well  under  way  before  Frodo  began  to  worry \\nabout  Gandalf  again.  September  was  passing  and  there  was \\nstill  no  news  of  him.  The  Birthday,  and  the  removal,  drew \\nnearer,  and  still  he  did  not  come,  or  send  word.  Bag  End \\nbegan  to  be  busy.  Some  of  Frodo’s  friends  came  to  stay  and \\nhelp  him  with  the  packing:  there  was  Fredegar  Bolger  and \\nFolco  Boffin,  and  of  course  his  special  friends  Pippin  Took \\nand  Merry  Brandybuck.  Between  them  they  turned  the  whole \\nplace  upside-down. \\n\\nOn  September  20th  two  covered  carts  went  off  laden  to \\nBuckland,  conveying  the  furniture  and  goods  that  Frodo  had \\nnot  sold  to  his  new  home,  by  way  of  the  Brandywine \\nBridge. The  next  day  Frodo  became  really  anxious,  and  kept \\na  constant  look-out  for  Gandalf.  Thursday,  his  birthday \\nmorning,  dawned  as  fair  and  clear  as  it  had  long  ago  for \\nBilbo’s  great  party.  Still  Gandalf  did  not  appear.  In  the \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\n89 \\n\\n\\nevening  Frodo  gave  his  farewell  feast:  it  was  quite  small,  just \\na  dinner  for  himself  and  his  four  helpers;  but  he  was  troubled \\nand  felt  in  no  mood  for  it.  The  thought  that  he  would  so \\nsoon  have  to  part  with  his  young  friends  weighed  on  his  heart. \\nHe  wondered  how  he  would  break  it  to  them. \\n\\nThe  four  younger  hobbits  were,  however,  in  high  spirits, \\nand  the  party  soon  became  very  cheerful  in  spite  of  Gandalf ’s \\nabsence.  The  dining-room  was  bare  except  for  a  table  and \\nchairs,  but  the  food  was  good,  and  there  was  good  wine: \\nFrodo’s  wine  had  not  been  included  in  the  sale  to  the \\nSackville-Bagginses. \\n\\n‘Whatever  happens  to  the  rest  of  my  stuff,  when  the  S.-B.s \\nget  their  claws  on  it,  at  any  rate  I  have  found  a  good  home \\nfor  this!’  said  Frodo,  as  he  drained  his  glass.  It  was  the  last \\ndrop  of  Old  Winyards. \\n\\nWhen  they  had  sung  many  songs,  and  talked  of  many \\nthings  they  had  done  together,  they  toasted  Bilbo’s  birthday, \\nand  they  drank  his  health  and  Frodo’s  together  according  to \\nFrodo’s  custom.  Then  they  went  out  for  a  sniff  of  air,  and \\nglimpse  of  the  stars,  and  then  they  went  to  bed.  Frodo’s  party \\nwas  over,  and  Gandalf  had  not  come. \\n\\nThe  next  morning  they  were  busy  packing  another  cart \\nwith  the  remainder  of  the  luggage.  Merry  took  charge  of  this, \\nand  drove  off  with  Fatty  (that  is  Fredegar  Bolger).  ‘Someone \\nmust  get  there  and  warm  the  house  before  you  arrive,’  said \\nMerry.  ‘Well,  see  you  later  -  the  day  after  tomorrow,  if  you \\ndon’t  go  to  sleep  on  the  way!’ \\n\\nFolco  went  home  after  lunch,  but  Pippin  remained  behind. \\nFrodo  was  restless  and  anxious,  listening  in  vain  for  a  sound \\nof  Gandalf.  He  decided  to  wait  until  nightfall.  After  that,  if \\nGandalf  wanted  him  urgently,  he  would  go  to  Crickhollow, \\nand  might  even  get  there  first.  For  Frodo  was  going  on  foot. \\nHis  plan  -  for  pleasure  and  a  last  look  at  the  Shire  as  much  as \\nany  other  reason  -  was  to  walk  from  Hobbiton  to  Bucklebury \\nFerry,  taking  it  fairly  easy. \\n\\n‘I  shall  get  myself  a  bit  into  training,  too,’  he  said,  looking \\n\\n\\n90 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nat  himself  in  a  dusty  mirror  in  the  half-empty  hall.  He  had \\nnot  done  any  strenuous  walking  for  a  long  time,  and  the \\nreflection  looked  rather  flabby,  he  thought. \\n\\nAfter  lunch,  the  Sackville-Bagginses,  Lobelia  and  her \\nsandy-haired  son,  Lotho,  turned  up,  much  to  Frodo’s  annoy¬ \\nance.  ‘Ours  at  last!’  said  Lobelia,  as  she  stepped  inside.  It  was \\nnot  polite;  nor  strictly  true,  for  the  sale  of  Bag  End  did  not \\ntake  effect  until  midnight.  But  Lobelia  can  perhaps  be  for¬ \\ngiven:  she  had  been  obliged  to  wait  about  seventy-seven  years \\nlonger  for  Bag  End  than  she  once  hoped,  and  she  was  now  a \\nhundred  years  old.  Anyway,  she  had  come  to  see  that  nothing \\nshe  had  paid  for  had  been  carried  off;  and  she  wanted  the \\nkeys.  It  took  a  long  while  to  satisfy  her,  as  she  had  brought  a \\ncomplete  inventory  with  her  and  went  right  through  it.  In  the \\nend  she  departed  with  Lotho  and  the  spare  key  and  the \\npromise  that  the  other  key  would  be  left  at  the  Gamgees’  in \\nBagshot  Row.  She  snorted,  and  showed  plainly  that  she \\nthought  the  Gamgees  capable  of  plundering  the  hole  during \\nthe  night.  Frodo  did  not  offer  her  any  tea. \\n\\nHe  took  his  own  tea  with  Pippin  and  Sam  Gamgee  in  the \\nkitchen.  It  had  been  officially  announced  that  Sam  was \\ncoming  to  Buckland  ‘to  do  for  Mr.  Frodo  and  look  after  his \\nbit  of  garden’;  an  arrangement  that  was  approved  by  the \\nGaffer,  though  it  did  not  console  him  for  the  prospect  of \\nhaving  Lobelia  as  a  neighbour. \\n\\n‘Our  last  meal  at  Bag  End!’  said  Frodo,  pushing  back  his \\nchair.  They  left  the  washing  up  for  Lobelia.  Pippin  and  Sam \\nstrapped  up  their  three  packs  and  piled  them  in  the  porch. \\nPippin  went  out  for  a  last  stroll  in  the  garden.  Sam  dis¬ \\nappeared. \\n\\nThe  sun  went  down.  Bag  End  seemed  sad  and  gloomy  and \\ndishevelled.  Frodo  wandered  round  the  familiar  rooms,  and \\nsaw  the  light  of  the  sunset  fade  on  the  walls,  and  shadows \\ncreep  out  of  the  corners.  It  grew  slowly  dark  indoors.  He \\nwent  out  and  walked  down  to  the  gate  at  the  bottom  of  the \\npath,  and  then  on  a  short  way  down  the  Hill  Road.  He  half \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\n91 \\n\\n\\nexpected  to  see  Gandalf  come  striding  up  through  the  dusk. \\n\\nThe  sky  was  clear  and  the  stars  were  growing  bright.  ‘It’s \\ngoing  to  be  a  fine  night,’  he  said  aloud.  ‘That’s  good  for  a \\nbeginning.  I  feel  like  walking.  I  can’t  bear  any  more  hanging \\nabout.  I  am  going  to  start,  and  Gandalf  must  follow  me.’  He \\nturned  to  go  back,  and  then  stopped,  for  he  heard  voices,  just \\nround  the  corner  by  the  end  of  Bagshot  Row.  One  voice  was \\ncertainly  the  old  Gaffer’s;  the  other  was  strange,  and  some¬ \\nhow  unpleasant.  He  could  not  make  out  what  it  said,  but  he \\nheard  the  Gaffer’s  answers,  which  were  rather  shrill.  The  old \\nman  seemed  put  out. \\n\\n‘No,  Mr.  Baggins  has  gone  away.  Went  this  morning,  and \\nmy  Sam  went  with  him:  anyway  all  his  stuff  went.  Yes,  sold \\nout  and  gone,  I  tell’ee.  Why?  Why’s  none  of  my  business, \\nor  yours.  Where  to?  That  ain’t  no  secret.  He’s  moved  to \\nBucklebury  or  some  such  place,  away  down  yonder.  Yes  it  is \\n-  a  tidy  way.  I’ve  never  been  so  far  myself;  they’re  queer  folks \\nin  Buckland.  No,  I  can’t  give  no  message.  Good  night  to \\nyou!’ \\n\\nFootsteps  went  away  down  the  Hill.  Frodo  wondered \\nvaguely  why  the  fact  that  they  did  not  come  on  up  the  Hill \\nseemed  a  great  relief.  ‘I  am  sick  of  questions  and  curiosity \\nabout  my  doings,  I  suppose,’  he  thought.  What  an  inquisitive \\nlot  they  all  are!’  He  had  half  a  mind  to  go  and  ask  the  Gaffer \\nwho  the  inquirer  was;  but  he  thought  better  (or  worse)  of  it, \\nand  turned  and  walked  quickly  back  to  Bag  End. \\n\\nPippin  was  sitting  on  his  pack  in  the  porch.  Sam  was  not \\nthere.  Frodo  stepped  inside  the  dark  door.  ‘Sam!’  he  called. \\n‘Sam!  Time!’ \\n\\n‘Coming,  sir!’  came  the  answer  from  far  within,  followed \\nsoon  by  Sam  himself,  wiping  his  mouth.  He  had  been  saying \\nfarewell  to  the  beer-barrel  in  the  cellar. \\n\\n‘All  aboard,  Sam?’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Yes,  sir.  I’ll  last  for  a  bit  now,  sir.’ \\n\\nFrodo  shut  and  locked  the  round  door,  and  gave  the  key \\nto  Sam.  ‘Run  down  with  this  to  your  home,  Sam!’  he  said. \\n‘Then  cut  along  the  Row  and  meet  us  as  quick  as  you  can  at \\n\\n\\n92 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nthe  gate  in  the  lane  beyond  the  meadows.  We  are  not  going \\nthrough  the  village  tonight.  Too  many  ears  pricking  and  eyes \\nprying.’  Sam  ran  off  at  full  speed. \\n\\nWell,  now  we’re  off  at  last!’  said  Frodo.  They  shouldered \\ntheir  packs  and  took  up  their  sticks,  and  walked  round  the \\ncorner  to  the  west  side  of  Bag  End.  ‘Good-bye!’  said  Frodo, \\nlooking  at  the  dark  blank  windows.  He  waved  his  hand,  and \\nthen  turned  and  (following  Bilbo,  if  he  had  known  it)  hurried \\nafter  Peregrin  down  the  garden-path.  They  jumped  over  the \\nlow  place  in  the  hedge  at  the  bottom  and  took  to  the  fields, \\npassing  into  the  darkness  like  a  rustle  in  the  grasses. \\n\\nAt  the  bottom  of  the  Hill  on  its  western  side  they  came  to \\nthe  gate  opening  on  to  a  narrow  lane.  There  they  halted  and \\nadjusted  the  straps  of  their  packs.  Presently  Sam  appeared, \\ntrotting  quickly  and  breathing  hard;  his  heavy  pack  was \\nhoisted  high  on  his  shoulders,  and  he  had  put  on  his  head  a \\ntall  shapeless  felt  bag,  which  he  called  a  hat.  In  the  gloom  he \\nlooked  very  much  like  a  dwarf. \\n\\n‘I  am  sure  you  have  given  me  all  the  heaviest  stuff,’  said \\nFrodo.  ‘I  pity  snails,  and  all  that  carry  their  homes  on  their \\nbacks.’ \\n\\n‘I  could  take  a  lot  more  yet,  sir.  My  packet  is  quite  light,’ \\nsaid  Sam  stoutly  and  untruthfully. \\n\\n‘No  you  don’t,  Sam!’  said  Pippin.  ‘It  is  good  for  him.  He’s \\ngot  nothing  except  what  he  ordered  us  to  pack.  He’s  been \\nslack  lately,  and  he’ll  feel  the  weight  less  when  he’s  walked \\noff  some  of  his  own.’ \\n\\n‘Be  land  to  a  poor  old  hobbit!’  laughed  Frodo.  ‘I  shall  be \\nas  thin  as  a  willow-wand,  I’m  sure,  before  I  get  to  Buckland. \\nBut  I  was  talking  nonsense.  I  suspect  you  have  taken  more \\nthan  your  share,  Sam,  and  I  shall  look  into  it  at  our  next \\npacking.’  He  picked  up  his  stick  again.  ‘Well,  we  all  like \\nwalking  in  the  dark,’  he  said,  ‘so  let’s  put  some  miles  behind \\nus  before  bed.’ \\n\\nFor  a  short  way  they  followed  the  lane  westwards.  Then \\nleaving  it  they  turned  left  and  took  quietly  to  the  fields  again. \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\n93 \\n\\n\\nThey  went  in  single  file  along  hedgerows  and  the  borders  of \\ncoppices,  and  night  fell  dark  about  them.  In  their  dark  cloaks \\nthey  were  as  invisible  as  if  they  all  had  magic  rings.  Since \\nthey  were  all  hobbits,  and  were  trying  to  be  silent,  they  made \\nno  noise  that  even  hobbits  would  hear.  Even  the  wild  things \\nin  the  fields  and  woods  hardly  noticed  their  passing. \\n\\nAfter  some  time  they  crossed  the  Water,  west  of  Hobbiton, \\nby  a  narrow  plank-bridge.  The  stream  was  there  no  more  than \\na  winding  black  ribbon,  bordered  with  leaning  alder-trees.  A \\nmile  or  two  further  south  they  hastily  crossed  the  great  road \\nfrom  the  Brandywine  Bridge;  they  were  now  in  the  Tookland \\nand  bending  south-eastwards  they  made  for  the  Green  Hill \\nCountry.  As  they  began  to  climb  its  first  slopes  they  looked \\nback  and  saw  the  lamps  in  Hobbiton  far  off  twinkling  in  the \\ngentle  valley  of  the  Water.  Soon  it  disappeared  in  the  folds \\nof  the  darkened  land,  and  was  followed  by  Bywater  beside  its \\ngrey  pool.  When  the  light  of  the  last  farm  was  far  behind, \\npeeping  among  the  trees,  Frodo  turned  and  waved  a  hand  in \\nfarewell. \\n\\n‘I  wonder  if  I  shall  ever  look  down  into  that  valley  again,’ \\nhe  said  quietly. \\n\\nWhen  they  had  walked  for  about  three  hours  they  rested. \\nThe  night  was  clear,  cool,  and  starry,  but  smoke-like  wisps \\nof  mist  were  creeping  up  the  hill-sides  from  the  streams  and \\ndeep  meadows.  Thin-clad  birches,  swaying  in  a  light  wind \\nabove  their  heads,  made  a  black  net  against  the  pale  sky. \\nThey  ate  a  very  frugal  supper  (for  hobbits),  and  then  went \\non  again.  Soon  they  struck  a  narrow  road,  that  went  rolling \\nup  and  down,  fading  grey  into  the  darkness  ahead:  the  road \\nto  Woodhall,  and  Stock,  and  the  Bucklebury  Ferry.  It  climbed \\naway  from  the  main  road  in  the  Water-valley,  and  wound \\nover  the  skirts  of  the  Green  Hills  towards  Woody  End,  a  wild \\ncorner  of  the  Eastfarthing. \\n\\nAfter  a  while  they  plunged  into  a  deeply  cloven  track \\nbetween  tall  trees  that  rustled  their  dry  leaves  in  the  night.  It \\nwas  very  dark.  At  first  they  talked,  or  hummed  a  tune  softly \\ntogether,  being  now  far  away  from  inquisitive  ears.  Then  they \\n\\n\\n94 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nmarched  on  in  silence,  and  Pippin  began  to  lag  behind.  At \\nlast,  as  they  began  to  climb  a  steep  slope,  he  stopped  and \\nyawned. \\n\\n‘I  am  so  sleepy,’  he  said,  ‘that  soon  I  shall  fall  down  on \\nthe  road.  Are  you  going  to  sleep  on  your  legs?  It  is  nearly \\nmidnight.’ \\n\\n‘I  thought  you  liked  walking  in  the  dark,’  said  Frodo.  ‘But \\nthere  is  no  great  hurry.  Merry  expects  us  some  time  the  day \\nafter  tomorrow;  but  that  leaves  us  nearly  two  days  more. \\nWe’ll  halt  at  the  first  likely  spot.’ \\n\\n‘The  wind’s  in  the  West,’  said  Sam.  ‘If  we  get  to  the  other \\nside  of  this  hill,  we  shall  find  a  spot  that  is  sheltered  and  snug \\nenough,  sir.  There  is  a  dry  fir-wood  just  ahead,  if  I  remember \\nrightly.’  Sam  knew  the  land  well  within  twenty  miles  of \\nHobbiton,  but  that  was  the  limit  of  his  geography. \\n\\nJust  over  the  top  of  the  hill  they  came  on  the  patch  of \\nfir-wood.  Leaving  the  road  they  went  into  the  deep  resin- \\nscented  darkness  of  the  trees,  and  gathered  dead  sticks  and \\ncones  to  make  a  fire.  Soon  they  had  a  merry  crackle  of  flame \\nat  the  foot  of  a  large  fir-tree  and  they  sat  round  it  for  a  while, \\nuntil  they  began  to  nod.  Then,  each  in  an  angle  of  the  great \\ntree’s  roots,  they  curled  up  in  their  cloaks  and  blankets,  and \\nwere  soon  fast  asleep.  They  set  no  watch;  even  Frodo  feared \\nno  danger  yet,  for  they  were  still  in  the  heart  of  the  Shire.  A \\nfew  creatures  came  and  looked  at  them  when  the  fire  had \\ndied  away.  A  fox  passing  through  the  wood  on  business  of \\nhis  own  stopped  several  minutes  and  sniffed. \\n\\n‘Hobbits!’  he  thought.  ‘Well,  what  next?  I  have  heard  of \\nstrange  doings  in  this  land,  but  I  have  seldom  heard  of  a \\nhobbit  sleeping  out  of  doors  under  a  tree.  Three  of  them! \\nThere’s  something  mighty  queer  behind  this.’  He  was  quite \\nright,  but  he  never  found  out  any  more  about  it. \\n\\nThe  morning  came,  pale  and  clammy.  Frodo  woke  up  first, \\nand  found  that  a  tree-root  had  made  a  hole  in  his  back,  and \\nthat  his  neck  was  stiff.  ‘Walking  for  pleasure!  Why  didn’t  I \\ndrive?’  he  thought,  as  he  usually  did  at  the  beginning  of  an \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\n95 \\n\\n\\nexpedition.  ‘And  all  my  beautiful  feather  beds  are  sold  to  the \\nSackville-Bagginses!  These  tree-roots  would  do  them  good.’ \\nHe  stretched.  ‘Wake  up,  hobbits!’  he  cried.  ‘It’s  a  beautiful \\nmorning.’ \\n\\n‘What’s  beautiful  about  it?’  said  Pippin,  peering  over  the \\nedge  of  his  blanket  with  one  eye.  ‘Sam!  Get  breakfast  ready \\nfor  half-past  nine!  Have  you  got  the  bath-water  hot?’ \\n\\nSam  jumped  up,  looking  rather  bleary.  ‘No,  sir,  I  haven’t, \\nsir!’  he  said. \\n\\nFrodo  stripped  the  blankets  from  Pippin  and  rolled  him \\nover,  and  then  walked  off  to  the  edge  of  the  wood.  Away \\neastward  the  sun  was  rising  red  out  of  the  mists  that  lay  thick \\non  the  world.  Touched  with  gold  and  red  the  autumn  trees \\nseemed  to  be  sailing  rootless  in  a  shadowy  sea.  A  little  below \\nhim  to  the  left  the  road  ran  down  steeply  into  a  hollow  and \\ndisappeared. \\n\\nWhen  he  returned  Sam  and  Pippin  had  got  a  good  fire \\ngoing.  ‘Water!’  shouted  Pippin.  ‘Where’s  the  water?’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  keep  water  in  my  pockets,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘We  thought  you  had  gone  to  find  some,’  said  Pippin,  busy \\nsetting  out  the  food,  and  cups.  ‘You  had  better  go  now.’ \\n\\n‘You  can  come  too,’  said  Frodo,  ‘and  bring  all  the  water- \\nbottles.’  There  was  a  stream  at  the  foot  of  the  hill.  They  filled \\ntheir  bottles  and  the  small  camping  kettle  at  a  little  fall  where \\nthe  water  fell  a  few  feet  over  an  outcrop  of  grey  stone.  It  was \\nicy  cold;  and  they  spluttered  and  puffed  as  they  bathed  their \\nfaces  and  hands. \\n\\nWhen  their  breakfast  was  over,  and  their  packs  all  trussed \\nup  again,  it  was  after  ten  o’clock,  and  the  day  was  beginning \\nto  turn  fine  and  hot.  They  went  down  the  slope,  and  across \\nthe  stream  where  it  dived  under  the  road,  and  up  the  next \\nslope,  and  up  and  down  another  shoulder  of  the  hills;  and  by \\nthat  time  their  cloaks,  blankets,  water,  food,  and  other  gear \\nalready  seemed  a  heavy  burden. \\n\\nThe  day’s  march  promised  to  be  warm  and  tiring  work. \\nAfter  some  miles,  however,  the  road  ceased  to  roll  up  and \\ndown:  it  climbed  to  the  top  of  a  steep  bank  in  a  weary \\n\\n\\n96 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nzig-zagging  sort  of  way,  and  then  prepared  to  go  down  for \\nthe  last  time.  In  front  of  them  they  saw  the  lower  lands  dotted \\nwith  small  clumps  of  trees  that  melted  away  in  the  distance \\nto  a  brown  woodland  haze.  They  were  looking  across  the \\nWoody  End  towards  the  Brandywine  River.  The  road  wound \\naway  before  them  like  a  piece  of  string. \\n\\n‘The  road  goes  on  for  ever,’  said  Pippin;  ‘but  I  can’t  with¬ \\nout  a  rest.  It  is  high  time  for  lunch.’  He  sat  down  on  the  bank \\nat  the  side  of  the  road  and  looked  away  east  into  the  haze, \\nbeyond  which  lay  the  River,  and  the  end  of  the  Shire  in  which \\nhe  had  spent  all  his  life.  Sam  stood  by  him.  His  round  eyes \\nwere  wide  open  -  for  he  was  looking  across  lands  he  had \\nnever  seen  to  a  new  horizon. \\n\\n‘Do  Elves  live  in  those  woods?’  he  asked. \\n\\n‘Not  that  I  ever  heard,’  said  Pippin.  Frodo  was  silent.  He \\ntoo  was  gazing  eastward  along  the  road,  as  if  he  had  never \\nseen  it  before.  Suddenly  he  spoke,  aloud  but  as  if  to  himself, \\nsaying  slowly: \\n\\nThe  Road  goes  ever  on  and  on \\nDown  from  the  door  where  it  began. \\n\\nNow  far  ahead  the  Road  has  gone, \\n\\nAnd  I  must  follow,  if  I  can, \\n\\nPursuing  it  with  weary  feet, \\n\\nUntil  it  joins  some  larger  way, \\n\\nWhere  many  paths  and  errands  meet. \\n\\nAnd  whither  then?  I  cannot  say. \\n\\n‘That  sounds  like  a  bit  of  old  Bilbo’s  rhyming,’  said  Pippin. \\n‘Or  is  it  one  of  your  imitations?  It  does  not  sound  altogether \\nencouraging.’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know,’  said  Frodo.  ‘It  came  to  me  then,  as  if  I  was \\nmaking  it  up;  but  I  may  have  heard  it  long  ago.  Certainly  it \\nreminds  me  very  much  of  Bilbo  in  the  last  years,  before  he \\nwent  away.  He  used  often  to  say  there  was  only  one  Road; \\nthat  it  was  like  a  great  river:  its  springs  were  at  every  doorstep, \\nand  every  path  was  its  tributary.  “It’s  a  dangerous  business, \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\n97 \\n\\n\\nFrodo,  going  out  of  your  door,”  he  used  to  say.  “You  step \\ninto  the  Road,  and  if  you  don’t  keep  your  feet,  there  is  no \\nknowing  where  you  might  be  swept  off  to.  Do  you  realize \\nthat  this  is  the  very  path  that  goes  through  Mirkwood,  and \\nthat  if  you  let  it,  it  might  take  you  to  the  Lonely  Mountain \\nor  even  further  and  to  worse  places?”  He  used  to  say  that  on \\nthe  path  outside  the  front  door  at  Bag  End,  especially  after \\nhe  had  been  out  for  a  long  walk.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  the  Road  won’t  sweep  me  anywhere  for  an  hour  at \\nleast,’  said  Pippin,  unslinging  his  pack.  The  others  followed \\nhis  example,  putting  their  packs  against  the  bank  and  their \\nlegs  out  into  the  road.  After  a  rest  they  had  a  good  lunch, \\nand  then  more  rest. \\n\\nThe  sun  was  beginning  to  get  low  and  the  light  of  afternoon \\nwas  on  the  land  as  they  went  down  the  hill.  So  far  they  had \\nnot  met  a  soul  on  the  road.  This  way  was  not  much  used, \\nbeing  hardly  fit  for  carts,  and  there  was  little  traffic  to  the \\nWoody  End.  They  had  been  jogging  along  again  for  an  hour \\nor  more  when  Sam  stopped  a  moment  as  if  listening.  They \\nwere  now  on  level  ground,  and  the  road  after  much  winding \\nlay  straight  ahead  through  grass-land  sprinkled  with  tall  trees, \\noutliers  of  the  approaching  woods. \\n\\n‘I  can  hear  a  pony  or  a  horse  coming  along  the  road \\nbehind,’  said  Sam. \\n\\nThey  looked  back,  but  the  turn  of  the  road  prevented  them \\nfrom  seeing  far.  ‘I  wonder  if  that  is  Gandalf  coming  after  us,’ \\nsaid  Frodo;  but  even  as  he  said  it,  he  had  a  feeling  that  it  was \\nnot  so,  and  a  sudden  desire  to  hide  from  the  view  of  the  rider \\ncame  over  him. \\n\\n‘It  may  not  matter  much,’  he  said  apologetically,  ‘but \\nI  would  rather  not  be  seen  on  the  road  -  by  anyone.  I  am \\nsick  of  my  doings  being  noticed  and  discussed.  And  if  it  is \\nGandalf,’  he  added  as  an  afterthought,  ‘we  can  give  him  a \\nlittle  surprise,  to  pay  him  out  for  being  so  late.  Let’s  get  out \\nof  sight!’ \\n\\nThe  other  two  ran  quickly  to  the  left  and  down  into  a  little \\n\\n\\n98 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nhollow  not  far  from  the  road.  There  they  lay  flat.  Frodo \\nhesitated  for  a  second:  curiosity  or  some  other  feeling  was \\nstruggling  with  his  desire  to  hide.  The  sound  of  hoofs  drew \\nnearer.  Just  in  time  he  threw  himself  down  in  a  patch  of  long \\ngrass  behind  a  tree  that  overshadowed  the  road.  Then  he \\nlifted  his  head  and  peered  cautiously  above  one  of  the  great \\nroots. \\n\\nRound  the  corner  came  a  black  horse,  no  hobbit-pony  but \\na  full-sized  horse;  and  on  it  sat  a  large  man,  who  seemed  to \\ncrouch  in  the  saddle,  wrapped  in  a  great  black  cloak  and \\nhood,  so  that  only  his  boots  in  the  high  stirrups  showed \\nbelow;  his  face  was  shadowed  and  invisible. \\n\\nWhen  it  reached  the  tree  and  was  level  with  Frodo  the \\nhorse  stopped.  The  riding  figure  sat  quite  still  with  its  head \\nbowed,  as  if  listening.  From  inside  the  hood  came  a  noise  as \\nof  someone  sniffing  to  catch  an  elusive  scent;  the  head  turned \\nfrom  side  to  side  of  the  road. \\n\\nA  sudden  unreasoning  fear  of  discovery  laid  hold  of  Frodo, \\nand  he  thought  of  his  Ring.  He  hardly  dared  to  breathe,  and \\nyet  the  desire  to  get  it  out  of  his  pocket  became  so  strong  that \\nhe  began  slowly  to  move  his  hand.  He  felt  that  he  had  only \\nto  slip  it  on,  and  then  he  would  be  safe.  The  advice  of  Gandalf \\nseemed  absurd.  Bilbo  had  used  the  Ring.  ‘And  I  am  still  in \\nthe  Shire,’  he  thought,  as  his  hand  touched  the  chain  on \\nwhich  it  hung.  At  that  moment  the  rider  sat  up,  and  shook \\nthe  reins.  The  horse  stepped  forward,  walking  slowly  at  first, \\nand  then  breaking  into  a  quick  trot. \\n\\nFrodo  crawled  to  the  edge  of  the  road  and  watched  the \\nrider,  until  he  dwindled  into  the  distance.  He  could  not  be \\nquite  sure,  but  it  seemed  to  him  that  suddenly,  before  it \\npassed  out  of  sight,  the  horse  turned  aside  and  went  into  the \\ntrees  on  the  right. \\n\\nWell,  I  call  that  very  queer,  and  indeed  disturbing,’  said \\nFrodo  to  himself,  as  he  walked  towards  his  companions. \\nPippin  and  Sam  had  remained  flat  in  the  grass,  and  had \\nseen  nothing;  so  Frodo  described  the  rider  and  his  strange \\nbehaviour. \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\n99 \\n\\n\\n‘I  can’t  say  why,  but  I  felt  certain  he  was  looking  or  smelling \\nfor  me;  and  also  I  felt  certain  that  I  did  not  want  him  to \\ndiscover  me.  I’ve  never  seen  or  felt  anything  like  it  in  the \\nShire  before.’ \\n\\n‘But  what  has  one  of  the  Big  People  got  to  do  with  us?’ \\nsaid  Pippin.  ‘And  what  is  he  doing  in  this  part  of  the  world?’ \\n\\n‘There  are  some  Men  about,’  said  Frodo.  ‘Down  in  the \\nSouthfarthing  they  have  had  trouble  with  Big  People,  I \\nbelieve.  But  I  have  never  heard  of  anything  like  this  rider. \\nI  wonder  where  he  comes  from.’ \\n\\n‘Begging  your  pardon,’  put  in  Sam  suddenly,  ‘I  know \\nwhere  he  comes  from.  It’s  from  Hobbiton  that  this  here  black \\nrider  comes,  unless  there’s  more  than  one.  And  I  know  where \\nhe’s  going  to.’ \\n\\n‘What  do  you  mean?’  said  Frodo  sharply,  looking  at  him \\nin  astonishment.  ‘Why  didn’t  you  speak  up  before?’ \\n\\n‘I  have  only  just  remembered,  sir.  It  was  like  this:  when  I \\ngot  back  to  our  hole  yesterday  evening  with  the  key,  my  dad, \\nhe  says  to  me:  Hallo,  Sam!  he  says.  I  thought  you  were  away \\nwith  Mr.  Frodo  this  morning.  There’s  been  a  strange  customer \\nasking  for  Mr.  Baggins  of  Bag  End,  and  he’s  only  just  gone.  Eve \\nsent  him  on  to  Bucklebury.  Not  that  I  liked  the  sound  of  him.  He \\nseemed  mighty  put  out,  when  I  told  him  Mr.  Baggins  had  left  his \\nold  home  for  good.  Hissed  at  me,  he  did.  It  gave  me  quite  a \\nshudder.  What  sort  of  a  fellow  was  he?  says  I  to  the  Gaffer.  / \\ndon’t  know ,  says  he;  but  he  wasn’t  a  hobbit.  He  was  tall  and \\nblack-like,  and  he  stooped  over  me.  I  reckon  it  was  one  of  the  Big \\nFolk  from  foreign  parts.  He  spoke  funny. \\n\\n‘I  couldn’t  stay  to  hear  more,  sir,  since  you  were  waiting; \\nand  I  didn’t  give  much  heed  to  it  myself.  The  Gaffer  is  getting \\nold,  and  more  than  a  bit  blind,  and  it  must  have  been  near \\ndark  when  this  fellow  come  up  the  Hill  and  found  him  taking \\nthe  air  at  the  end  of  our  Row.  I  hope  he  hasn’t  done  no  harm, \\nsir,  nor  me.’ \\n\\n‘The  Gaffer  can’t  be  blamed  anyway,’  said  Frodo.  ‘As  a \\nmatter  of  fact  I  heard  him  talking  to  a  stranger,  who  seemed \\nto  be  inquiring  for  me,  and  I  nearly  went  and  asked  him  who \\n\\n\\nIOO \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nit  was.  I  wish  I  had,  or  you  had  told  me  about  it  before.  I \\nmight  have  been  more  careful  on  the  road.’ \\n\\n‘Still,  there  may  be  no  connexion  between  this  rider  and \\nthe  Gaffer’s  stranger,’  said  Pippin.  ‘We  left  Hobbiton  secretly \\nenough,  and  I  don’t  see  how  he  could  have  followed  us.’ \\n\\n‘What  about  the  smelling,  sir?’  said  Sam.  ‘And  the  Gaffer \\nsaid  he  was  a  black  chap.’ \\n\\n‘I  wish  I  had  waited  for  Gandalf,’  Frodo  muttered.  ‘But \\nperhaps  it  would  only  have  made  matters  worse.’ \\n\\n‘Then  you  know  or  guess  something  about  this  rider?’  said \\nPippin,  who  had  caught  the  muttered  words. \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know,  and  I  would  rather  not  guess,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘All  right,  cousin  Frodo!  You  can  keep  your  secret  for  the \\npresent,  if  you  want  to  be  mysterious.  In  the  meanwhile  what \\nare  we  to  do?  I  should  like  a  bite  and  a  sup,  but  somehow  I \\nthink  we  had  better  move  on  from  here.  Your  talk  of  sniffing \\nriders  with  invisible  noses  has  unsettled  me.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  I  think  we  will  move  on  now,’  said  Frodo;  ‘but  not \\non  the  road  -  in  case  that  rider  comes  back,  or  another  follows \\nhim.  We  ought  to  do  a  good  step  more  today.  Buckland  is \\nstill  miles  away.’ \\n\\nThe  shadows  of  the  trees  were  long  and  thin  on  the  grass, \\nas  they  started  off  again.  They  now  kept  a  stone’s  throw  to \\nthe  left  of  the  road,  and  kept  out  of  sight  of  it  as  much  as \\nthey  could.  But  this  hindered  them;  for  the  grass  was  thick \\nand  tussocky,  and  the  ground  uneven,  and  the  trees  began  to \\ndraw  together  into  thickets. \\n\\nThe  sun  had  gone  down  red  behind  the  hills  at  their  backs, \\nand  evening  was  coming  on  before  they  came  back  to  the \\nroad  at  the  end  of  the  long  level  over  which  it  had  run  straight \\nfor  some  miles.  At  that  point  it  bent  left  and  went  down  into \\nthe  lowlands  of  the  Yale  making  for  Stock;  but  a  lane \\nbranched  right,  winding  through  a  wood  of  ancient  oak-trees \\non  its  way  to  Woodhall.  ‘That  is  the  way  for  us,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\nNot  far  from  the  road-meeting  they  came  on  the  huge  hulk \\nof  a  tree:  it  was  still  alive  and  had  leaves  on  the  small  branches \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\nIOI \\n\\n\\nthat  it  had  put  out  round  the  broken  stumps  of  its  long-fallen \\nlimbs;  but  it  was  hollow,  and  could  be  entered  by  a  great \\ncrack  on  the  side  away  from  the  road.  The  hobbits  crept \\ninside,  and  sat  there  upon  a  floor  of  old  leaves  and  decayed \\nwood.  They  rested  and  had  a  light  meal,  talking  quietly  and \\nlistening  from  time  to  time. \\n\\nTwilight  was  about  them  as  they  crept  back  to  the  lane. \\nThe  West  wind  was  sighing  in  the  branches.  Leaves  were \\nwhispering.  Soon  the  road  began  to  fall  gently  but  steadily \\ninto  the  dusk.  A  star  came  out  above  the  trees  in  the  darkening \\nEast  before  them.  They  went  abreast  and  in  step,  to  keep  up \\ntheir  spirits.  After  a  time,  as  the  stars  grew  thicker  and \\nbrighter,  the  feeling  of  disquiet  left  them,  and  they  no  longer \\nlistened  for  the  sound  of  hoofs.  They  began  to  hum  softly, \\nas  hobbits  have  a  way  of  doing  as  they  walk  along,  especially \\nwhen  they  are  drawing  near  to  home  at  night.  With  most \\nhobbits  it  is  a  supper-song  or  a  bed-song;  but  these  hobbits \\nhummed  a  walking-song  (though  not,  of  course,  without  any \\nmention  of  supper  and  bed).  Bilbo  Baggins  had  made  the \\nwords,  to  a  tune  that  was  as  old  as  the  hills,  and  taught  it  to \\nFrodo  as  they  walked  in  the  lanes  of  the  Water- valley  and \\ntalked  about  Adventure. \\n\\nUpon  the  hearth  the  fire  is  red, \\n\\nBeneath  the  roof  there  is  a  bed; \\n\\nBut  not  yet  weary  are  our  feet. \\n\\nStill  round  the  corner  we  may  meet \\nA  sudden  tree  or  standing  stone \\nThat  none  have  seen  but  we  alone. \\n\\nTree  and  flower  and  leaf  and  grass, \\n\\nLet  them  pass!  Let  them  pass! \\n\\nHill  and  water  under  sky, \\n\\nPass  them  by!  Pass  them  by! \\n\\nStill  round  the  corner  there  may  wait \\nA  new  road  or  a  secret  gate, \\n\\nAnd  though  we  pass  them  by  today. \\n\\n\\n102 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nTomorrow  we  may  come  this  way \\nAnd  take  the  hidden  paths  that  run \\nTowards  the  Moon  or  to  the  Sun. \\n\\nApple,  thorn,  and  nut  and  sloe, \\n\\nLet  them  go!  Let  them  go! \\n\\nSand  and  stone  and  pool  and  dell, \\n\\nFare  you  well!  Fare  you  well! \\n\\nHome  is  behind,  the  world  ahead, \\n\\nAnd  there  are  many  paths  to  tread \\nThrough  shadows  to  the  edge  of  night, \\n\\nUntil  the  stars  are  all  alight. \\n\\nThen  world  behind  and  home  ahead, \\n\\nWe’ll  wander  back  to  home  and  bed. \\n\\nMist  and  twilight,  cloud  and  shade, \\n\\nAway  shall  fade!  Away  shall  fade! \\n\\nFire  and  lamp,  and  meat  and  bread, \\n\\nAnd  then  to  bed!  And  then  to  bed! \\n\\nThe  song  ended.  ‘And  now  to  bed!  And  now  to  bed!’  sang \\nPippin  in  a  high  voice. \\n\\n‘Hush!’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  think  I  hear  hoofs  again.’ \\n\\nThey  stopped  suddenly  and  stood  as  silent  as  tree- \\nshadows,  listening.  There  was  a  sound  of  hoofs  in  the  lane, \\nsome  way  behind,  but  coming  slow  and  clear  down  the  wind. \\nQuickly  and  quietly  they  slipped  off  the  path,  and  ran  into \\nthe  deeper  shade  under  the  oak-trees. \\n\\n‘Don’t  let  us  go  too  far!’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  don’t  want  to  be \\nseen,  but  I  want  to  see  if  it  is  another  Black  Rider.’ \\n\\n‘Very  well!’  said  Pippin.  ‘But  don’t  forget  the  sniffing!’ \\n\\nThe  hoofs  drew  nearer.  They  had  no  time  to  find  any \\nhiding-place  better  than  the  general  darkness  under  the  trees; \\nSam  and  Pippin  crouched  behind  a  large  tree-bole,  while \\nFrodo  crept  back  a  few  yards  towards  the  lane.  It  showed \\ngrey  and  pale,  a  line  of  fading  light  through  the  wood.  Above \\nit  the  stars  were  thick  in  the  dim  sky,  but  there  was  no  moon. \\n\\nThe  sound  of  hoofs  stopped.  As  Frodo  watched  he  saw \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\n103 \\n\\n\\nsomething  dark  pass  across  the  lighter  space  between  two \\ntrees,  and  then  halt.  It  looked  like  the  black  shade  of  a  horse \\nled  by  a  smaller  black  shadow.  The  black  shadow  stood  close \\nto  the  point  where  they  had  left  the  path,  and  it  swayed  from \\nside  to  side.  Frodo  thought  he  heard  the  sound  of  snuffling. \\nThe  shadow  bent  to  the  ground,  and  then  began  to  crawl \\ntowards  him. \\n\\nOnce  more  the  desire  to  slip  on  the  Ring  came  over  Frodo; \\nbut  this  time  it  was  stronger  than  before.  So  strong  that, \\nalmost  before  he  realized  what  he  was  doing,  his  hand  was \\ngroping  in  his  pocket.  But  at  that  moment  there  came  a  sound \\nlike  mingled  song  and  laughter.  Clear  voices  rose  and  fell \\nin  the  starlit  air.  The  black  shadow  straightened  up  and \\nretreated.  It  climbed  on  to  the  shadowy  horse  and  seemed  to \\nvanish  across  the  lane  into  the  darkness  on  the  other  side. \\nFrodo  breathed  again. \\n\\n‘Elves!’  exclaimed  Sam  in  a  hoarse  whisper.  ‘Elves,  sir!’  He \\nwould  have  burst  out  of  the  trees  and  dashed  off  towards  the \\nvoices,  if  they  had  not  pulled  him  back. \\n\\n‘Yes,  it  is  Elves,’  said  Frodo.  ‘One  can  meet  them  some¬ \\ntimes  in  the  Woody  End.  They  don’t  live  in  the  Shire,  but \\nthey  wander  into  it  in  spring  and  autumn,  out  of  their  own \\nlands  away  beyond  the  Tower  Hills.  I  am  thankful  that  they \\ndo!  You  did  not  see,  but  that  Black  Rider  stopped  just  here \\nand  was  actually  crawling  towards  us  when  the  song  began. \\nAs  soon  as  he  heard  the  voices  he  slipped  away.’ \\n\\n‘What  about  the  Elves?’  said  Sam,  too  excited  to  trouble \\nabout  the  rider.  ‘Can’t  we  go  and  see  them?’ \\n\\n‘Listen!  They  are  coming  this  way,’  said  Frodo.  We  have \\nonly  to  wait.’ \\n\\nThe  singing  drew  nearer.  One  clear  voice  rose  now  above \\nthe  others.  It  was  singing  in  the  fair  elven- tongue,  of  which \\nFrodo  knew  only  a  little,  and  the  others  knew  nothing.  Yet \\nthe  sound  blending  with  the  melody  seemed  to  shape  itself \\nin  their  thought  into  words  which  they  only  partly  under¬ \\nstood.  This  was  the  song  as  Frodo  heard  it: \\n\\n\\n104  THE  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nSnow-white!  Snow-white!  O  Lady  clear! \\n\\nO  Queen  beyond  the  Western  Seas! \\n\\nO  Light  to  us  that  wander  here \\nAmid  the  world  of  woven  trees! \\n\\nGilthoniel!  O  Elbereth! \\n\\nClear  are  thy  eyes  and  bright  thy  breath! \\n\\nSnow-white!  Snow-white!  We  sing  to  thee \\nIn  a  far  land  beyond  the  Sea. \\n\\nO  stars  that  in  the  Sunless  Year \\n\\nWith  shining  hand  by  her  were  sown, \\n\\nIn  windy  fields  now  bright  and  clear \\nWe  see  your  silver  blossom  blown! \\n\\nO  Elbereth!  Gilthoniel! \\n\\nWe  still  remember,  we  who  dwell \\n\\nIn  this  far  land  beneath  the  trees, \\n\\nThy  starlight  on  the  Western  Seas. \\n\\nThe  song  ended.  ‘These  are  High  Elves!  They  spoke  the \\nname  of  Elbereth!’  said  Frodo  in  amazement.  ‘Few  of  that \\nfairest  folic  are  ever  seen  in  the  Shire.  Not  many  now  remain \\nin  Middle-earth,  east  of  the  Great  Sea.  This  is  indeed  a \\nstrange  chance!’ \\n\\nThe  hobbits  sat  in  shadow  by  the  wayside.  Before  long  the \\nElves  came  down  the  lane  towards  the  valley.  They  passed \\nslowly,  and  the  hobbits  could  see  the  starlight  glimmering  on \\ntheir  hair  and  in  their  eyes.  They  bore  no  lights,  yet  as  they \\nwalked  a  shimmer,  like  the  light  of  the  moon  above  the  rim \\nof  the  hills  before  it  rises,  seemed  to  fall  about  their  feet.  They \\nwere  now  silent,  and  as  the  last  Elf  passed  he  turned  and \\nlooked  towards  the  hobbits  and  laughed. \\n\\n‘Hail,  Frodo!’  he  cried.  ‘You  are  abroad  late.  Or  are  you \\nperhaps  lost?’  Then  he  called  aloud  to  the  others,  and  all  the \\ncompany  stopped  and  gathered  round. \\n\\n‘This  is  indeed  wonderful!’  they  said.  ‘Three  hobbits  in  a \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY  105 \\n\\nwood  at  night!  We  have  not  seen  such  a  thing  since  Bilbo \\nwent  away.  What  is  the  meaning  of  it?’ \\n\\n‘The  meaning  of  it,  fair  people,’  said  Frodo,  ‘is  simply  that \\nwe  seem  to  be  going  the  same  way  as  you  are.  I  like  walking \\nunder  the  stars.  But  I  would  welcome  your  company.’ \\n\\n‘But  we  have  no  need  of  other  company,  and  hobbits  are \\nso  dull,’  they  laughed.  ‘And  how  do  you  know  that  we  go  the \\nsame  way  as  you,  for  you  do  not  know  whither  we  are  going?’ \\n\\n‘And  how  do  you  know  my  name?’  asked  Frodo  in  return. \\n\\n‘We  know  many  things,’  they  said.  We  have  seen  you \\noften  before  with  Bilbo,  though  you  may  not  have  seen  us.’ \\n\\nWho  are  you,  and  who  is  your  lord?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘I  am  Gildor,’  answered  their  leader,  the  Elf  who  had  first \\nhailed  him.  ‘Gildor  Inglorion  of  the  House  of  Finrod.  We  are \\nExiles,  and  most  of  our  kindred  have  long  ago  departed  and \\nwe  too  are  now  only  tarrying  here  a  while,  ere  we  return  over \\nthe  Great  Sea.  But  some  of  our  kinsfolk  dwell  still  in  peace \\nin  Rivendell.  Come  now,  Frodo,  tell  us  what  you  are  doing? \\nFor  we  see  that  there  is  some  shadow  of  fear  upon  you.’ \\n\\n‘O  Wise  People!’  interrupted  Pippin  eagerly.  ‘Tell  us  about \\nthe  Black  Riders!’ \\n\\n‘Black  Riders?’  they  said  in  low  voices.  ‘Why  do  you  ask \\nabout  Black  Riders?’ \\n\\n‘Because  two  Black  Riders  have  overtaken  us  today,  or  one \\nhas  done  so  twice,’  said  Pippin;  ‘only  a  little  while  ago  he \\nslipped  away  as  you  drew  near.’ \\n\\nThe  Elves  did  not  answer  at  once,  but  spoke  together  softly \\nin  their  own  tongue.  At  length  Gildor  turned  to  the  hobbits. \\nWe  will  not  speak  of  this  here,’  he  said.  ‘We  think  you  had \\nbest  come  now  with  us.  It  is  not  our  custom,  but  for  this  time \\nwe  will  take  you  on  our  road,  and  you  shall  lodge  with  us \\ntonight,  if  you  will.’ \\n\\n‘O  Fair  Folic!  This  is  good  fortune  beyond  my  hope,’  said \\nPippin.  Sam  was  speechless.  ‘I  thank  you  indeed,  Gildor \\nInglorion,’  said  Frodo  bowing.  ‘ Elen  sila  lumenn’  omentielvo, \\na  star  shines  on  the  hour  of  our  meeting,’  he  added  in  the \\nHigh-elven  speech. \\n\\n\\nio6 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Be  careful,  friends!’  cried  Gildor  laughing.  ‘Speak  no \\nsecrets!  Here  is  a  scholar  in  the  Ancient  Tongue.  Bilbo  was \\na  good  master.  Hail,  Elf-friend!’  he  said,  bowing  to  Frodo. \\n‘Come  now  with  your  friends  and  join  our  company!  You \\nhad  best  walk  in  the  middle  so  that  you  may  not  stray.  You \\nmay  be  weary  before  we  halt.’ \\n\\n‘Why?  Where  are  you  going?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘For  tonight  we  go  to  the  woods  on  the  hills  above  Wood- \\nhall.  It  is  some  miles,  but  you  shall  have  rest  at  the  end  of  it, \\nand  it  will  shorten  your  journey  tomorrow.’ \\n\\nThey  now  marched  on  again  in  silence,  and  passed  like \\nshadows  and  faint  lights:  for  Elves  (even  more  than  hobbits) \\ncould  walk  when  they  wished  without  sound  or  footfall. \\nPippin  soon  began  to  feel  sleepy,  and  staggered  once  or  twice; \\nbut  each  time  a  tall  Elf  at  his  side  put  out  his  arm  and  saved \\nhim  from  a  fall.  Sam  walked  along  at  Frodo’s  side,  as  if  in  a \\ndream,  with  an  expression  on  his  face  half  of  fear  and  half  of \\nastonished  joy. \\n\\nThe  woods  on  either  side  became  denser;  the  trees  were \\nnow  younger  and  thicker;  and  as  the  lane  went  lower,  running \\ndown  into  a  fold  of  the  hills,  there  were  many  deep  brakes  of \\nhazel  on  the  rising  slopes  at  either  hand.  At  last  the  Elves \\nturned  aside  from  the  path.  A  green  ride  lay  almost  unseen \\nthrough  the  thickets  on  the  right;  and  this  they  followed  as  it \\nwound  away  back  up  the  wooded  slopes  on  to  the  top  of \\na  shoulder  of  the  hills  that  stood  out  into  the  lower  land \\nof  the  river-valley.  Suddenly  they  came  out  of  the  shadow \\nof  the  trees,  and  before  them  lay  a  wide  space  of  grass, \\ngrey  under  the  night.  On  three  sides  the  woods  pressed \\nupon  it;  but  eastward  the  ground  fell  steeply  and  the  tops \\nof  the  dark  trees,  growing  at  the  bottom  of  the  slope,  were \\nbelow  their  feet.  Beyond,  the  low  lands  lay  dim  and  flat \\nunder  the  stars.  Nearer  at  hand  a  few  lights  twinkled  in  the \\nvillage  of  Woodhall. \\n\\nThe  Elves  sat  on  the  grass  and  spoke  together  in  soft  voices; \\nthey  seemed  to  take  no  further  notice  of  the  hobbits.  Frodo \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\n107 \\n\\n\\nand  his  companions  wrapped  themselves  in  cloaks  and \\nblankets,  and  drowsiness  stole  over  them.  The  night  grew  on, \\nand  the  lights  in  the  valley  went  out.  Pippin  fell  asleep, \\npillowed  on  a  green  hillock. \\n\\nAway  high  in  the  East  swung  Remmirath,  the  Netted  Stars, \\nand  slowly  above  the  mists  red  Borgil  rose,  glowing  like  a \\njewel  of  fire.  Then  by  some  shift  of  airs  all  the  mist  was  drawn \\naway  like  a  veil,  and  there  leaned  up,  as  he  climbed  over  the \\nrim  of  the  world,  the  Swordsman  of  the  Sky,  Menelvagor \\nwith  his  shining  belt.  The  Elves  all  burst  into  song.  Suddenly \\nunder  the  trees  a  fire  sprang  up  with  a  red  light. \\n\\n‘Come!’  the  Elves  called  to  the  hobbits.  ‘Come!  Now  is  the \\ntime  for  speech  and  merriment!’ \\n\\nPippin  sat  up  and  rubbed  his  eyes.  He  shivered.  ‘There  is \\na  fire  in  the  hall,  and  food  for  hungry  guests,’  said  an  Elf \\nstanding  before  him. \\n\\nAt  the  south  end  of  the  greensward  there  was  an  opening. \\nThere  the  green  floor  ran  on  into  the  wood,  and  formed  a \\nwide  space  like  a  hall,  roofed  by  the  boughs  of  trees.  Their \\ngreat  trunks  ran  like  pillars  down  each  side.  In  the  middle \\nthere  was  a  wood-fire  blazing,  and  upon  the  tree-pillars \\ntorches  with  lights  of  gold  and  silver  were  burning  steadily. \\nThe  Elves  sat  round  the  fire  upon  the  grass  or  upon  the  sawn \\nrings  of  old  trunks.  Some  went  to  and  fro  bearing  cups  and \\npouring  drink;  others  brought  food  on  heaped  plates  and \\ndishes. \\n\\n‘This  is  poor  fare,’  they  said  to  the  hobbits;  ‘for  we  are \\nlodging  in  the  greenwood  far  from  our  halls.  If  ever  you  are \\nour  guests  at  home,  we  will  treat  you  better.’ \\n\\n‘It  seems  to  me  good  enough  for  a  birthday-party,’  said \\nFrodo. \\n\\nPippin  afterwards  recalled  little  of  either  food  or  drink,  for \\nhis  mind  was  filled  with  the  light  upon  the  elf-faces,  and  the \\nsound  of  voices  so  various  and  so  beautiful  that  he  felt  in  a \\nwaking  dream.  But  he  remembered  that  there  was  bread, \\nsurpassing  the  savour  of  a  fair  white  loaf  to  one  who  is  starv¬ \\ning;  and  fruits  sweet  as  wildberries  and  richer  than  the  tended \\n\\n\\nio8 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nfruits  of  gardens;  he  drained  a  cup  that  was  filled  with  a \\nfragrant  draught,  cool  as  a  clear  fountain,  golden  as  a  summer \\nafternoon. \\n\\nSam  could  never  describe  in  words,  nor  picture  clearly  to \\nhimself,  what  he  felt  or  thought  that  night,  though  it  remained \\nin  his  memory  as  one  of  the  chief  events  of  his  life.  The \\nnearest  he  ever  got  was  to  say:  ‘Well,  sir,  if  I  could  grow \\napples  like  that,  I  would  call  myself  a  gardener.  But  it  was \\nthe  singing  that  went  to  my  heart,  if  you  know  what  I  mean.’ \\n\\nFrodo  sat,  eating,  drinking,  and  talking  with  delight;  but \\nhis  mind  was  chiefly  on  the  words  spoken.  He  knew  a  little \\nof  the  elf-speech  and  listened  eagerly.  Now  and  again  he \\nspoke  to  those  that  served  him  and  thanked  them  in  their \\nown  language.  They  smiled  at  him  and  said  laughing:  ‘Here \\nis  a  jewel  among  hobbits!’ \\n\\nAfter  a  while  Pippin  fell  fast  asleep,  and  was  lifted  up  and \\nborne  away  to  a  bower  under  the  trees;  there  he  was  laid \\nupon  a  soft  bed  and  slept  the  rest  of  the  night  away.  Sam \\nrefused  to  leave  his  master.  When  Pippin  had  gone,  he  came \\nand  sat  curled  up  at  Frodo’s  feet,  where  at  last  he  nodded \\nand  closed  his  eyes.  Frodo  remained  long  awake,  talking  with \\nGildor. \\n\\nThey  spoke  of  many  things,  old  and  new,  and  Frodo  ques¬ \\ntioned  Gildor  much  about  happenings  in  the  wide  world \\noutside  the  Shire.  The  tidings  were  mostly  sad  and  ominous: \\nof  gathering  darkness,  the  wars  of  Men,  and  the  flight  of  the \\nElves.  At  last  Frodo  asked  the  question  that  was  nearest  to \\nhis  heart: \\n\\n‘Tell  me,  Gildor,  have  you  ever  seen  Bilbo  since  he  left  us?’ \\n\\nGildor  smiled.  ‘Yes,’  he  answered.  ‘Twice.  He  said  farewell \\nto  us  on  this  very  spot.  But  I  saw  him  once  again,  far  from \\nhere.’  He  would  say  no  more  about  Bilbo,  and  Frodo  fell \\nsilent. \\n\\n‘You  do  not  ask  me  or  tell  me  much  that  concerns  yourself, \\nFrodo,’  said  Gildor.  ‘But  I  already  know  a  little,  and  I  can \\nread  more  in  your  face  and  in  the  thought  behind  your  ques- \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\n109 \\n\\n\\ntions.  You  are  leaving  the  Shire,  and  yet  you  doubt  that  you \\nwill  find  what  you  seek,  or  accomplish  what  you  intend,  or \\nthat  you  will  ever  return.  Is  not  that  so?’ \\n\\n‘It  is,’  said  Frodo;  ‘but  I  thought  my  going  was  a  secret \\nknown  only  to  Gandalf  and  my  faithful  Sam.’  He  looked \\ndown  at  Sam,  who  was  snoring  gently. \\n\\n‘The  secret  will  not  reach  the  Enemy  from  us,’  said  Gildor. \\n\\n‘The  Enemy?’  said  Frodo.  ‘Then  you  know  why  I  am \\nleaving  the  Shire?’ \\n\\n‘I  do  not  know  for  what  reason  the  Enemy  is  pursuing \\nyou,’  answered  Gildor;  ‘but  I  perceive  that  he  is  -  strange \\nindeed  though  that  seems  to  me.  And  I  warn  you  that  peril \\nis  now  both  before  you  and  behind  you,  and  upon  either \\nside.’ \\n\\n‘You  mean  the  Riders?  I  feared  that  they  were  servants  of \\nthe  Enemy.  What  are  the  Black  Riders?’ \\n\\n‘Has  Gandalf  told  you  nothing?’ \\n\\n‘Nothing  about  such  creatures.’ \\n\\n‘Then  I  think  it  is  not  for  me  to  say  more  -  lest  terror \\nshould  keep  you  from  your  journey.  For  it  seems  to  me  that \\nyou  have  set  out  only  just  in  time,  if  indeed  you  are  in  time. \\nYou  must  now  make  haste,  and  neither  stay  nor  turn  back; \\nfor  the  Shire  is  no  longer  any  protection  to  you.’ \\n\\n‘I  cannot  imagine  what  information  could  be  more  terrify¬ \\ning  than  your  hints  and  warnings,’  exclaimed  Frodo.  ‘I  knew \\nthat  danger  lay  ahead,  of  course;  but  I  did  not  expect  to  meet \\nit  in  our  own  Shire.  Can’t  a  hobbit  walk  from  the  Water  to \\nthe  River  in  peace?’ \\n\\n‘But  it  is  not  your  own  Shire,’  said  Gildor.  ‘Others  dwelt \\nhere  before  hobbits  were;  and  others  will  dwell  here  again \\nwhen  hobbits  are  no  more.  The  wide  world  is  all  about  you: \\nyou  can  fence  yourselves  in,  but  you  cannot  for  ever  fence \\nit  out.’ \\n\\n‘I  know  -  and  yet  it  has  always  seemed  so  safe  and  familiar. \\nWhat  can  I  do  now?  My  plan  was  to  leave  the  Shire  secretly, \\nand  make  my  way  to  Rivendell;  but  now  my  footsteps  are \\ndogged,  before  ever  I  get  to  Buckland.’ \\n\\n\\nno \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘I  think  you  should  still  follow  that  plan,’  said  Gildor.  ‘I  do \\nnot  think  the  Road  will  prove  too  hard  for  your  courage.  But \\nif  you  desire  clearer  counsel,  you  should  ask  Gandalf.  I  do \\nnot  know  the  reason  for  your  flight,  and  therefore  I  do  not \\nknow  by  what  means  your  pursuers  will  assail  you.  These \\nthings  Gandalf  must  know.  I  suppose  that  you  will  see  him \\nbefore  you  leave  the  Shire?’ \\n\\n‘I  hope  so.  But  that  is  another  thing  that  makes  me  anxious. \\nI  have  been  expecting  Gandalf  for  many  days.  He  was  to \\nhave  come  to  Hobbiton  at  the  latest  two  nights  ago;  but  he \\nhas  never  appeared.  Now  I  am  wondering  what  can  have \\nhappened.  Should  I  wait  for  him?’ \\n\\nGildor  was  silent  for  a  moment.  ‘I  do  not  like  this  news,’ \\nhe  said  at  last.  ‘That  Gandalf  should  be  late,  does  not  bode \\nwell.  But  it  is  said:  Do  not  meddle  in  the  affairs  of  Wizards ,  for \\nthey  are  subtle  and  quick  to  anger.  The  choice  is  yours:  to  go \\nor  wait.’ \\n\\n‘And  it  is  also  said,’  answered  Frodo:  ‘Go  not  to  the  Elves \\nfor  counsel,  for  they  will  say  both  no  and  yes.’ \\n\\n‘Is  it  indeed?’  laughed  Gildor.  ‘Elves  seldom  give  un¬ \\nguarded  advice,  for  advice  is  a  dangerous  gift,  even  from  the \\nwise  to  the  wise,  and  all  courses  may  run  ill.  But  what  would \\nyou?  You  have  not  told  me  all  concerning  yourself;  and  how \\nthen  shall  I  choose  better  than  you?  But  if  you  demand  advice, \\nI  will  for  friendship’s  sake  give  it.  I  think  you  should  now \\ngo  at  once,  without  delay;  and  if  Gandalf  does  not  come \\nbefore  you  set  out,  then  I  also  advise  this:  do  not  go  alone. \\nTake  such  friends  as  are  trusty  and  willing.  Now  you  should \\nbe  grateful,  for  I  do  not  give  this  counsel  gladly.  The  Elves \\nhave  their  own  labours  and  their  own  sorrows,  and  they  are \\nlittle  concerned  with  the  ways  of  hobbits,  or  of  any  other \\ncreatures  upon  earth.  Our  paths  cross  theirs  seldom,  by \\nchance  or  purpose.  In  this  meeting  there  may  be  more  than \\nchance;  but  the  purpose  is  not  clear  to  me,  and  I  fear  to  say \\ntoo  much.’ \\n\\n‘I  am  deeply  grateful,’  said  Frodo;  ‘but  I  wish  you  would \\ntell  me  plainly  what  the  Black  Riders  are.  If  I  take  your  advice \\n\\n\\nTHREE  IS  COMPANY \\n\\n\\nIII \\n\\n\\nI  may  not  see  Gandalf  for  a  long  while,  and  I  ought  to  know \\nwhat  is  the  danger  that  pursues  me.’ \\n\\n‘Is  it  not  enough  to  know  that  they  are  servants  of  the \\nEnemy?’  answered  Gildor.  ‘Flee  them!  Speak  no  words  to \\nthem!  They  are  deadly.  Ask  no  more  of  me!  But  my  heart \\nforbodes  that,  ere  all  is  ended,  you,  Frodo  son  of  Drogo,  will \\nknow  more  of  these  fell  things  than  Gildor  Inglorion.  May \\nElbereth  protect  you!’ \\n\\n‘But  where  shall  I  find  courage?’  asked  Frodo.  ‘That  is \\nwhat  I  chiefly  need.’ \\n\\n‘Courage  is  found  in  unlikely  places,’  said  Gildor.  ‘Be  of \\ngood  hope!  Sleep  now!  In  the  morning  we  shall  have  gone;  but \\nwe  will  send  our  messages  through  the  lands.  The  Wandering \\nCompanies  shall  know  of  your  journey,  and  those  that  have \\npower  for  good  shall  be  on  the  watch.  I  name  you  Elf-friend; \\nand  may  the  stars  shine  upon  the  end  of  your  road!  Seldom \\nhave  we  had  such  delight  in  strangers,  and  it  is  fair  to  hear \\nwords  of  the  Ancient  Speech  from  the  lips  of  other  wanderers \\nin  the  world.’ \\n\\nFrodo  felt  sleep  coming  upon  him,  even  as  Gildor  finished \\nspeaking.  ‘I  will  sleep  now,’  he  said;  and  the  Elf  led  him  to  a \\nbower  beside  Pippin,  and  he  threw  himself  upon  a  bed  and \\nfell  at  once  into  a  dreamless  slumber. \\n\\n\\nChapter  4 \\n\\n\\nA  SHORT  CUT  TO  MUSHROOMS \\n\\n\\nIn  the  morning  Frodo  woke  refreshed.  He  was  lying  in  a \\nbower  made  by  a  living  tree  with  branches  laced  and  drooping \\nto  the  ground;  his  bed  was  of  fern  and  grass,  deep  and  soft \\nand  strangely  fragrant.  The  sun  was  shining  through  the \\nfluttering  leaves,  which  were  still  green  upon  the  tree.  He \\njumped  up  and  went  out. \\n\\nSam  was  sitting  on  the  grass  near  the  edge  of  the  wood. \\nPippin  was  standing  studying  the  sky  and  weather.  There \\nwas  no  sign  of  the  Elves. \\n\\n‘They  have  left  us  fruit  and  drink,  and  bread,’  said  Pippin. \\n‘Come  and  have  your  breakfast.  The  bread  tastes  almost  as \\ngood  as  it  did  last  night.  I  did  not  want  to  leave  you  any,  but \\nSam  insisted.’ \\n\\nFrodo  sat  down  beside  Sam  and  began  to  eat.  ‘What  is  the \\nplan  for  today?’  asked  Pippin. \\n\\n‘To  walk  to  Bucklebury  as  quickly  as  possible,’  answered \\nFrodo,  and  gave  his  attention  to  the  food. \\n\\n‘Do  you  think  we  shall  see  anything  of  those  Riders?’  asked \\nPippin  cheerfully.  Under  the  morning  sun  the  prospect  of \\nseeing  a  whole  troop  of  them  did  not  seem  very  alarming  to \\nhim. \\n\\n‘Yes,  probably,’  said  Frodo,  not  liking  the  reminder.  ‘But \\nI  hope  to  get  across  the  river  without  their  seeing  us.’ \\n\\n‘Did  you  find  out  anything  about  them  from  Gildor?’ \\n\\n‘Not  much  -  only  hints  and  riddles,’  said  Frodo  evasively. \\n\\n‘Did  you  ask  about  the  sniffing?’ \\n\\n‘We  didn’t  discuss  it,’  said  Frodo  with  his  mouth  full. \\n\\n‘You  should  have.  I  am  sure  it  is  very  important.’ \\n\\n‘In  that  case  I  am  sure  Gildor  would  have  refused  to  explain \\nit,’  said  Frodo  sharply.  ‘And  now  leave  me  in  peace  for  a  bit! \\n\\n\\nA  SHORT  CUT  TO  MUSHROOMS  113 \\n\\nI  don’t  want  to  answer  a  string  of  questions  while  I  am  eating. \\nI  want  to  think!’ \\n\\n‘Good  heavens!’  said  Pippin.  ‘At  breakfast?’  He  walked \\naway  towards  the  edge  of  the  green. \\n\\nFrom  Frodo’s  mind  the  bright  morning  -  treacherously \\nbright,  he  thought  -  had  not  banished  the  fear  of  pursuit;  and \\nhe  pondered  the  words  of  Gildor.  The  merry  voice  of  Pippin \\ncame  to  him.  He  was  running  on  the  green  turf  and  singing. \\n\\n‘No!  I  could  not!’  he  said  to  himself.  ‘It  is  one  thing  to  take \\nmy  young  friends  walking  over  the  Shire  with  me,  until  we \\nare  hungry  and  weary,  and  food  and  bed  are  sweet.  To  take \\nthem  into  exile,  where  hunger  and  weariness  may  have  no \\ncure,  is  quite  another  -  even  if  they  are  willing  to  come.  The \\ninheritance  is  mine  alone.  I  don’t  think  I  ought  even  to  take \\nSam.’  He  looked  at  Sam  Gamgee,  and  discovered  that  Sam \\nwas  watching  him. \\n\\n‘Well,  Sam!’  he  said.  ‘What  about  it?  I  am  leaving  the  Shire \\nas  soon  as  ever  I  can  -  in  fact  I  have  made  up  my  mind  now \\nnot  even  to  wait  a  day  at  Crickhollow,  if  it  can  be  helped.’ \\n\\n‘Very  good,  sir!’ \\n\\n‘You  still  mean  to  come  with  me?’ \\n\\n‘I  do.’ \\n\\n‘It  is  going  to  be  very  dangerous,  Sam.  It  is  already  danger¬ \\nous.  Most  likely  neither  of  us  will  come  back.’ \\n\\n‘If  you  don’t  come  back,  sir,  then  I  shan’t,  that’s  certain,’ \\nsaid  Sam.  \\'Don’t  you  leave  him!  they  said  to  me.  Leave  him! \\nI  said.  I  never  mean  to.  I  am  going  with  him,  if  he  climbs  to  the \\nMoon ;  and  if  any  of  those  Black  Riders  try  to  stop  him,  they’ll \\nhave  Sam  Gamgee  to  reckon  with,  I  said.  They  laughed.’ \\n\\n‘Who  are  they,  and  what  are  you  talking  about?’ \\n\\n‘The  Elves,  sir.  We  had  some  talk  last  night;  and  they \\nseemed  to  know  you  were  going  away,  so  I  didn’t  see  the  use \\nof  denying  it.  Wonderful  folk,  Elves,  sir!  Wonderful!’ \\n\\n‘They  are,’  said  Frodo.  ‘Do  you  like  them  still,  now  you \\nhave  had  a  closer  view?’ \\n\\n‘They  seem  a  bit  above  my  likes  and  dislikes,  so  to  speak,’ \\nanswered  Sam  slowly.  ‘It  don’t  seem  to  matter  what  I  think \\n\\n\\n114  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nabout  them.  They  are  quite  different  from  what  I  expected  - \\nso  old  and  young,  and  so  gay  and  sad,  as  it  were.’ \\n\\nFrodo  looked  at  Sam  rather  startled,  half  expecting  to  see \\nsome  outward  sign  of  the  odd  change  that  seemed  to  have \\ncome  over  him.  It  did  not  sound  like  the  voice  of  the  old  Sam \\nGamgee  that  he  thought  he  knew.  But  it  looked  like  the  old \\nSam  Gamgee  sitting  there,  except  that  his  face  was  unusually \\nthoughtful. \\n\\n‘Do  you  feel  any  need  to  leave  the  Shire  now  -  now  that \\nyour  wish  to  see  them  has  come  true  already?’  he  asked. \\n\\n‘Yes,  sir.  I  don’t  know  how  to  say  it,  but  after  last  night \\nI  feel  different.  I  seem  to  see  ahead,  in  a  kind  of  way.  I  know \\nwe  are  going  to  take  a  very  long  road,  into  darkness;  but \\nI  know  I  can’t  turn  back.  It  isn’t  to  see  Elves  now,  nor \\ndragons,  nor  mountains,  that  I  want  -  I  don’t  rightly  know \\nwhat  I  want:  but  I  have  something  to  do  before  the  end,  and \\nit  lies  ahead,  not  in  the  Shire.  I  must  see  it  through,  sir,  if \\nyou  understand  me.’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  altogether.  But  I  understand  that  Gandalf  chose \\nme  a  good  companion.  I  am  content.  We  will  go  together.’ \\n\\nFrodo  finished  his  breakfast  in  silence.  Then  standing  up \\nhe  looked  over  the  land  ahead,  and  called  to  Pippin. \\n\\n‘All  ready  to  start?’  he  said  as  Pippin  ran  up.  ‘We  must  be \\ngetting  off  at  once.  We  slept  late;  and  there  are  a  good  many \\nmiles  to  go.’ \\n\\n‘  You  slept  late,  you  mean,’  said  Pippin.  ‘I  was  up  long \\nbefore;  and  we  are  only  waiting  for  you  to  finish  eating  and \\nthinking.’ \\n\\n‘I  have  finished  both  now.  And  I  am  going  to  make  for \\nBucklebury  Ferry  as  quickly  as  possible.  I  am  not  going  out \\nof  the  way,  back  to  the  road  we  left  last  night:  I  am  going  to \\ncut  straight  across  country  from  here.’ \\n\\n‘Then  you  are  going  to  fly,’  said  Pippin.  ‘You  won’t  cut \\nstraight  on  foot  anywhere  in  this  country.’ \\n\\n‘We  can  cut  straighter  than  the  road  anyway,’  answered \\nFrodo.  ‘The  Ferry  is  east  from  Woodhall;  but  the  hard  road \\ncurves  away  to  the  left  -  you  can  see  a  bend  of  it  away  north \\n\\n\\nA  SHORT  CUT  TO  MUSHROOMS  115 \\n\\nover  there.  It  goes  round  the  north  end  of  the  Marish  so  as \\nto  strike  the  causeway  from  the  Bridge  above  Stock.  But  that \\nis  miles  out  of  the  way.  We  could  save  a  quarter  of  the \\ndistance  if  we  made  a  line  for  the  Ferry  from  where  we  stand.’ \\n\\n‘ Short  cuts  make  long  delays ,’  argued  Pippin.  ‘The  country \\nis  rough  round  here,  and  there  are  bogs  and  all  lands  of \\ndifficulties  down  in  the  Marish  -  I  know  the  land  in  these \\nparts.  And  if  you  are  worrying  about  Black  Riders,  I  can’t \\nsee  that  it  is  any  worse  meeting  them  on  a  road  than  in  a \\nwood  or  a  field.’ \\n\\n‘It  is  less  easy  to  find  people  in  the  woods  and  fields,’ \\nanswered  Frodo.  ‘And  if  you  are  supposed  to  be  on  the  road, \\nthere  is  some  chance  that  you  will  be  looked  for  on  the  road \\nand  not  off  it.’ \\n\\n‘All  right!’  said  Pippin.  ‘I  will  follow  you  into  every  bog \\nand  ditch.  But  it  is  hard!  I  had  counted  on  passing  the  Golden \\nPerch  at  Stock  before  sundown.  The  best  beer  in  the  East¬ \\nfarthing,  or  used  to  be:  it  is  a  long  time  since  I  tasted  it.’ \\n\\n‘That  settles  it!’  said  Frodo.  ‘Short  cuts  make  delays,  but \\ninns  make  longer  ones.  At  all  costs  we  must  keep  you  away \\nfrom  the  Golden  Perch.  We  want  to  get  to  Bucklebury  before \\ndark.  What  do  you  say,  Sam?’ \\n\\n‘I  will  go  along  with  you,  Mr.  Frodo,’  said  Sam  (in  spite \\nof  private  misgivings  and  a  deep  regret  for  the  best  beer  in \\nthe  Eastfarthing) . \\n\\n‘Then  if  we  are  going  to  toil  through  bog  and  briar,  let’s \\ngo  now!’  said  Pippin. \\n\\nIt  was  already  nearly  as  hot  as  it  had  been  the  day  before; \\nbut  clouds  were  beginning  to  come  up  from  the  West.  It \\nlooked  likely  to  turn  to  rain.  The  hobbits  scrambled  down  a \\nsteep  green  bank  and  plunged  into  the  thick  trees  below. \\nTheir  course  had  been  chosen  to  leave  Woodhall  to  their  left, \\nand  to  cut  slanting  through  the  woods  that  clustered  along \\nthe  eastern  side  of  the  hills,  until  they  reached  the  flats \\nbeyond.  Then  they  could  make  straight  for  the  Ferry  over \\ncountry  that  was  open,  except  for  a  few  ditches  and  fences. \\n\\n\\nIl6  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nFrodo  reckoned  they  had  eighteen  miles  to  go  in  a  straight  line. \\n\\nHe  soon  found  that  the  thicket  was  closer  and  more  tangled \\nthan  it  had  appeared.  There  were  no  paths  in  the  under¬ \\ngrowth,  and  they  did  not  get  on  very  fast.  When  they  had \\nstruggled  to  the  bottom  of  the  bank,  they  found  a  stream \\nrunning  down  from  the  hills  behind  in  a  deeply  dug  bed  with \\nsteep  slippery  sides  overhung  with  brambles.  Most  incon¬ \\nveniently  it  cut  across  the  line  they  had  chosen.  They  could \\nnot  jump  over  it,  nor  indeed  get  across  it  at  all  without  getting \\nwet,  scratched,  and  muddy.  They  halted,  wondering  what  to \\ndo.  ‘First  check!’  said  Pippin,  smiling  grimly. \\n\\nSam  Gamgee  looked  back.  Through  an  opening  in  the \\ntrees  he  caught  a  glimpse  of  the  top  of  the  green  bank  from \\nwhich  they  had  climbed  down. \\n\\n‘Look!’  he  said,  clutching  Frodo  by  the  arm.  They  all \\nlooked,  and  on  the  edge  high  above  them  they  saw  against \\nthe  sky  a  horse  standing.  Beside  it  stooped  a  black  figure. \\n\\nThey  at  once  gave  up  any  idea  of  going  back.  Frodo  led \\nthe  way,  and  plunged  quickly  into  the  thick  bushes  beside  the \\nstream.  ‘Whew!’  he  said  to  Pippin.  We  were  both  right!  The \\nshort  cut  has  gone  crooked  already;  but  we  got  under  cover \\nonly  just  in  time.  You’ve  got  sharp  ears,  Sam:  can  you  hear \\nanything  coming?’ \\n\\nThey  stood  still,  almost  holding  their  breath  as  they \\nlistened;  but  there  was  no  sound  of  pursuit.  ‘I  don’t  fancy \\nhe  would  try  bringing  his  horse  down  that  bank,’  said  Sam. \\n‘But  I  guess  he  knows  we  came  down  it.  We  had  better  be \\ngoing  on.’ \\n\\nGoing  on  was  not  altogether  easy.  They  had  packs  to  carry, \\nand  the  bushes  and  brambles  were  reluctant  to  let  them \\nthrough.  They  were  cut  off  from  the  wind  by  the  ridge \\nbehind,  and  the  air  was  still  and  stuffy.  When  they  forced \\ntheir  way  at  last  into  more  open  ground,  they  were  hot  and \\ntired  and  very  scratched,  and  they  were  also  no  longer  certain \\nof  the  direction  in  which  they  were  going.  The  banks  of  the \\nstream  sank,  as  it  reached  the  levels  and  became  broader  and \\nshallower,  wandering  off  towards  the  Marish  and  the  River. \\n\\n\\nA  SHORT  CUT  TO  MUSHROOMS  117 \\n\\n‘Why,  this  is  the  Stock-brook!’  said  Pippin.  ‘If  we  are  going \\nto  try  and  get  back  on  to  our  course,  we  must  cross  at  once \\nand  bear  right.’ \\n\\nThey  waded  the  stream,  and  hurried  over  a  wide  open \\nspace,  rush-grown  and  treeless,  on  the  further  side.  Beyond \\nthat  they  came  again  to  a  belt  of  trees:  tall  oaks,  for  the  most \\npart,  with  here  and  there  an  elm  tree  or  an  ash.  The  ground \\nwas  fairly  level,  and  there  was  little  undergrowth;  but  the \\ntrees  were  too  close  for  them  to  see  far  ahead.  The  leaves \\nblew  upwards  in  sudden  gusts  of  wind,  and  spots  of  rain \\nbegan  to  fall  from  the  overcast  sky.  Then  the  wind  died  away \\nand  the  rain  came  streaming  down.  They  trudged  along  as \\nfast  as  they  could,  over  patches  of  grass,  and  through  thick \\ndrifts  of  old  leaves;  and  all  about  them  the  rain  pattered  and \\ntrickled.  They  did  not  talk,  but  kept  glancing  back,  and  from \\nside  to  side. \\n\\nAfter  half  an  hour  Pippin  said:  ‘I  hope  we  have  not  turned \\ntoo  much  towards  the  south,  and  are  not  walking  longwise \\nthrough  this  wood!  It  is  not  a  very  broad  belt  -  I  should  have \\nsaid  no  more  than  a  mile  at  the  widest  -  and  we  ought  to \\nhave  been  through  it  by  now.’ \\n\\n‘It  is  no  good  our  starting  to  go  in  zig-zags,’  said  Frodo. \\n‘That  won’t  mend  matters.  Let  us  keep  on  as  we  are  going! \\nI  am  not  sure  that  I  want  to  come  out  into  the  open  yet.’ \\n\\nThey  went  on  for  perhaps  another  couple  of  miles.  Then \\nthe  sun  gleamed  out  of  ragged  clouds  again  and  the  rain \\nlessened.  It  was  now  past  mid-day,  and  they  felt  it  was  high \\ntime  for  lunch.  They  halted  under  an  elm  tree:  its  leaves \\nthough  fast  turning  yellow  were  still  thick,  and  the  ground  at \\nits  feet  was  fairly  dry  and  sheltered.  When  they  came  to  make \\ntheir  meal,  they  found  that  the  Elves  had  filled  their  bottles \\nwith  a  clear  drink,  pale  golden  in  colour:  it  had  the  scent  of \\na  honey  made  of  many  flowers,  and  was  wonderfully  refresh¬ \\ning.  Very  soon  they  were  laughing,  and  snapping  their  fingers \\nat  rain,  and  at  Black  Riders.  The  last  few  miles,  they  felt, \\nwould  soon  be  behind  them. \\n\\n\\nIl8  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nFrodo  propped  his  back  against  the  tree-trunk,  and  closed \\nhis  eyes.  Sam  and  Pippin  sat  near,  and  they  began  to  hum, \\nand  then  to  sing  softly: \\n\\nHo!  Ho!  Ho!  to  the  bottle  I  go \\nTo  heal  my  heart  and  drown  my  woe. \\n\\nRain  may  fall  and  wind  may  blow, \\n\\nAnd  many  miles  be  still  to  go, \\n\\nBut  under  a  tall  tree  I  will  lie, \\n\\nAnd  let  the  clouds  go  sailing  by. \\n\\nHo!  Ho!  Ho!  they  began  again  louder.  They  stopped  short \\nsuddenly.  Frodo  sprang  to  his  feet.  A  long-drawn  wail  came \\ndown  the  wind,  like  the  cry  of  some  evil  and  lonely  creature. \\nIt  rose  and  fell,  and  ended  on  a  high  piercing  note.  Even  as \\nthey  sat  and  stood,  as  if  suddenly  frozen,  it  was  answered  by \\nanother  cry,  fainter  and  further  off,  but  no  less  chilling  to  the \\nblood.  There  was  then  a  silence,  broken  only  by  the  sound \\nof  the  wind  in  the  leaves. \\n\\n‘And  what  do  you  think  that  was?’  Pippin  asked  at  last, \\ntrying  to  speak  lightly,  but  quavering  a  little.  ‘If  it  was  a  bird, \\nit  was  one  that  I  never  heard  in  the  Shire  before.’ \\n\\n‘It  was  not  bird  or  beast,’  said  Frodo.  ‘It  was  a  call,  or  a \\nsignal  -  there  were  words  in  that  cry,  though  I  could  not \\ncatch  them.  But  no  hobbit  has  such  a  voice.’ \\n\\nNo  more  was  said  about  it.  They  were  all  thinking  of  the \\nRiders,  but  no  one  spoke  of  them.  They  were  now  reluctant \\neither  to  stay  or  go  on;  but  sooner  or  later  they  had  got  to  get \\nacross  the  open  country  to  the  Ferry,  and  it  was  best  to  go \\nsooner  and  in  daylight.  In  a  few  moments  they  had  shoul¬ \\ndered  their  packs  again  and  were  off. \\n\\nBefore  long  the  wood  came  to  a  sudden  end.  Wide  grass¬ \\nlands  stretched  before  them.  They  now  saw  that  they  had,  in \\nfact,  turned  too  much  to  the  south.  Away  over  the  flats  they \\ncould  glimpse  the  low  hill  of  Bucklebury  across  the  River, \\nbut  it  was  now  to  their  left.  Creeping  cautiously  out  from  the \\n\\n\\nA  SHORT  CUT  TO  MUSHROOMS  119 \\n\\nedge  of  the  trees,  they  set  off  across  the  open  as  quickly  as \\nthey  could. \\n\\nAt  first  they  felt  afraid,  away  from  the  shelter  of  the  wood. \\nFar  back  behind  them  stood  the  high  place  where  they  had \\nbreakfasted.  Frodo  half  expected  to  see  the  small  distant \\nfigure  of  a  horseman  on  the  ridge  dark  against  the  sky;  but \\nthere  was  no  sign  of  one.  The  sun  escaping  from  the  breaking \\nclouds,  as  it  sank  towards  the  hills  they  had  left,  was  now \\nshining  brightly  again.  Their  fear  left  them,  though  they  still \\nfelt  uneasy.  But  the  land  became  steadily  more  tame  and \\nwell-ordered.  Soon  they  came  into  well-tended  fields  and \\nmeadows:  there  were  hedges  and  gates  and  dikes  for  drainage. \\nEverything  seemed  quiet  and  peaceful,  just  an  ordinary \\ncorner  of  the  Shire.  Their  spirits  rose  with  every  step.  The \\nline  of  the  River  grew  nearer;  and  the  Black  Riders  began  to \\nseem  like  phantoms  of  the  woods  now  left  far  behind. \\n\\nThey  passed  along  the  edge  of  a  huge  turnip-field,  and \\ncame  to  a  stout  gate.  Beyond  it  a  rutted  lane  ran  between  low \\nwell-laid  hedges  towards  a  distant  clump  of  trees.  Pippin \\nstopped. \\n\\n‘I  know  these  fields  and  this  gate!’  he  said.  ‘This  is  Bam- \\nfurlong,  old  Farmer  Maggot’s  land.  That’s  his  farm  away \\nthere  in  the  trees.’ \\n\\n‘One  trouble  after  another!’  said  Frodo,  looking  nearly  as \\nmuch  alarmed  as  if  Pippin  had  declared  the  lane  was  the \\nslot  leading  to  a  dragon’s  den.  The  others  looked  at  him  in \\nsurprise. \\n\\n‘What’s  wrong  with  old  Maggot?’  asked  Pippin.  ‘He’s  a \\ngood  friend  to  all  the  Brandybucks.  Of  course  he’s  a  terror \\nto  trespassers,  and  keeps  ferocious  dogs  -  but  after  all,  folk \\ndown  here  are  near  the  border  and  have  to  be  more  on  their \\nguard.’ \\n\\n‘I  know,’  said  Frodo.  ‘But  all  the  same,’  he  added  with  a \\nshamefaced  laugh,  ‘I  am  terrified  of  him  and  his  dogs.  I  have \\navoided  his  farm  for  years  and  years.  He  caught  me  several \\ntimes  trespassing  after  mushrooms,  when  I  was  a  youngster \\nat  Brandy  Hall.  On  the  last  occasion  he  beat  me,  and  then \\n\\n\\n120 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\ntook  me  and  showed  me  to  his  dogs.  “See,  lads,”  he  said, \\n“next  time  this  young  varmint  sets  foot  on  my  land,  you  can \\neat  him.  Now  see  him  off!”  They  chased  me  all  the  way  to \\nthe  Ferry.  I  have  never  got  over  the  fright  -  though  I  daresay \\nthe  beasts  knew  their  business  and  would  not  really  have \\ntouched  me.’ \\n\\nPippin  laughed.  ‘Well,  it’s  time  you  made  it  up.  Especially \\nif  you  are  coming  back  to  live  in  Buckland.  Old  Maggot  is \\nreally  a  stout  fellow  -  if  you  leave  his  mushrooms  alone.  Let’s \\nget  into  the  lane  and  then  we  shan’t  be  trespassing.  If  we \\nmeet  him,  I’ll  do  the  talking.  He  is  a  friend  of  Merry’s,  and  I \\nused  to  come  here  with  him  a  good  deal  at  one  time.’ \\n\\nThey  went  along  the  lane,  until  they  saw  the  thatched  roofs \\nof  a  large  house  and  farm-buildings  peeping  out  among  the \\ntrees  ahead.  The  Maggots,  and  the  Puddifoots  of  Stock,  and \\nmost  of  the  inhabitants  of  the  Marish,  were  house-dwellers; \\nand  this  farm  was  stoutly  built  of  brick  and  had  a  high  wall \\nall  round  it.  There  was  a  wide  wooden  gate  opening  out  of \\nthe  wall  into  the  lane. \\n\\nSuddenly  as  they  drew  nearer  a  terrific  baying  and  barking \\nbroke  out,  and  a  loud  voice  was  heard  shouting:  ‘Grip!  Fang! \\nWolf!  Come  on,  lads!’ \\n\\nFrodo  and  Sam  stopped  dead,  but  Pippin  walked  on  a  few \\npaces.  The  gate  opened  and  three  huge  dogs  came  pelting \\nout  into  the  lane,  and  dashed  towards  the  travellers,  barking \\nfiercely.  They  took  no  notice  of  Pippin;  but  Sam  shrank \\nagainst  the  wall,  while  two  wolvish-looking  dogs  sniffed  at \\nhim  suspiciously,  and  snarled  if  he  moved.  The  largest  and \\nmost  ferocious  of  the  three  halted  in  front  of  Frodo,  bristling \\nand  growling. \\n\\nThrough  the  gate  there  now  appeared  a  broad  thick-set \\nhobbit  with  a  round  red  face.  ‘Hallo!  Hallo!  And  who  may \\nyou  be,  and  what  may  you  be  wanting?’  he  asked. \\n\\n‘Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Maggot!’  said  Pippin. \\n\\nThe  farmer  looked  at  him  closely.  Well,  if  it  isn’t  Master \\nPippin  -  Mr.  Peregrin  Took,  I  should  say!’  he  cried,  changing \\n\\n\\nA  SHORT  CUT  TO  MUSHROOMS \\n\\n\\n121 \\n\\n\\nfrom  a  scowl  to  a  grin.  ‘It’s  a  long  time  since  I  saw  you  round \\nhere.  It’s  lucky  for  you  that  I  know  you.  I  was  just  going  out \\nto  set  my  dogs  on  any  strangers.  There  are  some  funny  things \\ngoing  on  today.  Of  course,  we  do  get  queer  folk  wandering \\nin  these  parts  at  times.  Too  near  the  River,’  he  said,  shaking \\nhis  head.  ‘But  this  fellow  was  the  most  outlandish  I  have  ever \\nset  eyes  on.  He  won’t  cross  my  land  without  leave  a  second \\ntime,  not  if  I  can  stop  it.’ \\n\\n‘What  fellow  do  you  mean?’  asked  Pippin. \\n\\n‘Then  you  haven’t  seen  him?’  said  the  farmer.  ‘He  went \\nup  the  lane  towards  the  causeway  not  a  long  while  back.  He \\nwas  a  funny  customer  and  asking  funny  questions.  But  per¬ \\nhaps  you’ll  come  along  inside,  and  we’ll  pass  the  news  more \\ncomfortable.  I’ve  a  drop  of  good  ale  on  tap,  if  you  and  your \\nfriends  are  willing,  Mr.  Took.’ \\n\\nIt  seemed  plain  that  the  farmer  would  tell  them  more,  if \\nallowed  to  do  it  in  his  own  time  and  fashion,  so  they  all \\naccepted  the  invitation.  ‘What  about  the  dogs?’  asked  Frodo \\nanxiously. \\n\\nThe  farmer  laughed.  ‘They  won’t  harm  you  -  not  unless  I \\ntell  ’em  to.  Here,  Grip!  Fang!  Heel!’  he  cried.  ‘Heel,  Wolf!’ \\nTo  the  relief  of  Frodo  and  Sam,  the  dogs  walked  away  and \\nlet  them  go  free. \\n\\nPippin  introduced  the  other  two  to  the  farmer.  ‘Mr.  Frodo \\nBaggins,’  he  said.  ‘You  may  not  remember  him,  but  he  used \\nto  live  at  Brandy  Hall.’  At  the  name  Baggins  the  farmer \\nstarted,  and  gave  Frodo  a  sharp  glance.  For  a  moment  Frodo \\nthought  that  the  memory  of  stolen  mushrooms  had  been \\naroused,  and  that  the  dogs  would  be  told  to  see  him  off.  But \\nFarmer  Maggot  took  him  by  the  arm. \\n\\nWell,  if  that  isn’t  queerer  than  ever!’  he  exclaimed.  ‘Mr. \\nBaggins  is  it?  Come  inside!  We  must  have  a  talk.’ \\n\\nThey  went  into  the  farmer’s  kitchen,  and  sat  by  the  wide \\nfire-place.  Mrs.  Maggot  brought  out  beer  in  a  huge  jug,  and \\nfilled  four  large  mugs.  It  was  a  good  brew,  and  Pippin  found \\nhimself  more  than  compensated  for  missing  the  Golden  Perch. \\nSam  sipped  his  beer  suspiciously.  He  had  a  natural  mistrust \\n\\n\\n122 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nof  the  inhabitants  of  other  parts  of  the  Shire;  and  also  he  was \\nnot  disposed  to  be  quick  friends  with  anyone  who  had  beaten \\nhis  master,  however  long  ago. \\n\\nAfter  a  few  remarks  about  the  weather  and  the  agricultural \\nprospects  (which  were  no  worse  than  usual),  Farmer  Maggot \\nput  down  his  mug  and  looked  at  them  all  in  turn. \\n\\n‘Now,  Mr.  Peregrin,’  he  said,  ‘where  might  you  be  coming \\nfrom,  and  where  might  you  be  going  to?  Were  you  coming \\nto  visit  me?  For,  if  so,  you  had  gone  past  my  gate  without \\nmy  seeing  you.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  no,’  answered  Pippin.  ‘To  tell  you  the  truth,  since \\nyou  have  guessed  it,  we  got  into  the  lane  from  the  other  end: \\nwe  had  come  over  your  fields.  But  that  was  quite  by  accident. \\nWe  lost  our  way  in  the  woods,  back  near  Woodhall,  trying  to \\ntake  a  short  cut  to  the  Ferry.’ \\n\\n‘If  you  were  in  a  hurry,  the  road  would  have  served  you \\nbetter,’  said  the  farmer.  ‘But  I  wasn’t  worrying  about  that. \\nYou  have  leave  to  walk  over  my  land,  if  you  have  a  mind, \\nMr.  Peregrin.  And  you,  Mr.  Baggins  -  though  I  daresay  you \\nstill  like  mushrooms.’  He  laughed.  ‘Ah  yes,  I  recognized  the \\nname.  I  recollect  the  time  when  young  Frodo  Baggins  was \\none  of  the  worst  young  rascals  of  Buckland.  But  it  wasn’t \\nmushrooms  I  was  thinking  of.  I  had  just  heard  the  name \\nBaggins  before  you  turned  up.  What  do  you  think  that  funny \\ncustomer  asked  me?’ \\n\\nThey  waited  anxiously  for  him  to  go  on.  ‘Well,’  the  farmer \\ncontinued,  approaching  his  point  with  slow  relish,  ‘he  came \\nriding  on  a  big  black  horse  in  at  the  gate,  which  happened  to \\nbe  open,  and  right  up  to  my  door.  All  black  he  was  himself, \\ntoo,  and  cloaked  and  hooded  up,  as  if  he  did  not  want  to  be \\nknown.  “Now  what  in  the  Shire  can  he  want?”  I  thought  to \\nmyself.  We  don’t  see  many  of  the  Big  Folic  over  the  border; \\nand  anyway  I  had  never  heard  of  any  like  this  black  fellow. \\n\\n‘  “Good-day  to  you!”  I  says,  going  out  to  him.  “This  lane \\ndon’t  lead  anywhere,  and  wherever  you  may  be  going,  your \\nquickest  way  will  be  back  to  the  road.”  I  didn’t  like  the  looks \\nof  him;  and  when  Grip  came  out,  he  took  one  sniff  and  let \\n\\n\\nA  SHORT  CUT  TO  MUSHROOMS  123 \\n\\nout  a  yelp  as  if  he  had  been  stung:  he  put  down  his  tail  and \\nbolted  off  howling.  The  black  fellow  sat  quite  still. \\n\\n‘  “I  come  from  yonder,”  he  said,  slow  and  stiff-like, \\npointing  back  west,  over  my  fields,  if  you  please.  “Have  you \\nseen  Baggins ?”  he  asked  in  a  queer  voice,  and  bent  down \\ntowards  me.  I  could  not  see  any  face,  for  his  hood  fell  down \\nso  low;  and  I  felt  a  sort  of  shiver  down  my  back.  But  I  did \\nnot  see  why  he  should  come  riding  over  my  land  so  bold. \\n\\n‘  “Be  off!”  I  said.  “There  are  no  Bagginses  here.  You’re  in \\nthe  wrong  part  of  the  Shire.  You  had  better  go  back  west  to \\nHobbiton  -  but  you  can  go  by  road  this  time.” \\n\\n‘  “Baggins  has  left,”  he  answered  in  a  whisper.  “He  is \\ncoming.  He  is  not  far  away.  I  wish  to  find  him.  If  he  passes \\nwill  you  tell  me?  I  will  come  back  with  gold.” \\n\\n‘“No  you  won’t,”  I  said.  “You’ll  go  back  where  you \\nbelong,  double  quick.  I  give  you  one  minute  before  I  call  all \\nmy  dogs.” \\n\\n‘He  gave  a  sort  of  hiss.  It  might  have  been  laughing,  and \\nit  might  not.  Then  he  spurred  his  great  horse  right  at  me, \\nand  I  jumped  out  of  the  way  only  just  in  time.  I  called  the \\ndogs,  but  he  swung  off,  and  rode  through  the  gate  and  up \\nthe  lane  towards  the  causeway  like  a  bolt  of  thunder.  What \\ndo  you  think  of  that?’ \\n\\nFrodo  sat  for  a  moment  looking  at  the  fire,  but  his  only \\nthought  was  how  on  earth  would  they  reach  the  Ferry.  ‘I \\ndon’t  know  what  to  think,’  he  said  at  last. \\n\\n‘Then  I’ll  tell  you  what  to  think,’  said  Maggot.  ‘You  should \\nnever  have  gone  mixing  yourself  up  with  Hobbiton  folk,  Mr. \\nFrodo.  Folk  are  queer  up  there.’  Sam  stirred  in  his  chair,  and \\nlooked  at  the  farmer  with  an  unfriendly  eye.  ‘But  you  were \\nalways  a  reckless  lad.  When  I  heard  you  had  left  the  Brandy- \\nbucks  and  gone  off  to  that  old  Mr.  Bilbo,  I  said  that  you  were \\ngoing  to  find  trouble.  Mark  my  words,  this  all  comes  of  those \\nstrange  doings  of  Mr.  Bilbo’s.  His  money  was  got  in  some \\nstrange  fashion  in  foreign  parts,  they  say.  Maybe  there  is \\nsome  that  want  to  know  what  has  become  of  the  gold  and \\njewels  that  he  buried  in  the  hill  of  Hobbiton,  as  I  hear?’ \\n\\n\\n124 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nFrodo  said  nothing:  the  shrewd  guesses  of  the  farmer  were \\nrather  disconcerting. \\n\\n‘Well,  Mr.  Frodo,’  Maggot  went  on,  ‘I’m  glad  that  you’ve \\nhad  the  sense  to  come  back  to  Buckland.  My  advice  is:  stay \\nthere!  And  don’t  get  mixed  up  with  these  outlandish  folk. \\nYou’ll  have  friends  in  these  parts.  If  any  of  these  black  fellows \\ncome  after  you  again,  I’ll  deal  with  them.  I’ll  say  you’re  dead, \\nor  have  left  the  Shire,  or  anything  you  like.  And  that  might \\nbe  true  enough;  for  as  like  as  not  it  is  old  Mr.  Bilbo  they  want \\nnews  of.’ \\n\\n‘Maybe  you’re  right,’  said  Frodo,  avoiding  the  farmer’s  eye \\nand  staring  at  the  fire. \\n\\nMaggot  looked  at  him  thoughtfully.  ‘Well,  I  see  you  have \\nideas  of  your  own,’  he  said.  ‘It  is  as  plain  as  my  nose  that  no \\naccident  brought  you  and  that  rider  here  on  the  same  after¬ \\nnoon;  and  maybe  my  news  was  no  great  news  to  you,  after \\nall.  I  am  not  asking  you  to  tell  me  anything  you  have  a  mind \\nto  keep  to  yourself;  but  I  see  you  are  in  some  kind  of  trouble. \\nPerhaps  you  are  thinking  it  won’t  be  too  easy  to  get  to  the \\nFerry  without  being  caught?’ \\n\\n‘I  was  thinking  so,’  said  Frodo.  ‘But  we  have  got  to  try  and \\nget  there;  and  it  won’t  be  done  by  sitting  and  thinking.  So  I \\nam  afraid  we  must  be  going.  Thank  you  very  much  indeed \\nfor  your  kindness!  I’ve  been  in  terror  of  you  and  your  dogs \\nfor  over  thirty  years,  Farmer  Maggot,  though  you  may  laugh \\nto  hear  it.  It’s  a  pity:  for  I’ve  missed  a  good  friend.  And  now \\nI’m  sorry  to  leave  so  soon.  But  I’ll  come  back,  perhaps,  one \\nday  -  if  I  get  a  chance.’ \\n\\n‘You’ll  be  welcome  when  you  come,’  said  Maggot.  ‘But \\nnow  I’ve  a  notion.  It’s  near  sundown  already,  and  we  are \\ngoing  to  have  our  supper;  for  we  mostly  go  to  bed  soon  after \\nthe  Sun.  If  you  and  Mr.  Peregrin  and  all  could  stay  and  have \\na  bite  with  us,  we  would  be  pleased!’ \\n\\n‘And  so  should  we!’  said  Frodo.  ‘But  we  must  be  going  at \\nonce,  I’m  afraid.  Even  now  it  will  be  dark  before  we  can \\nreach  the  Ferry.’ \\n\\n‘Ah!  but  wait  a  minute!  I  was  going  to  say:  after  a  bit  of \\n\\n\\nA  SHORT  CUT  TO  MUSHROOMS \\n\\n\\n125 \\n\\n\\nsupper,  I’ll  get  out  a  small  waggon,  and  I’ll  drive  you  all  to \\nthe  Ferry.  That  will  save  you  a  good  step,  and  it  might  also \\nsave  you  trouble  of  another  sort.’ \\n\\nFrodo  now  accepted  the  invitation  gratefully,  to  the  relief \\nof  Pippin  and  Sam.  The  sun  was  already  behind  the  western \\nhills,  and  the  light  was  failing.  Two  of  Maggot’s  sons  and  his \\nthree  daughters  came  in,  and  a  generous  supper  was  laid  on \\nthe  large  table.  The  kitchen  was  lit  with  candles  and  the  fire \\nwas  mended.  Mrs.  Maggot  bustled  in  and  out.  One  or  two \\nother  hobbits  belonging  to  the  farm-household  came  in.  In  a \\nshort  while  fourteen  sat  down  to  eat.  There  was  beer  in \\nplenty,  and  a  mighty  dish  of  mushrooms  and  bacon,  besides \\nmuch  other  solid  farmhouse  fare.  The  dogs  lay  by  the  fire \\nand  gnawed  rinds  and  cracked  bones. \\n\\nWhen  they  had  finished,  the  farmer  and  his  sons  went  out \\nwith  a  lantern  and  got  the  waggon  ready.  It  was  dark  in  the \\nyard,  when  the  guests  came  out.  They  threw  their  packs  on \\nboard  and  climbed  in.  The  farmer  sat  in  the  driving-seat,  and \\nwhipped  up  his  two  stout  ponies.  His  wife  stood  in  the  light \\nof  the  open  door. \\n\\n‘You  be  careful  of  yourself,  Maggot!’  she  called.  ‘Don’t  go \\narguing  with  any  foreigners,  and  come  straight  back!’ \\n\\n‘I  will!’  said  he,  and  drove  out  of  the  gate.  There  was  now \\nno  breath  of  wind  stirring;  the  night  was  still  and  quiet,  and \\na  chill  was  in  the  air.  They  went  without  lights  and  took  it \\nslowly.  After  a  mile  or  two  the  lane  came  to  an  end,  crossing \\na  deep  dike,  and  climbing  a  short  slope  up  on  to  the  high- \\nbanked  causeway. \\n\\nMaggot  got  down  and  took  a  good  look  either  way,  north \\nand  south,  but  nothing  could  be  seen  in  the  darkness,  and \\nthere  was  not  a  sound  in  the  still  air.  Thin  strands  of  river-mist \\nwere  hanging  above  the  dikes,  and  crawling  over  the  fields. \\n\\n‘It’s  going  to  be  thick,’  said  Maggot;  ‘but  I’ll  not  light  my \\nlanterns  till  I  turn  for  home.  We’ll  hear  anything  on  the  road \\nlong  before  we  meet  it  tonight.’ \\n\\n\\n126 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nIt  was  five  miles  or  more  from  Maggot’s  lane  to  the  Ferry. \\nThe  hobbits  wrapped  themselves  up,  but  their  ears  were \\nstrained  for  any  sound  above  the  creak  of  the  wheels  and  the \\nslow  clop  of  the  ponies’  hoofs.  The  waggon  seemed  slower \\nthan  a  snail  to  Frodo.  Beside  him  Pippin  was  nodding \\ntowards  sleep;  but  Sam  was  staring  forwards  into  the  rising \\nfog. \\n\\nThey  reached  the  entrance  to  the  Ferry  lane  at  last.  It  was \\nmarked  by  two  tall  white  posts  that  suddenly  loomed  up  on \\ntheir  right.  Farmer  Maggot  drew  in  his  ponies  and  the  waggon \\ncreaked  to  a  halt.  They  were  just  beginning  to  scramble  out, \\nwhen  suddenly  they  heard  what  they  had  all  been  dreading: \\nhoofs  on  the  road  ahead.  The  sound  was  coming  towards \\nthem. \\n\\nMaggot  jumped  down  and  stood  holding  the  ponies’  heads, \\nand  peering  forward  into  the  gloom.  Clip-clop ,  clip-clop  came \\nthe  approaching  rider.  The  fall  of  the  hoofs  sounded  loud  in \\nthe  still,  foggy  air. \\n\\n‘You’d  better  be  hidden,  Mr.  Frodo,’  said  Sam  anxiously. \\n‘You  get  down  in  the  waggon  and  cover  up  with  blankets, \\nand  we’ll  send  this  rider  to  the  rightabouts!’  He  climbed  out \\nand  went  to  the  farmer’s  side.  Black  Riders  would  have  to \\nride  over  him  to  get  near  the  waggon. \\n\\nClop-clop,  clop-clop.  The  rider  was  nearly  on  them. \\n\\n‘Hallo  there!’  called  Farmer  Maggot.  The  advancing  hoofs \\nstopped  short.  They  thought  they  could  dimly  guess  a  dark \\ncloaked  shape  in  the  mist,  a  yard  or  two  ahead. \\n\\n‘Now  then!’  said  the  farmer,  throwing  the  reins  to  Sam  and \\nstriding  forward.  ‘Don’t  you  come  a  step  nearer!  What  do \\nyou  want,  and  where  are  you  going?’ \\n\\n‘I  want  Mr.  Baggins.  Have  you  seen  him?’  said  a  muffled \\nvoice  -  but  the  voice  was  the  voice  of  Merry  Brandybuck.  A \\ndark  lantern  was  uncovered,  and  its  light  fell  on  the  astonished \\nface  of  the  farmer. \\n\\n‘Mr.  Merry!’  he  cried. \\n\\n‘Yes,  of  course!  Who  did  you  think  it  was?’  said  Merry \\ncoming  forward.  As  he  came  out  of  the  mist  and  their  fears \\n\\n\\nA  SHORT  CUT  TO  MUSHROOMS \\n\\n\\n127 \\n\\n\\nsubsided,  he  seemed  suddenly  to  diminish  to  ordinary  hobbit- \\nsize.  He  was  riding  a  pony,  and  a  scarf  was  swathed  round \\nhis  neck  and  over  his  chin  to  keep  out  the  fog. \\n\\nFrodo  sprang  out  of  the  waggon  to  greet  him.  ‘So  there \\nyou  are  at  last!’  said  Merry.  ‘I  was  beginning  to  wonder  if \\nyou  would  turn  up  at  all  today,  and  I  was  just  going  back  to \\nsupper.  When  it  grew  foggy  I  came  across  and  rode  up \\ntowards  Stock  to  see  if  you  had  fallen  in  any  ditches.  But  I’m \\nblest  if  I  know  which  way  you  have  come.  Where  did  you \\nfind  them,  Mr.  Maggot?  In  your  duck-pond?’ \\n\\n‘No,  I  caught  ’em  trespassing,’  said  the  farmer,  ‘and  nearly \\nset  my  dogs  on  ’em;  but  they’ll  tell  you  all  the  story,  I’ve  no \\ndoubt.  Now,  if  you’ll  excuse  me,  Mr.  Merry  and  Mr.  Frodo \\nand  all,  I’d  best  be  turning  for  home.  Mrs.  Maggot  will  be \\nworriting  with  the  night  getting  thick.’ \\n\\nHe  backed  the  waggon  into  the  lane  and  turned  it.  ‘Well, \\ngood  night  to  you  all,’  he  said.  ‘It’s  been  a  queer  day,  and  no \\nmistake.  But  all’s  well  as  ends  well;  though  perhaps  we  should \\nnot  say  that  until  we  reach  our  own  doors.  I’ll  not  deny  that \\nI’ll  be  glad  now  when  I  do.’  He  lit  his  lanterns,  and  got  up. \\nSuddenly  he  produced  a  large  basket  from  under  the  seat.  ‘I \\nwas  nearly  forgetting,’  he  said.  ‘Mrs.  Maggot  put  this  up  for \\nMr.  Baggins,  with  her  compliments.’  He  handed  it  down  and \\nmoved  off,  followed  by  a  chorus  of  thanks  and  good-nights. \\n\\nThey  watched  the  pale  rings  of  light  round  his  lanterns  as \\nthey  dwindled  into  the  foggy  night.  Suddenly  Frodo  laughed: \\nfrom  the  covered  basket  he  held,  the  scent  of  mushrooms \\nwas  rising. \\n\\n\\nChapter  5 \\n\\n\\nA  CONSPIRACY  UNMASKED \\n\\n\\n‘Now  we  had  better  get  home  ourselves,’  said  Merry.  ‘There’s \\nsomething  funny  about  all  this,  I  see;  but  it  must  wait  till  we \\nget  in.’ \\n\\nThey  turned  down  the  Ferry  lane,  which  was  straight  and \\nwell-kept  and  edged  with  large  white-washed  stones.  In  a \\nhundred  yards  or  so  it  brought  them  to  the  river-bank,  where \\nthere  was  a  broad  wooden  landing-stage.  A  large  flat  ferry¬ \\nboat  was  moored  beside  it.  The  white  bollards  near  the \\nwater’s  edge  glimmered  in  the  light  of  two  lamps  on  high \\nposts.  Behind  them  the  mists  in  the  flat  fields  were  now  above \\nthe  hedges;  but  the  water  before  them  was  dark,  with  only  a \\nfew  curling  wisps  like  steam  among  the  reeds  by  the  hank. \\nThere  seemed  to  be  less  fog  on  the  further  side. \\n\\nMerry  led  the  pony  over  a  gangway  on  to  the  ferry,  and \\nthe  others  followed.  Merry  then  pushed  slowly  off  with  a  long \\npole.  The  Brandywine  flowed  slow  and  broad  before  them. \\nOn  the  other  side  the  bank  was  steep,  and  up  it  a  winding \\npath  climbed  from  the  further  landing.  Lamps  were  twinkling \\nthere.  Behind  loomed  up  the  Buck  Hill;  and  out  of  it,  through \\nstray  shrouds  of  mist,  shone  many  round  windows,  yellow \\nand  red.  They  were  the  windows  of  Brandy  Hall,  the  ancient \\nhome  of  the  Brandybucks. \\n\\nLong  ago  Gorhendad  Oldbuck,  head  of  the  Oldbuck \\nfamily,  one  of  the  oldest  in  the  Marish  or  indeed  in  the  Shire, \\nhad  crossed  the  river,  which  was  the  original  boundary  of \\nthe  land  eastwards.  He  built  (and  excavated)  Brandy  Hall, \\nchanged  his  name  to  Brandybuck,  and  settled  down  to \\nbecome  master  of  what  was  virtually  a  small  independent \\ncountry.  His  family  grew  and  grew,  and  after  his  days  con- \\n\\n\\nA  CONSPIRACY  UNMASKED \\n\\n\\n129 \\n\\n\\ntinued  to  grow,  until  Brandy  Hall  occupied  the  whole  of  the \\nlow  hill,  and  had  three  large  front-doors,  many  side-doors, \\nand  about  a  hundred  windows.  The  Brandybucks  and  their \\nnumerous  dependants  then  began  to  burrow,  and  later  to \\nbuild,  all  round  about.  That  was  the  origin  of  Buckland,  a \\nthickly  inhabited  strip  between  the  river  and  the  Old  Forest,  a \\nsort  of  colony  from  the  Shire.  Its  chief  village  was  Bucklebury, \\nclustering  in  the  banks  and  slopes  behind  Brandy  Hall. \\n\\nThe  people  in  the  Marish  were  friendly  with  the  Buck- \\nlanders,  and  the  authority  of  the  Master  of  the  Hall  (as  the \\nhead  of  the  Brandybuck  family  was  called)  was  still  acknowl¬ \\nedged  by  the  farmers  between  Stock  and  Rushey.  But  most \\nof  the  folk  of  the  old  Shire  regarded  the  Bucklanders  as \\npeculiar,  half  foreigners  as  it  were.  Though,  as  a  matter  of \\nfact,  they  were  not  very  different  from  the  other  hobbits \\nof  the  Four  Farthings.  Except  in  one  point:  they  were  fond \\nof  boats,  and  some  of  them  could  swim. \\n\\nTheir  land  was  originally  unprotected  from  the  East;  but \\non  that  side  they  had  built  a  hedge:  the  High  Hay.  It  had \\nbeen  planted  many  generations  ago,  and  was  now  thick  and \\ntall,  for  it  was  constantly  tended.  It  ran  all  the  way  from \\nBrandywine  Bridge,  in  a  big  loop  curving  away  from  the \\nriver,  to  Haysend  (where  the  Withywindle  flowed  out  of  the \\nForest  into  the  Brandywine) :  well  over  twenty  miles  from  end \\nto  end.  But,  of  course,  it  was  not  a  complete  protection. \\nThe  Forest  drew  close  to  the  hedge  in  many  places.  The \\nBucklanders  kept  their  doors  locked  after  dark,  and  that  also \\nwas  not  usual  in  the  Shire. \\n\\nThe  ferry-boat  moved  slowly  across  the  water.  The  Buck- \\nland  shore  drew  nearer.  Sam  was  the  only  member  of  the \\nparty  who  had  not  been  over  the  river  before.  He  had  a \\nstrange  feeling  as  the  slow  gurgling  stream  slipped  by:  his  old \\nlife  lay  behind  in  the  mists,  dark  adventure  lay  in  front.  He \\nscratched  his  head,  and  for  a  moment  had  a  passing  wish  that \\nMr.  Frodo  could  have  gone  on  living  quietly  at  Bag  End. \\n\\nThe  four  hobbits  stepped  off  the  ferry.  Merry  was  tying  it \\n\\n\\n130  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nup,  and  Pippin  was  already  leading  the  pony  up  the  path, \\nwhen  Sam  (who  had  been  looking  back,  as  if  to  take  farewell \\nof  the  Shire)  said  in  a  hoarse  whisper: \\n\\n‘Look  back,  Mr.  Frodo!  Do  you  see  anything?’ \\n\\nOn  the  far  stage,  under  the  distant  lamps,  they  could  just \\nmake  out  a  figure:  it  looked  like  a  dark  black  bundle  left \\nbehind.  But  as  they  looked  it  seemed  to  move  and  sway  this \\nway  and  that,  as  if  searching  the  ground.  It  then  crawled,  or \\nwent  crouching,  back  into  the  gloom  beyond  the  lamps. \\n\\n‘What  in  the  Shire  is  that?’  exclaimed  Merry. \\n\\n‘Something  that  is  following  us,’  said  Frodo.  ‘But  don’t  ask \\nany  more  now!  Let’s  get  away  at  once!’  They  hurried  up  the \\npath  to  the  top  of  the  bank,  but  when  they  looked  back  the \\nfar  shore  was  shrouded  in  mist,  and  nothing  could  be  seen. \\n\\n‘Thank  goodness  you  don’t  keep  any  boats  on  the  west- \\nbank!’  said  Frodo.  ‘Can  horses  cross  the  river?’ \\n\\n‘They  can  go  ten  miles  north  to  Brandywine  Bridge  -  or \\nthey  might  swim,’  answered  Merry.  ‘Though  I  never  heard \\nof  any  horse  swimming  the  Brandywine.  But  what  have \\nhorses  to  do  with  it?’ \\n\\n‘I’ll  tell  you  later.  Let’s  get  indoors  and  then  we  can  talk.’ \\n\\n‘All  right!  You  and  Pippin  know  your  way;  so  I’ll  just  ride \\non  and  tell  Fatty  Bolger  that  you  are  coming.  We’ll  see  about \\nsupper  and  things.’ \\n\\nWe  had  our  supper  early  with  Farmer  Maggot,’  said \\nFrodo;  ‘but  we  could  do  with  another.’ \\n\\n‘You  shall  have  it!  Give  me  that  basket!’  said  Merry,  and \\nrode  ahead  into  the  darkness. \\n\\nIt  was  some  distance  from  the  Brandywine  to  Frodo’s  new \\nhouse  at  Crickhollow.  They  passed  Buck  Hill  and  Brandy \\nHall  on  their  left,  and  on  the  outskirts  of  Bucklebury  struck \\nthe  main  road  of  Buckland  that  ran  south  from  the  Bridge. \\nHalf  a  mile  northward  along  this  they  came  to  a  lane  opening \\non  their  right.  This  they  followed  for  a  couple  of  miles  as  it \\nclimbed  up  and  down  into  the  country. \\n\\nAt  last  they  came  to  a  narrow  gate  in  a  thick  hedge.  Nothing \\n\\n\\nA  CONSPIRACY  UNMASKED  131 \\n\\ncould  be  seen  of  the  house  in  the  dark:  it  stood  back  from \\nthe  lane  in  the  middle  of  a  wide  circle  of  lawn  surrounded  by \\na  belt  of  low  trees  inside  the  outer  hedge.  Frodo  had  chosen \\nit,  because  it  stood  in  an  out-of-the-way  corner  of  the \\ncountry,  and  there  were  no  other  dwellings  close  by.  You \\ncould  get  in  and  out  without  being  noticed.  It  had  been  built \\na  long  while  before  by  the  Brandybucks,  for  the  use  of  guests, \\nor  members  of  the  family  that  wished  to  escape  from  the \\ncrowded  life  of  Brandy  Hall  for  a  time.  It  was  an  old- \\nfashioned  countrified  house,  as  much  like  a  hobbit-hole  as \\npossible:  it  was  long  and  low,  with  no  upper  storey;  and  it \\nhad  a  roof  of  turf,  round  windows,  and  a  large  round  door. \\n\\nAs  they  walked  up  the  green  path  from  the  gate  no  light \\nwas  visible;  the  windows  were  dark  and  shuttered.  Frodo \\nknocked  on  the  door,  and  Fatty  Bolger  opened  it.  A  friendly \\nlight  streamed  out.  They  slipped  in  quickly  and  shut  them¬ \\nselves  and  the  light  inside.  They  were  in  a  wide  hall  with \\ndoors  on  either  side;  in  front  of  them  a  passage  ran  back \\ndown  the  middle  of  the  house. \\n\\n‘Well,  what  do  you  think  of  it?’  asked  Merry  coming  up \\nthe  passage.  We  have  done  our  best  in  a  short  time  to  make \\nit  look  like  home.  After  all  Fatty  and  I  only  got  here  with  the \\nlast  cart-load  yesterday.’ \\n\\nFrodo  looked  round.  It  did  look  like  home.  Many  of  his \\nown  favourite  things  -  or  Bilbo’s  things  (they  reminded  him \\nsharply  of  him  in  their  new  setting)  -  were  arranged  as  nearly \\nas  possible  as  they  had  been  at  Bag  End.  It  was  a  pleasant, \\ncomfortable,  welcoming  place;  and  he  found  himself  wishing \\nthat  he  was  really  coming  here  to  settle  down  in  quiet  retire¬ \\nment.  It  seemed  unfair  to  have  put  his  friends  to  all  this \\ntrouble;  and  he  wondered  again  how  he  was  going  to  break \\nthe  news  to  them  that  he  must  leave  them  so  soon,  indeed  at \\nonce.  Yet  that  would  have  to  be  done  that  very  night,  before \\nthey  all  went  to  bed. \\n\\n‘It’s  delightful!’  he  said  with  an  effort.  ‘I  hardly  feel  that  I \\nhave  moved  at  all.’ \\n\\n\\n132 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nThe  travellers  hung  up  their  cloaks,  and  piled  their  packs  on \\nthe  floor.  Merry  led  them  down  the  passage  and  threw  open  a \\ndoor  at  the  far  end.  Firelight  came  out,  and  a  puff  of  steam. \\n\\n‘A  bath!’  cried  Pippin.  ‘O  blessed  Meriadoc!’ \\n\\n‘Which  order  shall  we  go  in?’  said  Frodo.  ‘Eldest  first,  or \\nquickest  first?  You’ll  be  last  either  way,  Master  Peregrin.’ \\n\\n‘Trust  me  to  arrange  things  better  than  that!’  said  Merry. \\n‘We  can’t  begin  life  at  Crickhollow  with  a  quarrel  over  baths. \\nIn  that  room  there  are  three  tubs,  and  a  copper  full  of  boiling \\nwater.  There  are  also  towels,  mats  and  soap.  Get  inside,  and \\nbe  quick!’ \\n\\nMerry  and  Fatty  went  into  the  kitchen  on  the  other  side  of \\nthe  passage,  and  busied  themselves  with  the  final  preparations \\nfor  a  late  supper.  Snatches  of  competing  songs  came  from \\nthe  bathroom  mixed  with  the  sound  of  splashing  and  wallow¬ \\ning.  The  voice  of  Pippin  was  suddenly  lifted  up  above  the \\nothers  in  one  of  Bilbo’s  favourite  bath-songs. \\n\\nSing  hey!  for  the  bath  at  close  of  day \\nthat  washes  the  weary  mud  away! \\n\\nA  loon  is  he  that  will  not  sing: \\n\\nO!  Water  Hot  is  a  noble  thing! \\n\\nO!  Sweet  is  the  sound  of  falling  rain, \\nand  the  brook  that  leaps  from  hill  to  plain; \\nbut  better  than  rain  or  rippling  streams \\nis  Water  Hot  that  smokes  and  steams. \\n\\nO!  Water  cold  we  may  pour  at  need \\ndown  a  thirsty  throat  and  be  glad  indeed; \\nbut  better  is  Beer,  if  drink  we  lack, \\nand  Water  Hot  poured  down  the  back. \\n\\nO!  Water  is  fair  that  leaps  on  high \\nin  a  fountain  white  beneath  the  sky; \\nbut  never  did  fountain  sound  so  sweet \\nas  splashing  Hot  Water  with  my  feet! \\n\\n\\nA  CONSPIRACY  UNMASKED \\n\\n\\n133 \\n\\n\\nThere  was  a  terrific  splash,  and  a  shout  of  Whoa!  from \\nFrodo.  It  appeared  that  a  lot  of  Pippin’s  bath  had  imitated  a \\nfountain  and  leaped  on  high. \\n\\nMerry  went  to  the  door:  ‘What  about  supper  and  beer  in \\nthe  throat?’  he  called.  Frodo  came  out  drying  his  hair. \\n\\n‘There’s  so  much  water  in  the  air  that  I’m  coming  into  the \\nkitchen  to  finish,’  he  said. \\n\\n‘Lawks!’  said  Merry,  looking  in.  The  stone  floor  was  swim¬ \\nming.  ‘You  ought  to  mop  all  that  up  before  you  get  anything \\nto  eat,  Peregrin,’  he  said.  ‘Hurry  up,  or  we  shan’t  wait  for  you.’ \\n\\nThey  had  supper  in  the  kitchen  on  a  table  near  the  fire. \\n‘I  suppose  you  three  won’t  want  mushrooms  again?’  said \\nFredegar  without  much  hope. \\n\\n‘Yes  we  shall!’  cried  Pippin. \\n\\n‘They’re  mine!’  said  Frodo.  ‘Given  to  me  by  Mrs.  Maggot, \\na  queen  among  farmers’  wives.  Take  your  greedy  hands \\naway,  and  I’ll  serve  them.’ \\n\\nHobbits  have  a  passion  for  mushrooms,  surpassing  even \\nthe  greediest  likings  of  Big  People.  A  fact  which  partly \\nexplains  young  Frodo’s  long  expeditions  to  the  renowned \\nfields  of  the  Marish,  and  the  wrath  of  the  injured  Maggot. \\nOn  this  occasion  there  was  plenty  for  all,  even  according  to \\nhobbit  standards.  There  were  also  many  other  things  to  fol¬ \\nlow,  and  when  they  had  finished  even  Fatty  Bolger  heaved  a \\nsigh  of  content.  They  pushed  back  the  table,  and  drew  chairs \\nround  the  fire. \\n\\n‘We’ll  clear  up  later,’  said  Merry.  ‘Now  tell  me  all  about  it! \\nI  guess  that  you  have  been  having  adventures,  which  was  not \\nquite  fair  without  me.  I  want  a  full  account;  and  most  of  all \\nI  want  to  know  what  was  the  matter  with  old  Maggot,  and \\nwhy  he  spoke  to  me  like  that.  He  sounded  almost  as  if  he  was \\nscared ,  if  that  is  possible.’ \\n\\nWe  have  all  been  scared,’  said  Pippin  after  a  pause,  in \\nwhich  Frodo  stared  at  the  fire  and  did  not  speak.  ‘You  would \\nhave  been,  too,  if  you  had  been  chased  for  two  days  by  Black \\nRiders.’ \\n\\n\\n134 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘And  what  are  they?’ \\n\\n‘Black  figures  riding  on  black  horses,’  answered  Pippin.  ‘If \\nFrodo  won’t  talk,  I  will  tell  you  the  whole  tale  from  the \\nbeginning.’  He  then  gave  a  full  account  of  their  journey  from \\nthe  time  when  they  left  Hobbiton.  Sam  gave  various  support¬ \\ning  nods  and  exclamations.  Frodo  remained  silent. \\n\\n‘I  should  think  you  were  malting  it  all  up,’  said  Merry,  ‘if \\nI  had  not  seen  that  black  shape  on  the  landing-stage  -  and \\nheard  the  queer  sound  in  Maggot’s  voice.  What  do  you  make \\nof  it  all,  Frodo?’ \\n\\n‘Cousin  Frodo  has  been  very  close,’  said  Pippin.  ‘But  the \\ntime  has  come  for  him  to  open  out.  So  far  we  have  been \\ngiven  nothing  more  to  go  on  than  Farmer  Maggot’s  guess \\nthat  it  has  something  to  do  with  old  Bilbo’s  treasure.’ \\n\\n‘That  was  only  a  guess,’  said  Frodo  hastily.  ‘Maggot  does \\nnot  know  anything.’ \\n\\n‘Old  Maggot  is  a  shrewd  fellow,’  said  Merry.  ‘A  lot  goes \\non  behind  his  round  face  that  does  not  come  out  in  his  talk. \\nI’ve  heard  that  he  used  to  go  into  the  Old  Forest  at  one  time, \\nand  he  has  the  reputation  of  knowing  a  good  many  strange \\nthings.  But  you  can  at  least  tell  us,  Frodo,  whether  you  think \\nhis  guess  good  or  bad.’ \\n\\n‘I  think,’’  answered  Frodo  slowly,  ‘that  it  was  a  good  guess, \\nas  far  as  it  goes.  There  is  a  connexion  with  Bilbo’s  old  adven¬ \\ntures,  and  the  Riders  are  looking,  or  perhaps  one  ought  to \\nsay  searching,  for  him  or  for  me.  I  also  fear,  if  you  want  to \\nknow,  that  it  is  no  joke  at  all;  and  that  I  am  not  safe  here  or \\nanywhere  else.’  He  looked  round  at  the  windows  and  walls, \\nas  if  he  was  afraid  they  would  suddenly  give  way.  The  others \\nlooked  at  him  in  silence,  and  exchanged  meaning  glances \\namong  themselves. \\n\\n‘It’s  coming  out  in  a  minute,’  whispered  Pippin  to  Merry. \\nMerry  nodded. \\n\\n‘Well!’  said  Frodo  at  last,  sitting  up  and  straightening  his \\nback,  as  if  he  had  made  a  decision.  ‘I  can’t  keep  it  dark  any \\nlonger.  I  have  got  something  to  tell  you  all.  But  I  don’t  know \\nquite  how  to  begin.’ \\n\\n\\nA  CONSPIRACY  UNMASKED  135 \\n\\n‘I  think  I  could  help  you,’  said  Merry  quietly,  ‘by  telling \\nyou  some  of  it  myself.’ \\n\\n‘What  do  you  mean?’  said  Frodo,  looking  at  him  anxiously. \\n\\n‘Just  this,  my  dear  old  Frodo:  you  are  miserable,  because \\nyou  don’t  know  how  to  say  good-bye.  You  meant  to  leave  the \\nShire,  of  course.  But  danger  has  come  on  you  sooner  than  you \\nexpected,  and  now  you  are  making  up  your  mind  to  go  at  once. \\nAnd  you  don’t  want  to.  We  are  very  sorry  for  you.’ \\n\\nFrodo  opened  his  mouth  and  shut  it  again.  His  look  of \\nsurprise  was  so  comical  that  they  laughed.  ‘Dear  old  Frodo!’ \\nsaid  Pippin.  ‘Did  you  really  think  you  had  thrown  dust  in  all \\nour  eyes?  You  have  not  been  nearly  careful  or  clever  enough \\nfor  that!  You  have  obviously  been  planning  to  go  and  saying \\nfarewell  to  all  your  haunts  all  this  year  since  April.  We  have \\nconstantly  heard  you  muttering:  “Shall  I  ever  look  down \\ninto  that  valley  again,  I  wonder”,  and  things  like  that.  And \\npretending  that  you  had  come  to  the  end  of  your  money,  and \\nactually  selling  your  beloved  Bag  End  to  those  Sackville- \\nBagginses!  And  all  those  close  talks  with  Gandalf.’ \\n\\n‘Good  heavens!’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  thought  I  had  been  both \\ncareful  and  clever.  I  don’t  know  what  Gandalf  would  say.  Is \\nall  the  Shire  discussing  my  departure  then?’ \\n\\n‘Oh  no!’  said  Merry.  ‘Don’t  worry  about  that!  The  secret \\nwon’t  keep  for  long,  of  course;  but  at  present  it  is,  I  think, \\nonly  known  to  us  conspirators.  After  all,  you  must  remember \\nthat  we  know  you  well,  and  are  often  with  you.  We  can \\nusually  guess  what  you  are  thinking.  I  knew  Bilbo,  too.  To \\ntell  you  the  truth,  I  have  been  watching  you  rather  closely \\never  since  he  left.  I  thought  you  would  go  after  him  sooner \\nor  later;  indeed  I  expected  you  to  go  sooner,  and  lately  we \\nhave  been  very  anxious.  We  have  been  terrified  that  you \\nmight  give  us  the  slip,  and  go  off  suddenly,  all  on  your  own \\nlike  he  did.  Ever  since  this  spring  we  have  kept  our  eyes  open, \\nand  done  a  good  deal  of  planning  on  our  own  account.  You \\nare  not  going  to  escape  so  easily!’ \\n\\n‘But  I  must  go,’  said  Frodo.  ‘It  cannot  be  helped,  dear \\nfriends.  It  is  wretched  for  us  all,  but  it  is  no  use  your  trying \\n\\n\\n136 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nto  keep  me.  Since  you  have  guessed  so  much,  please  help  me \\nand  do  not  hinder  me!’ \\n\\n‘You  do  not  understand!’  said  Pippin.  ‘You  must  go  -  and \\ntherefore  we  must,  too.  Merry  and  I  are  coming  with  you. \\nSam  is  an  excellent  fellow,  and  would  jump  down  a  dragon’s \\nthroat  to  save  you,  if  he  did  not  trip  over  his  own  feet;  but \\nyou  will  need  more  than  one  companion  in  your  dangerous \\nadventure.’ \\n\\n‘My  dear  and  most  beloved  hobbits!’  said  Frodo  deeply \\nmoved.  ‘But  I  could  not  allow  it.  I  decided  that  long  ago,  too. \\nYou  speak  of  danger,  but  you  do  not  understand.  This  is  no \\ntreasure -hunt,  no  there-and-back  journey.  I  am  flying  from \\ndeadly  peril  into  deadly  peril.’ \\n\\n‘Of  course  we  understand,’  said  Merry  firmly.  ‘That  is \\nwhy  we  have  decided  to  come.  We  know  the  Ring  is  no \\nlaughing-matter;  but  we  are  going  to  do  our  best  to  help  you \\nagainst  the  Enemy.’ \\n\\n‘The  Ring!’  said  Frodo,  now  completely  amazed. \\n\\n‘Yes,  the  Ring,’  said  Merry.  ‘My  dear  old  hobbit,  you  don’t \\nallow  for  the  inquisitiveness  of  friends.  I  have  known  about \\nthe  existence  of  the  Ring  for  years  -  before  Bilbo  went  away, \\nin  fact;  but  since  he  obviously  regarded  it  as  secret,  I  kept  the \\nknowledge  in  my  head,  until  we  formed  our  conspiracy.  I  did \\nnot  know  Bilbo,  of  course,  as  well  as  I  know  you;  I  was  too \\nyoung,  and  he  was  also  more  careful  -  but  he  was  not  care¬ \\nful  enough.  If  you  want  to  know  how  I  first  found  out,  I  will \\ntell  you.’ \\n\\n‘Go  on!’  said  Frodo  faintly. \\n\\n‘It  was  the  Sackville-Bagginses  that  were  his  downfall,  as  you \\nmight  expect.  One  day,  a  year  before  the  Party,  I  happened  to \\nbe  walking  along  the  road,  when  I  saw  Bilbo  ahead.  Suddenly \\nin  the  distance  the  S.-B.s  appeared,  coming  towards  us.  Bilbo \\nslowed  down,  and  then  hey  presto!  he  vanished.  I  was  so \\nstartled  that  I  hardly  had  the  wits  to  hide  myself  in  a  more \\nordinary  fashion;  but  I  got  through  the  hedge  and  walked \\nalong  the  field  inside.  I  was  peeping  through  into  the  road, \\nafter  the  S.-B.s  had  passed,  and  was  looking  straight  at  Bilbo \\n\\n\\nA  CONSPIRACY  UNMASKED  137 \\n\\nwhen  he  suddenly  reappeared.  I  caught  a  glint  of  gold  as  he \\nput  something  back  in  his  trouser-pocket. \\n\\n‘After  that  I  kept  my  eyes  open.  In  fact,  I  confess  that  I \\nspied.  But  you  must  admit  that  it  was  very  intriguing,  and \\nI  was  only  in  my  teens.  I  must  be  the  only  one  in  the  Shire, \\nbesides  you  Frodo,  that  has  ever  seen  the  old  fellow’s  secret \\nbook.’ \\n\\n‘You  have  read  his  book!’  cried  Frodo.  ‘Good  heavens \\nabove!  Is  nothing  safe?’ \\n\\n‘Not  too  safe,  I  should  say,’  said  Merry.  ‘But  I  have  only \\nhad  one  rapid  glance,  and  that  was  difficult  to  get.  He  never \\nleft  the  book  about.  I  wonder  what  became  of  it.  I  should  like \\nanother  look.  Have  you  got  it,  Frodo?’ \\n\\n‘No.  It  was  not  at  Bag  End.  He  must  have  taken  it  away.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  as  I  was  saying,’  Merry  proceeded,  ‘I  kept  my  know¬ \\nledge  to  myself,  till  this  spring  when  things  got  serious.  Then \\nwe  formed  our  conspiracy;  and  as  we  were  serious,  too,  and \\nmeant  business,  we  have  not  been  too  scrupulous.  You  are \\nnot  a  very  easy  nut  to  crack,  and  Gandalf  is  worse.  But  if  you \\nwant  to  be  introduced  to  our  chief  investigator,  I  can  produce \\nhim.’ \\n\\n‘Where  is  he?’  said  Frodo,  looking  round,  as  if  he  expected \\na  masked  and  sinister  figure  to  come  out  of  a  cupboard. \\n\\n‘Step  forward,  Sam!’  said  Merry;  and  Sam  stood  up  with \\na  face  scarlet  up  to  the  ears.  ‘Here’s  our  collector  of  infor¬ \\nmation!  And  he  collected  a  lot,  I  can  tell  you,  before  he  was \\nfinally  caught.  After  which,  I  may  say,  he  seemed  to  regard \\nhimself  as  on  parole,  and  dried  up.’ \\n\\n‘Sam!’  cried  Frodo,  feeling  that  amazement  could  go  no \\nfurther,  and  quite  unable  to  decide  whether  he  felt  angry, \\namused,  relieved,  or  merely  foolish. \\n\\n‘Yes,  sir!’  said  Sam.  ‘Begging  your  pardon,  sir!  But  I  meant \\nno  wrong  to  you,  Mr.  Frodo,  nor  to  Mr.  Gandalf  for  that \\nmatter.  He  has  some  sense,  mind  you;  and  when  you  said  go \\nalone ,  he  said  no!  take  someone  as  you  can  trust! \\n\\n‘But  it  does  not  seem  that  I  can  trust  anyone,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\nSam  looked  at  him  unhappily.  ‘It  all  depends  on  what  you \\n\\n\\n138 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nwant,’  put  in  Merry.  ‘You  can  trust  us  to  stick  to  you  through \\nthick  and  thin  -  to  the  bitter  end.  And  you  can  trust  us  to \\nkeep  any  secret  of  yours  -  closer  than  you  keep  it  yourself. \\nBut  you  cannot  trust  us  to  let  you  face  trouble  alone,  and  go \\noff  without  a  word.  We  are  your  friends,  Frodo.  Anyway: \\nthere  it  is.  We  know  most  of  what  Gandalf  has  told  you.  We \\nknow  a  good  deal  about  the  Ring.  We  are  horribly  afraid  - \\nbut  we  are  coming  with  you;  or  following  you  like  hounds.’ \\n\\n‘And  after  all,  sir,’  added  Sam,  ‘you  did  ought  to  take  the \\nElves’  advice.  Gildor  said  you  should  take  them  as  was  will¬ \\ning,  and  you  can’t  deny  it.’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  deny  it,’  said  Frodo,  looking  at  Sam,  who  was  now \\ngrinning.  ‘I  don’t  deny  it,  but  I’ll  never  believe  you  are  sleep¬ \\ning  again,  whether  you  snore  or  not.  I  shall  kick  you  hard  to \\nmake  sure. \\n\\n‘You  are  a  set  of  deceitful  scoundrels!’  he  said,  turning  to \\nthe  others.  ‘But  bless  you!’  he  laughed,  getting  up  and  waving \\nhis  arms,  ‘I  give  in.  I  will  take  Gildor’s  advice.  If  the  danger \\nwere  not  so  dark,  I  should  dance  for  joy.  Even  so,  I  cannot \\nhelp  feeling  happy;  happier  than  I  have  felt  for  a  long  time. \\nI  had  dreaded  this  evening.’ \\n\\n‘Good!  That’s  settled.  Three  cheers  for  Captain  Frodo  and \\ncompany!’  they  shouted;  and  they  danced  round  him.  Merry \\nand  Pippin  began  a  song,  which  they  had  apparently  got \\nready  for  the  occasion. \\n\\nIt  was  made  on  the  model  of  the  dwarf-song  that  started \\nBilbo  on  his  adventure  long  ago,  and  went  to  the  same  tune: \\n\\nFarewell  we  call  to  hearth  and  hall! \\n\\nThough  wind  may  blow  and  rain  may  fall, \\n\\nWe  must  away  ere  break  of  day \\nFar  over  wood  and  mountain  tall. \\n\\nTo  Rivendell,  where  Elves  yet  dwell \\nIn  glades  beneath  the  misty  fell, \\n\\nThrough  moor  and  waste  we  ride  in  haste, \\n\\nAnd  whither  then  we  cannot  tell. \\n\\n\\nA  CONSPIRACY  UNMASKED \\n\\n\\n139 \\n\\n\\nWith  foes  ahead,  behind  us  dread, \\n\\nBeneath  the  sky  shall  be  our  bed, \\n\\nUntil  at  last  our  toil  be  passed, \\n\\nOur  journey  done,  our  errand  sped. \\n\\nWe  must  away!  We  must  away! \\n\\nWe  ride  before  the  break  of  day! \\n\\n‘Very  good!’  said  Frodo.  ‘But  in  that  case  there  are  a  lot  of \\nthings  to  do  before  we  go  to  bed  -  under  a  roof,  for  tonight \\nat  any  rate.’ \\n\\n‘Oh!  That  was  poetry!’  said  Pippin.  ‘Do  you  really  mean \\nto  start  before  the  break  of  day?’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know,’  answered  Frodo.  ‘I  fear  those  Black  Riders, \\nand  I  am  sure  it  is  unsafe  to  stay  in  one  place  long,  especially \\nin  a  place  to  which  it  is  known  I  was  going.  Also  Gildor \\nadvised  me  not  to  wait.  But  I  should  very  much  like  to  see \\nGandalf.  I  could  see  that  even  Gildor  was  disturbed  when  he \\nheard  that  Gandalf  had  never  appeared.  It  really  depends  on \\ntwo  things.  How  soon  could  the  Riders  get  to  Bucldebury? \\nAnd  how  soon  could  we  get  off?  It  will  take  a  good  deal  of \\npreparation.’ \\n\\n‘The  answer  to  the  second  question,’  said  Merry,  ‘is  that \\nwe  could  get  off  in  an  hour.  I  have  prepared  practically  every¬ \\nthing.  There  are  five  ponies  in  a  stable  across  the  fields;  stores \\nand  tackle  are  all  packed,  except  for  a  few  extra  clothes,  and \\nthe  perishable  food.’ \\n\\n‘It  seems  to  have  been  a  very  efficient  conspiracy,’  said \\nFrodo.  ‘But  what  about  the  Black  Riders?  Would  it  be  safe \\nto  wait  one  day  for  Gandalf?’ \\n\\n‘That  all  depends  on  what  you  think  the  Riders  would  do, \\nif  they  found  you  here,’  answered  Merry.  ‘They  coidd  have \\nreached  here  by  now,  of  course,  if  they  were  not  stopped  at \\nthe  North-gate,  where  the  Hedge  runs  down  to  the  river- \\nbank,  just  this  side  of  the  Bridge.  The  gate-guards  would  not \\nlet  them  through  by  night,  though  they  might  break  through. \\nEven  in  the  daylight  they  would  try  to  keep  them  out,  I  think, \\n\\n\\n140  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nat  any  rate  until  they  got  a  message  through  to  the  Master  of \\nthe  Hall  -  for  they  would  not  like  the  look  of  the  Riders, \\nand  would  certainly  be  frightened  by  them.  But,  of  course, \\nBuckland  cannot  resist  a  determined  attack  for  long.  And  it \\nis  possible  that  in  the  morning  even  a  Black  Rider  that  rode \\nup  and  asked  for  Mr.  Baggins  would  be  let  through.  It  is \\npretty  generally  known  that  you  are  coming  back  to  live  at \\nCrickhollow.’ \\n\\nFrodo  sat  for  a  while  in  thought.  ‘I  have  made  up  my \\nmind,’  he  said  finally.  ‘I  am  starting  tomorrow,  as  soon  as  it \\nis  light.  But  I  am  not  going  by  road:  it  would  be  safer  to  wait \\nhere  than  that.  If  I  go  through  the  North-gate  my  departure \\nfrom  Buckland  will  be  known  at  once,  instead  of  being  secret \\nfor  several  days  at  least,  as  it  might  be.  And  what  is  more, \\nthe  Bridge  and  the  East  Road  near  the  borders  will  certainly \\nbe  watched,  whether  any  Rider  gets  into  Buckland  or  not. \\nWe  don’t  know  how  many  there  are;  but  there  are  at  least \\ntwo,  and  possibly  more.  The  only  thing  to  do  is  to  go  off  in \\na  quite  unexpected  direction.’ \\n\\n‘But  that  can  only  mean  going  into  the  Old  Forest!’  said \\nFredegar  horrified.  ‘You  can’t  be  thinking  of  doing  that.  It  is \\nquite  as  dangerous  as  Black  Riders.’ \\n\\n‘Not  quite,’  said  Merry.  ‘It  sounds  very  desperate,  but  I \\nbelieve  Frodo  is  right.  It  is  the  only  way  of  getting  off  without \\nbeing  followed  at  once.  With  luck  we  might  get  a  considerable \\nstart.’ \\n\\n‘But  you  won’t  have  any  luck  in  the  Old  Forest,’  objected \\nFredegar.  ‘No  one  ever  has  luck  in  there.  You’ll  get  lost. \\nPeople  don’t  go  in  there.’ \\n\\n‘Oh  yes  they  do!’  said  Merry.  ‘The  Brandybucks  go  in  - \\noccasionally  when  the  fit  takes  them.  We  have  a  private \\nentrance.  Frodo  went  in  once,  long  ago.  I  have  been  in  several \\ntimes:  usually  in  daylight,  of  course,  when  the  trees  are  sleepy \\nand  fairly  quiet.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  do  as  you  think  best!’  said  Fredegar.  ‘I  am  more \\nafraid  of  the  Old  Forest  than  of  anything  I  know  about:  the \\n\\n\\nA  CONSPIRACY  UNMASKED \\n\\n\\n141 \\n\\nstories  about  it  are  a  nightmare;  but  my  vote  hardly  counts, \\nas  I  am  not  going  on  the  journey.  Still,  I  am  very  glad  someone \\nis  stopping  behind,  who  can  tell  Gandalf  what  you  have  done, \\nwhen  he  turns  up,  as  I  am  sure  he  will  before  long.’ \\n\\nFond  as  he  was  of  Frodo,  Fatty  Bolger  had  no  desire  to \\nleave  the  Shire,  nor  to  see  what  lay  outside  it.  His  family \\ncame  from  the  Eastfarthing,  from  Budgeford  in  Bridgefields \\nin  fact,  but  he  had  never  been  over  the  Brandywine  Bridge. \\nHis  task,  according  to  the  original  plans  of  the  conspirators, \\nwas  to  stay  behind  and  deal  with  inquisitive  folk,  and  to  keep \\nup  as  long  as  possible  the  pretence  that  Mr.  Baggins  was  still \\nliving  at  Crickhollow.  He  had  even  brought  along  some  old \\nclothes  of  Frodo’s  to  help  him  in  playing  the  part.  They  little \\nthought  how  dangerous  that  part  might  prove. \\n\\n‘Excellent!’  said  Frodo,  when  he  understood  the  plan.  ‘We \\ncould  not  have  left  any  message  behind  for  Gandalf  other¬ \\nwise.  I  don’t  know  whether  these  Riders  can  read  or  not,  of \\ncourse,  but  I  should  not  have  dared  to  risk  a  written  message, \\nin  case  they  got  in  and  searched  the  house.  But  if  Fatty  is \\nwilling  to  hold  the  fort,  and  I  can  be  sure  of  Gandalf  knowing \\nthe  way  we  have  gone,  that  decides  me.  I  am  going  into  the \\nOld  Forest  first  thing  tomorrow.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  that’s  that,’  said  Pippin.  ‘On  the  whole  I  would  rather \\nhave  our  job  than  Fatty’s  -  waiting  here  till  Black  Riders \\ncome.’ \\n\\n‘You  wait  till  you  are  well  inside  the  Forest,’  said  Fredegar. \\n‘You’ll  wish  you  were  back  here  with  me  before  this  time \\ntomorrow.’ \\n\\n‘It’s  no  good  arguing  about  it  any  more,’  said  Merry.  ‘We \\nhave  still  got  to  tidy  up  and  put  the  finishing  touches  to  the \\npacking,  before  we  get  to  bed.  I  shall  call  you  all  before  the \\nbreak  of  day.’ \\n\\nWhen  at  last  he  had  got  to  bed,  Frodo  could  not  sleep  for \\nsome  time.  His  legs  ached.  He  was  glad  that  he  was  riding  in \\nthe  morning.  Eventually  he  fell  into  a  vague  dream,  in  which \\nhe  seemed  to  be  looking  out  of  a  high  window  over  a  dark \\n\\n\\n142 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nsea  of  tangled  trees.  Down  below  among  the  roots  there  was \\nthe  sound  of  creatures  crawling  and  snuffling.  He  felt  sure \\nthey  would  smell  him  out  sooner  or  later. \\n\\nThen  he  heard  a  noise  in  the  distance.  At  first  he  thought \\nit  was  a  great  wind  coming  over  the  leaves  of  the  forest.  Then \\nhe  knew  that  it  was  not  leaves,  but  the  sound  of  the  Sea \\nfar-off;  a  sound  he  had  never  heard  in  waking  life,  though  it \\nhad  often  troubled  his  dreams.  Suddenly  he  found  he  was \\nout  in  the  open.  There  were  no  trees  after  all.  He  was  on  a \\ndark  heath,  and  there  was  a  strange  salt  smell  in  the  air. \\nLooking  up  he  saw  before  him  a  tall  white  tower,  standing \\nalone  on  a  high  ridge.  A  great  desire  came  over  him  to  climb \\nthe  tower  and  see  the  Sea.  He  started  to  struggle  up  the  ridge \\ntowards  the  tower:  but  suddenly  a  light  came  in  the  sky,  and \\nthere  was  a  noise  of  thunder. \\n\\n\\nChapter  6 \\n\\n\\nTHE  OLD  FOREST \\n\\n\\nFrodo  woke  suddenly.  It  was  still  dark  in  the  room.  Merry \\nwas  standing  there  with  a  candle  in  one  hand,  and  banging \\non  the  door  with  the  other.  ‘All  right!  What  is  it?’  said  Frodo, \\nstill  shaken  and  bewildered. \\n\\nWhat  is  it!’  cried  Merry.  ‘It  is  time  to  get  up.  It  is  half  past \\nfour  and  very  foggy.  Come  on!  Sam  is  already  getting  breakfast \\nready.  Even  Pippin  is  up.  I  am  just  going  to  saddle  the  ponies, \\nand  fetch  the  one  that  is  to  be  the  baggage-carrier.  Wake  that \\nsluggard  Fatty!  At  least  he  must  get  up  and  see  us  off.’ \\n\\nSoon  after  six  o’clock  the  five  hobbits  were  ready  to  start. \\nFatty  Bolger  was  still  yawning.  They  stole  quietly  out  of  the \\nhouse.  Merry  went  in  front  leading  a  laden  pony,  and  took \\nhis  way  along  a  path  that  went  through  a  spinney  behind  the \\nhouse,  and  then  cut  across  several  fields.  The  leaves  of  trees \\nwere  glistening,  and  every  twig  was  dripping;  the  grass  was \\ngrey  with  cold  dew.  Everything  was  still,  and  far-away  noises \\nseemed  near  and  clear:  fowls  chattering  in  a  yard,  someone \\nclosing  a  door  of  a  distant  house. \\n\\nIn  their  shed  they  found  the  ponies:  sturdy  little  beasts  of \\nthe  kind  loved  by  hobbits,  not  speedy,  but  good  for  a  long \\nday’s  work.  They  mounted,  and  soon  they  were  riding  off \\ninto  the  mist,  which  seemed  to  open  reluctantly  before  them \\nand  close  forbiddingly  behind  them.  After  riding  for  about \\nan  hour,  slowly  and  without  talking,  they  saw  the  Hedge \\nlooming  suddenly  ahead.  It  was  tall  and  netted  over  with \\nsilver  cobwebs. \\n\\n‘How  are  you  going  to  get  through  this?’  asked  Fredegar. \\n\\n‘Follow  me!’  said  Merry,  ‘and  you  will  see.’  He  turned  to \\nthe  left  along  the  Hedge,  and  soon  they  came  to  a  point  where \\nit  bent  inwards,  running  along  the  lip  of  a  hollow.  A  cutting \\n\\n\\n144 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nhad  been  made,  at  some  distance  from  the  Hedge,  and  went \\nsloping  gently  down  into  the  ground.  It  had  walls  of  brick  at \\nthe  sides,  which  rose  steadily,  until  suddenly  they  arched  over \\nand  formed  a  tunnel  that  dived  deep  under  the  Hedge  and \\ncame  out  in  the  hollow  on  the  other  side. \\n\\nHere  Fatty  Bolger  halted.  ‘Good-bye,  Frodo!’  he  said.  ‘I \\nwish  you  were  not  going  into  the  Forest.  I  only  hope  you  will \\nnot  need  rescuing  before  the  day  is  out.  But  good  luck  to  you \\n-  today  and  every  day!’ \\n\\n‘If  there  are  no  worse  things  ahead  than  the  Old  Forest,  I \\nshall  be  lucky,’  said  Frodo.  ‘Tell  Gandalf  to  hurry  along  the \\nEast  Road:  we  shall  soon  be  back  on  it  and  going  as  fast  as \\nwe  can.’  ‘Good-bye!’  they  cried,  and  rode  down  the  slope \\nand  disappeared  from  Fredegar’s  sight  into  the  tunnel. \\n\\nIt  was  dark  and  damp.  At  the  far  end  it  was  closed  by  a \\ngate  of  thick-set  iron  bars.  Merry  got  down  and  unlocked  the \\ngate,  and  when  they  had  all  passed  through  he  pushed  it  to \\nagain.  It  shut  with  a  clang,  and  the  lock  clicked.  The  sound \\nwas  ominous. \\n\\n‘There!’  said  Merry.  ‘You  have  left  the  Shire,  and  are  now \\noutside,  and  on  the  edge  of  the  Old  Forest.’ \\n\\n‘Are  the  stories  about  it  true?’  asked  Pippin. \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know  what  stories  you  mean,’  Merry  answered.  ‘If \\nyou  mean  the  old  bogey-stories  Fatty’s  nurses  used  to  tell \\nhim,  about  goblins  and  wolves  and  things  of  that  sort,  I \\nshould  say  no.  At  any  rate  I  don’t  believe  them.  But  the \\nForest  is  queer.  Everything  in  it  is  very  much  more  alive, \\nmore  aware  of  what  is  going  on,  so  to  speak,  than  things  are \\nin  the  Shire.  And  the  trees  do  not  like  strangers.  They  watch \\nyou.  They  are  usually  content  merely  to  watch  you,  as  long \\nas  daylight  lasts,  and  don’t  do  much.  Occasionally  the  most \\nunfriendly  ones  may  drop  a  branch,  or  stick  a  root  out,  or \\ngrasp  at  you  with  a  long  trailer.  But  at  night  things  can  be \\nmost  alarming,  or  so  I  am  told.  I  have  only  once  or  twice \\nbeen  in  here  after  dark,  and  then  only  near  the  hedge.  I \\nthought  all  the  trees  were  whispering  to  each  other,  passing \\nnews  and  plots  along  in  an  unintelligible  language;  and  the \\n\\n\\nTHE  OLD  FOREST \\n\\n\\n145 \\n\\n\\nbranches  swayed  and  groped  without  any  wind.  They  do  say \\nthe  trees  do  actually  move,  and  can  surround  strangers  and \\nhem  them  in.  In  fact  long  ago  they  attacked  the  Hedge:  they \\ncame  and  planted  themselves  right  by  it,  and  leaned  over  it. \\nBut  the  hobbits  came  and  cut  down  hundreds  of  trees,  and \\nmade  a  great  bonfire  in  the  Forest,  and  burned  all  the  ground \\nin  a  long  strip  east  of  the  Hedge.  After  that  the  trees  gave  up \\nthe  attack,  but  they  became  very  unfriendly.  There  is  still  a \\nwide  bare  space  not  far  inside  where  the  bonfire  was  made.’ \\n\\n‘Is  it  only  the  trees  that  are  dangerous?’  asked  Pippin. \\n\\n‘There  are  various  queer  things  living  deep  in  the  Forest, \\nand  on  the  far  side,’  said  Merry,  ‘or  at  least  I  have  heard  so; \\nbut  I  have  never  seen  any  of  them.  But  something  makes \\npaths.  Whenever  one  comes  inside  one  finds  open  tracks;  but \\nthey  seem  to  shift  and  change  from  time  to  time  in  a  queer \\nfashion.  Not  far  from  this  tunnel  there  is,  or  was  for  a  long \\ntime,  the  beginning  of  quite  a  broad  path  leading  to  the \\nBonfire  Glade,  and  then  on  more  or  less  in  our  direction,  east \\nand  a  little  north.  That  is  the  path  I  am  going  to  try  and  find.’ \\n\\nThe  hobbits  now  left  the  tunnel-gate  and  rode  across  the \\nwide  hollow.  On  the  far  side  was  a  faint  path  leading  up  on \\nto  the  floor  of  the  Forest,  a  hundred  yards  and  more  beyond \\nthe  Hedge;  but  it  vanished  as  soon  as  it  brought  them  under \\nthe  trees.  Looking  back  they  could  see  the  dark  line  of  the \\nHedge  through  the  stems  of  trees  that  were  already  thick \\nabout  them.  Looking  ahead  they  could  see  only  tree-trunks \\nof  innumerable  sizes  and  shapes:  straight  or  bent,  twisted, \\nleaning,  squat  or  slender,  smooth  or  gnarled  and  branched; \\nand  all  the  stems  were  green  or  grey  with  moss  and  slimy, \\nshaggy  growths. \\n\\nMerry  alone  seemed  fairly  cheerful.  ‘You  had  better  lead \\non  and  find  that  path,’  Frodo  said  to  him.  ‘Don’t  let  us  lose \\none  another,  or  forget  which  way  the  Hedge  lies!’ \\n\\nThey  picked  a  way  among  the  trees,  and  their  ponies \\nplodded  along,  carefully  avoiding  the  many  writhing  and \\ninterlacing  roots.  There  was  no  undergrowth.  The  ground \\n\\n\\n146  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nwas  rising  steadily,  and  as  they  went  forward  it  seemed  that \\nthe  trees  became  taller,  darker,  and  thicker.  There  was  no \\nsound,  except  an  occasional  drip  of  moisture  falling  through \\nthe  still  leaves.  For  the  moment  there  was  no  whispering  or \\nmovement  among  the  branches;  but  they  all  got  an  uncom¬ \\nfortable  feeling  that  they  were  being  watched  with  dis¬ \\napproval,  deepening  to  dislike  and  even  enmity.  The  feeling \\nsteadily  grew,  until  they  found  themselves  looking  up  quickly, \\nor  glancing  back  over  their  shoulders,  as  if  they  expected  a \\nsudden  blow. \\n\\nThere  was  not  as  yet  any  sign  of  a  path,  and  the  trees \\nseemed  constantly  to  bar  their  way.  Pippin  suddenly  felt  that \\nhe  could  not  bear  it  any  longer,  and  without  warning  let  out \\na  shout.  ‘Oi!  Oi!’  he  cried.  ‘I  am  not  going  to  do  anything. \\nJust  let  me  pass  through,  will  you!’ \\n\\nThe  others  halted  startled;  but  the  cry  fell  as  if  muffled  by \\na  heavy  curtain.  There  was  no  echo  or  answer  though  the \\nwood  seemed  to  become  more  crowded  and  more  watchful \\nthan  before. \\n\\n‘I  should  not  shout,  if  I  were  you,’  said  Merry.  ‘It  does \\nmore  harm  than  good.’ \\n\\nFrodo  began  to  wonder  if  it  were  possible  to  find  a  way \\nthrough,  and  if  he  had  been  right  to  make  the  others  come \\ninto  this  abominable  wood.  Merry  was  looking  from  side  to \\nside,  and  seemed  already  uncertain  which  way  to  go.  Pippin \\nnoticed  it.  ‘It  has  not  taken  you  long  to  lose  us,’  he  said.  But  at \\nthat  moment  Merry  gave  a  whistle  of  relief  and  pointed  ahead. \\n\\n‘Well,  well!’  he  said.  ‘These  trees  do  shift.  There  is  the \\nBonfire  Glade  in  front  of  us  (or  I  hope  so),  but  the  path  to  it \\nseems  to  have  moved  away!’ \\n\\nThe  light  grew  clearer  as  they  went  forward.  Suddenly  they \\ncame  out  of  the  trees  and  found  themselves  in  a  wide  circular \\nspace.  There  was  sky  above  them,  blue  and  clear  to  their \\nsurprise,  for  down  under  the  Forest-roof  they  had  not  been \\nable  to  see  the  rising  morning  and  the  lifting  of  the  mist.  The \\nsun  was  not,  however,  high  enough  yet  to  shine  down  into \\n\\n\\nTHE  OLD  FOREST \\n\\n\\n147 \\n\\n\\nthe  clearing,  though  its  light  was  on  the  tree-tops.  The  leaves \\nwere  all  thicker  and  greener  about  the  edges  of  the  glade, \\nenclosing  it  with  an  almost  solid  wall.  No  tree  grew  there, \\nonly  rough  grass  and  many  tall  plants:  stalky  and  faded  hem¬ \\nlocks  and  wood-parsley,  fire-weed  seeding  into  fluffy  ashes, \\nand  rampant  nettles  and  thistles.  A  dreary  place:  but  it \\nseemed  a  charming  and  cheerful  garden  after  the  close  Forest. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  felt  encouraged,  and  looked  up  hopefully  at \\nthe  broadening  daylight  in  the  sky.  At  the  far  side  of  the  glade \\nthere  was  a  break  in  the  wall  of  trees,  and  a  clear  path  beyond \\nit.  They  could  see  it  running  on  into  the  wood,  wide  in  places \\nand  open  above,  though  every  now  and  again  the  trees  drew \\nin  and  overshadowed  it  with  their  dark  boughs.  Up  this  path \\nthey  rode.  They  were  still  climbing  gently,  but  they  now  went \\nmuch  quicker,  and  with  better  heart;  for  it  seemed  to  them \\nthat  the  Forest  had  relented,  and  was  going  to  let  them  pass \\nunhindered  after  all. \\n\\nBut  after  a  while  the  air  began  to  get  hot  and  stuffy.  The \\ntrees  drew  close  again  on  either  side,  and  they  could  no  longer \\nsee  far  ahead.  Now  stronger  than  ever  they  felt  again  the \\nill  will  of  the  wood  pressing  on  them.  So  silent  was  it  that \\nthe  fall  of  their  ponies’  hoofs,  rustling  on  dead  leaves  and \\noccasionally  stumbling  on  hidden  roots,  seemed  to  thud  in \\ntheir  ears.  Frodo  tried  to  sing  a  song  to  encourage  them,  but \\nhis  voice  sank  to  a  murmur. \\n\\nO!  Wanderers  in  the  shadowed  land \\ndespair  not!  For  though  dark  they  stand, \\nall  woods  there  be  must  end  at  last, \\nand  see  the  open  sun  go  past: \\nthe  setting  sun,  the  rising  sun, \\nthe  day’s  end,  or  the  day  begun. \\n\\nFor  east  or  west  all  woods  must  fail .  .  . \\n\\nFail-  even  as  he  said  the  word  his  voice  faded  into  silence. \\nThe  air  seemed  heavy  and  the  making  of  words  wearisome. \\nJust  behind  them  a  large  branch  fell  from  an  old  overhanging \\n\\n\\n148  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\ntree  with  a  crash  into  the  path.  The  trees  seemed  to  close  in \\nbefore  them. \\n\\n‘They  do  not  like  all  that  about  ending  and  failing,’  said \\nMerry.  ‘I  should  not  sing  any  more  at  present.  Wait  till  we  do \\nget  to  the  edge,  and  then  we’ll  turn  and  give  them  a  rousing \\nchorus!’ \\n\\nHe  spoke  cheerfully,  and  if  he  felt  any  great  anxiety,  he  did \\nnot  show  it.  The  others  did  not  answer.  They  were  depressed. \\nA  heavy  weight  was  settling  steadily  on  Frodo’s  heart,  and \\nhe  regretted  now  with  every  step  forward  that  he  had  ever \\nthought  of  challenging  the  menace  of  the  trees.  He  was, \\nindeed,  just  about  to  stop  and  propose  going  back  (if  that \\nwas  still  possible),  when  things  took  a  new  turn.  The  path \\nstopped  climbing,  and  became  for  a  while  nearly  level.  The \\ndark  trees  drew  aside,  and  ahead  they  could  see  the  path  going \\nalmost  straight  forward.  Before  them,  but  some  distance  off, \\nthere  stood  a  green  hill-top,  treeless,  rising  like  a  bald  head \\nout  of  the  encircling  wood.  The  path  seemed  to  be  making \\ndirectly  for  it. \\n\\nThey  now  hurried  forward  again,  delighted  with  the \\nthought  of  climbing  out  for  a  while  above  the  roof  of  the \\nForest.  The  path  dipped,  and  then  again  began  to  climb \\nupwards,  leading  them  at  last  to  the  foot  of  the  steep  hillside. \\nThere  it  left  the  trees  and  faded  into  the  turf.  The  wood  stood \\nall  round  the  hill  like  thick  hair  that  ended  sharply  in  a  circle \\nround  a  shaven  crown. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  led  their  ponies  up,  winding  round  and  round \\nuntil  they  reached  the  top.  There  they  stood  and  gazed  about \\nthem.  The  air  was  gleaming  and  sunlit,  but  hazy;  and  they \\ncould  not  see  to  any  great  distance.  Near  at  hand  the  mist \\nwas  now  almost  gone;  though  here  and  there  it  lay  in  hollows \\nof  the  wood,  and  to  the  south  of  them,  out  of  a  deep  fold \\ncutting  right  across  the  Forest,  the  fog  still  rose  like  steam  or \\nwisps  of  white  smoke. \\n\\n‘That,’  said  Merry,  pointing  with  his  hand,  ‘that  is  the  line \\nof  the  Withywindle.  It  comes  down  out  of  the  Downs  and \\n\\n\\nTHE  OLD  FOREST \\n\\n\\n149 \\n\\n\\nflows  south-west  through  the  midst  of  the  Forest  to  join  the \\nBrandywine  below  Haysend.  We  don’t  want  to  go  that  way! \\nThe  Withywindle  valley  is  said  to  be  the  queerest  part  of  the \\nwhole  wood  -  the  centre  from  which  all  the  queerness  comes, \\nas  it  were.’ \\n\\nThe  others  looked  in  the  direction  that  Merry  pointed  out, \\nbut  they  could  see  little  but  mists  over  the  damp  and  deep-cut \\nvalley;  and  beyond  it  the  southern  half  of  the  Forest  faded \\nfrom  view. \\n\\nThe  sun  on  the  hill-top  was  now  getting  hot.  It  must  have \\nbeen  about  eleven  o’clock;  but  the  autumn  haze  still  pre¬ \\nvented  them  from  seeing  much  in  other  directions.  In  the \\nwest  they  could  not  make  out  either  the  line  of  the  Hedge  or \\nthe  valley  of  the  Brandywine  beyond  it.  Northward,  where \\nthey  looked  most  hopefully,  they  could  see  nothing  that  might \\nbe  the  line  of  the  great  East  Road,  for  which  they  were \\nmaking.  They  were  on  an  island  in  a  sea  of  trees,  and  the \\nhorizon  was  veiled. \\n\\nOn  the  south-eastern  side  the  ground  fell  very  steeply,  as \\nif  the  slopes  of  the  hill  were  continued  far  down  under  the \\ntrees,  like  island-shores  that  really  are  the  sides  of  a  mountain \\nrising  out  of  deep  waters.  They  sat  on  the  green  edge  and \\nlooked  out  over  the  woods  below  them,  while  they  ate  their \\nmid-day  meal.  As  the  sun  rose  and  passed  noon  they \\nglimpsed  far  off  in  the  east  the  grey-green  lines  of  the  Downs \\nthat  lay  beyond  the  Old  Forest  on  that  side.  That  cheered \\nthem  greatly;  for  it  was  good  to  see  a  sight  of  anything  beyond \\nthe  wood’s  borders,  though  they  did  not  mean  to  go  that  way, \\nif  they  could  help  it:  the  Barrow-downs  had  as  sinister  a \\nreputation  in  hobbit-legend  as  the  Forest  itself. \\n\\nAt  length  they  made  up  their  minds  to  go  on  again.  The  path \\nthat  had  brought  them  to  the  hill  reappeared  on  the  north¬ \\nward  side;  but  they  had  not  followed  it  far  before  they  became \\naware  that  it  was  bending  steadily  to  the  right.  Soon  it  began \\nto  descend  rapidly  and  they  guessed  that  it  must  actually \\nbe  heading  towards  the  Withywindle  valley:  not  at  all  the \\n\\n\\n150 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\ndirection  they  wished  to  take.  After  some  discussion  they \\ndecided  to  leave  this  misleading  path  and  strike  northward; \\nfor  although  they  had  not  been  able  to  see  it  from  the  hill-top, \\nthe  Road  must  lie  that  way,  and  it  could  not  be  many  miles \\noff.  Also  northward,  and  to  the  left  of  the  path,  the  land \\nseemed  to  be  drier  and  more  open,  climbing  up  to  slopes \\nwhere  the  trees  were  thinner,  and  pines  and  firs  replaced  the \\noaks  and  ashes  and  other  strange  and  nameless  trees  of  the \\ndenser  wood. \\n\\nAt  first  their  choice  seemed  to  be  good:  they  got  along  at \\na  fair  speed,  though  whenever  they  got  a  glimpse  of  the  sun \\nin  an  open  glade  they  seemed  unaccountably  to  have  veered \\neastwards.  But  after  a  time  the  trees  began  to  close  in  again, \\njust  where  they  had  appeared  from  a  distance  to  be  thinner \\nand  less  tangled.  Then  deep  folds  in  the  ground  were  dis¬ \\ncovered  unexpectedly,  like  the  ruts  of  great  giant-wheels  or \\nwide  moats  and  sunken  roads  long  disused  and  choked  with \\nbrambles.  These  lay  usually  right  across  their  line  of  march, \\nand  could  only  be  crossed  by  scrambling  down  and  out  again, \\nwhich  was  troublesome  and  difficult  with  their  ponies.  Each \\ntime  they  climbed  down  they  found  the  hollow  filled  with  thick \\nbushes  and  matted  undergrowth,  which  somehow  would  not \\nyield  to  the  left,  but  only  gave  way  when  they  turned  to  the \\nright;  and  they  had  to  go  some  distance  along  the  bottom \\nbefore  they  could  find  a  way  up  the  further  bank.  Each  time \\nthey  clambered  out,  the  trees  seemed  deeper  and  darker;  and \\nalways  to  the  left  and  upwards  it  was  most  difficult  to  find  a \\nway,  and  they  were  forced  to  the  right  and  downwards. \\n\\nAfter  an  hour  or  two  they  had  lost  all  clear  sense  of  direc¬ \\ntion,  though  they  knew  well  enough  that  they  had  long  ceased \\nto  go  northward  at  all.  They  were  being  headed  off,  and  were \\nsimply  following  a  course  chosen  for  them  -  eastwards  and \\nsouthwards,  into  the  heart  of  the  Forest  and  not  out  of  it. \\n\\nThe  afternoon  was  wearing  away  when  they  scrambled  and \\nstumbled  into  a  fold  that  was  wider  and  deeper  than  any  they \\nhad  yet  met.  It  was  so  steep  and  overhung  that  it  proved \\n\\n\\nTHE  OLD  FOREST \\n\\n\\n151 \\n\\nimpossible  to  climb  out  of  it  again,  either  forwards  or  back¬ \\nwards,  without  leaving  their  ponies  and  their  baggage  behind. \\nAll  they  could  do  was  to  follow  the  fold  -  downwards.  The \\nground  grew  soft,  and  in  places  boggy;  springs  appeared  in \\nthe  banks,  and  soon  they  found  themselves  following  a  brook \\nthat  trickled  and  babbled  through  a  weedy  bed.  Then  the \\nground  began  to  fall  rapidly,  and  the  brook  growing  strong \\nand  noisy,  flowed  and  leaped  swiftly  downhill.  They  were  in \\na  deep  dim-lit  gully  over-arched  by  trees  high  above  them. \\n\\nAfter  stumbling  along  for  some  way  along  the  stream,  they \\ncame  quite  suddenly  out  of  the  gloom.  As  if  through  a  gate \\nthey  saw  the  sunlight  before  them.  Coming  to  the  opening \\nthey  found  that  they  had  made  their  way  down  through  a \\ncleft  in  a  high  steep  bank,  almost  a  cliff.  At  its  feet  was  a \\nwide  space  of  grass  and  reeds;  and  in  the  distance  could  be \\nglimpsed  another  bank  almost  as  steep.  A  golden  afternoon \\nof  late  sunshine  lay  warm  and  drowsy  upon  the  hidden  land \\nbetween.  In  the  midst  of  it  there  wound  lazily  a  dark  river  of \\nbrown  water,  bordered  with  ancient  willows,  arched  over \\nwith  willows,  blocked  with  fallen  willows,  and  flecked  with \\nthousands  of  faded  willow-leaves.  The  air  was  thick  with \\nthem,  fluttering  yellow  from  the  branches;  for  there  was  a \\nwarm  and  gentle  breeze  blowing  softly  in  the  valley,  and  the \\nreeds  were  rustling,  and  the  willow-boughs  were  creaking. \\n\\n‘Well,  now  I  have  at  least  some  notion  of  where  we  are!’ \\nsaid  Merry.  We  have  come  almost  in  the  opposite  direction \\nto  which  we  intended.  This  is  the  River  Withywindle!  I  will \\ngo  on  and  explore.’ \\n\\nHe  passed  out  into  the  sunshine  and  disappeared  into  the \\nlong  grasses.  After  a  while  he  reappeared,  and  reported  that \\nthere  was  fairly  solid  ground  between  the  cliff-foot  and  the \\nriver;  in  some  places  firm  turf  went  down  to  the  water’s  edge. \\n‘What’s  more,’  he  said,  ‘there  seems  to  be  something  like  a \\nfootpath  winding  along  on  this  side  of  the  river.  If  we  turn \\nleft  and  follow  it,  we  shall  be  bound  to  come  out  on  the  east \\nside  of  the  Forest  eventually.’ \\n\\n‘I  dare  say!’  said  Pippin.  ‘That  is,  if  the  track  goes  on  so \\n\\n\\n152 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nfar,  and  does  not  simply  lead  us  into  a  bog  and  leave  us  there. \\nWho  made  the  track,  do  you  suppose,  and  why?  I  am  sure  it \\nwas  not  for  our  benefit.  I  am  getting  very  suspicious  of  this \\nForest  and  everything  in  it,  and  I  begin  to  believe  all  the \\nstories  about  it.  And  have  you  any  idea  how  far  eastward  we \\nshould  have  to  go?’ \\n\\n‘No,’  said  Merry,  ‘I  haven’t.  I  don’t  know  in  the  least  how \\nfar  down  the  Withywindle  we  are,  or  who  could  possibly \\ncome  here  often  enough  to  make  a  path  along  it.  But  there  is \\nno  other  way  out  that  I  can  see  or  think  of.’ \\n\\nThere  being  nothing  else  for  it,  they  filed  out,  and  Merry \\nled  them  to  the  path  that  he  had  discovered.  Everywhere  the \\nreeds  and  grasses  were  lush  and  tall,  in  places  far  above  their \\nheads;  but  once  found,  the  path  was  easy  to  follow,  as  it \\nturned  and  twisted,  picking  out  the  sounder  ground  among \\nthe  bogs  and  pools.  Here  and  there  it  passed  over  other  rills, \\nrunning  down  gullies  into  the  Withywindle  out  of  the  higher \\nforest-lands,  and  at  these  points  there  were  tree-trunks  or \\nbundles  of  brushwood  laid  carefully  across. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  began  to  feel  very  hot.  There  were  armies  of \\nflies  of  all  kinds  buzzing  round  their  ears,  and  the  afternoon \\nsun  was  burning  on  their  backs.  At  last  they  came  suddenly \\ninto  a  thin  shade;  great  grey  branches  reached  across  the \\npath.  Each  step  forward  became  more  reluctant  than  the  last. \\nSleepiness  seemed  to  be  creeping  out  of  the  ground  and  up \\ntheir  legs,  and  falling  softly  out  of  the  air  upon  their  heads \\nand  eyes. \\n\\nFrodo  felt  his  chin  go  down  and  his  head  nod.  Just  in  front \\nof  him  Pippin  fell  forward  on  to  his  knees.  Frodo  halted.  ‘It’s \\nno  good,’  he  heard  Merry  saying.  ‘Can’t  go  another  step  with¬ \\nout  rest.  Must  have  nap.  It’s  cool  under  the  willows.  Less  flies!’ \\n\\nFrodo  did  not  like  the  sound  of  this.  ‘Come  on!’  he  cried. \\nWe  can’t  have  a  nap  yet.  We  must  get  clear  of  the  Forest \\nfirst.’  But  the  others  were  too  far  gone  to  care.  Beside  them \\nSam  stood  yawning  and  blinking  stupidly. \\n\\nSuddenly  Frodo  himself  felt  sleep  overwhelming  him.  His \\n\\n\\nTHE  OLD  FOREST \\n\\n\\n153 \\n\\n\\nhead  swam.  There  now  seemed  hardly  a  sound  in  the  air. \\nThe  flies  had  stopped  buzzing.  Only  a  gentle  noise  on  the \\nedge  of  hearing,  a  soft  fluttering  as  of  a  song  half  whispered, \\nseemed  to  stir  in  the  boughs  above.  He  lifted  his  heavy  eyes \\nand  saw  leaning  over  him  a  huge  willow-tree,  old  and  hoary. \\nEnormous  it  looked,  its  sprawling  branches  going  up  like \\nreaching  arms  with  many  long-fingered  hands,  its  knotted \\nand  twisted  trunk  gaping  in  wide  fissures  that  creaked  faintly \\nas  the  boughs  moved.  The  leaves  fluttering  against  the  bright \\nsky  dazzled  him,  and  he  toppled  over,  lying  where  he  fell \\nupon  the  grass. \\n\\nMerry  and  Pippin  dragged  themselves  forward  and  lay \\ndown  with  their  backs  to  the  willow-trunk.  Behind  them  the \\ngreat  cracks  gaped  wide  to  receive  them  as  the  tree  swayed \\nand  creaked.  They  looked  up  at  the  grey  and  yellow  leaves, \\nmoving  softly  against  the  light,  and  singing.  They  shut  their \\neyes,  and  then  it  seemed  that  they  could  almost  hear  words, \\ncool  words,  saying  something  about  water  and  sleep.  They \\ngave  themselves  up  to  the  spell  and  fell  fast  asleep  at  the  foot \\nof  the  great  grey  willow. \\n\\nFrodo  lay  for  a  while  fighting  with  the  sleep  that  was  over¬ \\npowering  him;  then  with  an  effort  he  struggled  to  his  feet \\nagain.  He  felt  a  compelling  desire  for  cool  water.  ‘Wait  for \\nme,  Sam,’  he  stammered.  ‘Must  bathe  feet  a  minute.’ \\n\\nHalf  in  a  dream  he  wandered  forward  to  the  riverward  side \\nof  the  tree,  where  great  winding  roots  grew  out  into  the \\nstream,  like  gnarled  dragonets  straining  down  to  drink.  He \\nstraddled  one  of  these,  and  paddled  his  hot  feet  in  the  cool \\nbrown  water;  and  there  he  too  suddenly  fell  asleep  with  his \\nback  against  the  tree. \\n\\nSam  sat  down  and  scratched  his  head,  and  yawned  like  a \\ncavern.  He  was  worried.  The  afternoon  was  getting  late,  and \\nhe  thought  this  sudden  sleepiness  uncanny.  ‘There’s  more \\nbehind  this  than  sun  and  warm  air,’  he  muttered  to  himself. \\n‘I  don’t  like  this  great  big  tree.  I  don’t  trust  it.  Hark  at  it \\nsinging  about  sleep  now!  This  won’t  do  at  all!’ \\n\\n\\n154 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nHe  pulled  himself  to  his  feet,  and  staggered  off  to  see  what \\nhad  become  of  the  ponies.  He  found  that  two  had  wandered \\non  a  good  way  along  the  path;  and  he  had  just  caught  them \\nand  brought  them  back  towards  the  others,  when  he  heard \\ntwo  noises;  one  loud,  and  the  other  soft  but  very  clear.  One \\nwas  the  splash  of  something  heavy  falling  into  the  water;  the \\nother  was  a  noise  like  the  snick  of  a  lock  when  a  door  quietly \\ncloses  fast. \\n\\nHe  rushed  back  to  the  bank.  Frodo  was  in  the  water  close \\nto  the  edge,  and  a  great  tree-root  seemed  to  be  over  him  and \\nholding  him  down,  but  he  was  not  struggling.  Sam  gripped \\nhim  by  the  jacket,  and  dragged  him  from  under  the  root;  and \\nthen  with  difficulty  hauled  him  on  to  the  bank.  Almost  at \\nonce  he  woke,  and  coughed  and  spluttered. \\n\\n‘Do  you  know,  Sam,’  he  said  at  length,  ‘the  beastly  tree \\nthrew  me  in!  I  felt  it.  The  big  root  just  twisted  round  and \\ntipped  me  in!’ \\n\\n‘You  were  dreaming  I  expect,  Mr.  Frodo,’  said  Sam.  ‘You \\nshouldn’t  sit  in  such  a  place,  if  you  feel  sleepy.’ \\n\\n‘What  about  the  others?’  Frodo  asked.  ‘I  wonder  what  sort \\nof  dreams  they  are  having.’ \\n\\nThey  went  round  to  the  other  side  of  the  tree,  and  then \\nSam  understood  the  click  that  he  had  heard.  Pippin  had \\nvanished.  The  crack  by  which  he  had  laid  himself  had  closed \\ntogether,  so  that  not  a  chink  could  be  seen.  Merry  was \\ntrapped:  another  crack  had  closed  about  his  waist;  his  legs \\nlay  outside,  but  the  rest  of  him  was  inside  a  dark  opening, \\nthe  edges  of  which  gripped  like  a  pair  of  pincers. \\n\\nFrodo  and  Sam  beat  first  upon  the  tree-trunk  where  Pippin \\nhad  lain.  They  then  struggled  frantically  to  pull  open  the  jaws \\nof  the  crack  that  held  poor  Merry.  It  was  quite  useless. \\n\\n‘What  a  foul  thing  to  happen!’  cried  Frodo  wildly.  ‘Why  did \\nwe  ever  come  into  this  dreadful  Forest?  I  wish  we  were  all  back \\nat  Crickhollow!’  He  kicked  the  tree  with  all  his  strength,  heed¬ \\nless  of  his  own  feet.  A  hardly  perceptible  shiver  ran  through \\nthe  stem  and  up  into  the  branches;  the  leaves  rustled  and \\nwhispered,  but  with  a  sound  now  of  faint  and  far-off  laughter. \\n\\n\\nTHE  OLD  FOREST  155 \\n\\n‘I  suppose  we  haven’t  got  an  axe  among  our  luggage,  Mr. \\nFrodo?’  asked  Sam. \\n\\n‘I  brought  a  little  hatchet  for  chopping  firewood,’  said \\nFrodo.  ‘That  wouldn’t  be  much  use.’ \\n\\n‘Wait  a  minute!’  cried  Sam,  struck  by  an  idea  suggested  by \\nfirewood.  ‘We  might  do  something  with  fire!’ \\n\\nWe  might,’  said  Frodo  doubtfully.  ‘We  might  succeed  in \\nroasting  Pippin  alive  inside.’ \\n\\nWe  might  try  to  hurt  or  frighten  this  tree  to  begin  with,’ \\nsaid  Sam  fiercely.  ‘If  it  don’t  let  them  go,  I’ll  have  it  down,  if \\nI  have  to  gnaw  it.’  He  ran  to  the  ponies  and  before  long  came \\nback  with  two  tinder-boxes  and  a  hatchet. \\n\\nQuickly  they  gathered  dry  grass  and  leaves,  and  bits  of \\nbark;  and  made  a  pile  of  broken  twigs  and  chopped  sticks. \\nThese  they  heaped  against  the  trunk  on  the  far  side  of  the \\ntree  from  the  prisoners.  As  soon  as  Sam  had  struck  a  spark \\ninto  the  tinder,  it  kindled  the  dry  grass  and  a  flurry  of  flame \\nand  smoke  went  up.  The  twigs  crackled.  Little  fingers  of  fire \\nlicked  against  the  dry  scored  rind  of  the  ancient  tree  and \\nscorched  it.  A  tremor  ran  through  the  whole  willow.  The \\nleaves  seemed  to  hiss  above  their  heads  with  a  sound  of  pain \\nand  anger.  A  loud  scream  came  from  Merry,  and  from  far \\ninside  the  tree  they  heard  Pippin  give  a  muffled  yell. \\n\\n‘Put  it  out!  Put  it  out!’  cried  Merry.  ‘He’ll  squeeze  me  in \\ntwo,  if  you  don’t.  He  says  so!’ \\n\\nWho?  What?’  shouted  Frodo,  rushing  round  to  the  other \\nside  of  the  tree. \\n\\n‘Put  it  out!  Put  it  out!’  begged  Merry.  The  branches  of  the \\nwillow  began  to  sway  violently.  There  was  a  sound  as  of  a \\nwind  rising  and  spreading  outwards  to  the  branches  of  all  the \\nother  trees  round  about,  as  though  they  had  dropped  a  stone \\ninto  the  quiet  slumber  of  the  river-valley  and  set  up  ripples \\nof  anger  that  ran  out  over  the  whole  Forest.  Sam  kicked  at \\nthe  little  fire  and  stamped  out  the  sparks.  But  Frodo,  without \\nany  clear  idea  of  why  he  did  so,  or  what  he  hoped  for,  ran \\nalong  the  path  crying  help!  help!  help!  It  seemed  to  him  that \\nhe  could  hardly  hear  the  sound  of  his  own  shrill  voice:  it  was \\n\\n\\n156 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nblown  away  from  him  by  the  willow-wind  and  drowned  in  a \\nclamour  of  leaves,  as  soon  as  the  words  left  his  mouth.  He \\nfelt  desperate:  lost  and  witless. \\n\\nSuddenly  he  stopped.  There  was  an  answer,  or  so  he \\nthought;  but  it  seemed  to  come  from  behind  him,  away  down \\nthe  path  further  back  in  the  Forest.  He  turned  round  and \\nlistened,  and  soon  there  could  be  no  doubt:  someone  was \\nsinging  a  song;  a  deep  glad  voice  was  singing  carelessly  and \\nhappily,  but  it  was  singing  nonsense: \\n\\nHey  dol!  merry  doll  ring  a  dong  dillo! \\n\\nRing  a  dong!  hop  along!  fal  lal  the  willow! \\n\\nTom  Bom,  jolly  Tom,  Tom  Bombadillo! \\n\\nHalf  hopeful  and  half  afraid  of  some  new  danger,  Frodo \\nand  Sam  now  both  stood  still.  Suddenly  out  of  a  long  string \\nof  nonsense-words  (or  so  they  seemed)  the  voice  rose  up \\nloud  and  clear  and  burst  into  this  song: \\n\\nHey!  Come  merry  dol!  derry  dol!  My  darling! \\n\\nLight  goes  the  weather-wind  and  the  feathered  starling. \\n\\nDown  along  under  Hill,  shining  in  the  sunlight, \\n\\nWaiting  on  the  doorstep  for  the  cold  starlight, \\n\\nThere  my  pretty  lady  is,  River-woman’s  daughter, \\n\\nSlender  as  the  willow-wand,  clearer  than  the  water. \\n\\nOld  Tom  Bombadil  water-lilies  bringing \\n\\nComes  hopping  home  again.  Can  you  hear  him  singing? \\n\\nHey!  Come  merry  dol!  derry  dol!  and  merry-o, \\n\\nGoldberry,  Goldberry,  merry  yellow  berry-o! \\n\\nPoor  old  Willow-man,  you  tuck  your  roots  away! \\n\\nTom’s  in  a  hurry  now.  Evening  will  follow  day. \\n\\nTom’s  going  home  again  water-lilies  bringing. \\n\\nHey!  Come  derry  dol!  Can  you  hear  me  singing? \\n\\nFrodo  and  Sam  stood  as  if  enchanted.  The  wind  puffed \\nout.  The  leaves  hung  silently  again  on  stiff  branches.  There \\nwas  another  burst  of  song,  and  then  suddenly,  hopping  and \\n\\n\\nTHE  OLD  FOREST \\n\\n\\n157 \\n\\n\\ndancing  along  the  path,  there  appeared  above  the  reeds  an \\nold  battered  hat  with  a  tall  crown  and  a  long  blue  feather \\nstuck  in  the  band.  With  another  hop  and  a  bound  there  came \\ninto  view  a  man,  or  so  it  seemed.  At  any  rate  he  was  too  large \\nand  heavy  for  a  hobbit,  if  not  quite  tall  enough  for  one  of  the \\nBig  People,  though  he  made  noise  enough  for  one,  stumping \\nalong  with  great  yellow  boots  on  his  thick  legs,  and  charging \\nthrough  grass  and  rushes  like  a  cow  going  down  to  drink.  He \\nhad  a  blue  coat  and  a  long  brown  beard;  his  eyes  were  blue \\nand  bright,  and  his  face  was  red  as  a  ripe  apple,  but  creased \\ninto  a  hundred  wrinkles  of  laughter.  In  his  hands  he  carried \\non  a  large  leaf  as  on  a  tray  a  small  pile  of  white  water-lilies. \\n\\n‘Help!’  cried  Frodo  and  Sam  running  towards  him  with \\ntheir  hands  stretched  out. \\n\\nWhoa!  Whoa!  steady  there!’  cried  the  old  man,  holding  up \\none  hand,  and  they  stopped  short,  as  if  they  had  been  struck \\nstiff.  ‘Now,  my  little  fellows,  where  be  you  a-going  to,  puffing \\nlike  a  bellows?  What’s  the  matter  here  then?  Do  you  know \\nwho  I  am?  I’m  Tom  Bombadil.  Tell  me  what’s  your  trouble! \\nTom’s  in  a  hurry  now.  Don’t  you  crush  my  lilies!’ \\n\\n‘My  friends  are  caught  in  the  willow-tree,’  cried  Frodo \\nbreathlessly. \\n\\n‘Master  Merry’s  being  squeezed  in  a  crack!’  cried  Sam. \\n\\n‘What?’  shouted  Tom  Bombadil,  leaping  up  in  the  air.  ‘Old \\nMan  Willow?  Naught  worse  than  that,  eh?  That  can  soon  be \\nmended.  I  know  the  tune  for  him.  Old  grey  Willow-man!  I’ll \\nfreeze  his  marrow  cold,  if  he  don’t  behave  himself.  I’ll  sing \\nhis  roots  off.  I’ll  sing  a  wind  up  and  blow  leaf  and  branch \\naway.  Old  Man  Willow!’ \\n\\nSetting  down  his  lilies  carefully  on  the  grass,  he  ran  to  the \\ntree.  There  he  saw  Merry’s  feet  still  sticking  out  -  the  rest \\nhad  already  been  drawn  further  inside.  Tom  put  his  mouth \\nto  the  crack  and  began  singing  into  it  in  a  low  voice.  They \\ncould  not  catch  the  words,  but  evidently  Merry  was  aroused. \\nHis  legs  began  to  luck.  Tom  sprang  away,  and  breaking  off \\na  hanging  branch  smote  the  side  of  the  willow  with  it.  ‘You \\nlet  them  out  again,  Old  Man  Willow!’  he  said.  ‘What  be  you \\n\\n\\ni58 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\na-thinking  of?  You  should  not  be  waking.  Eat  earth!  Dig \\ndeep!  Drink  water!  Go  to  sleep!  Bombadil  is  talking!’  He \\nthen  seized  Merry’s  feet  and  drew  him  out  of  the  suddenly \\nwidening  crack. \\n\\nThere  was  a  tearing  creak  and  the  other  crack  split  open, \\nand  out  of  it  Pippin  sprang,  as  if  he  had  been  lucked.  Then \\nwith  a  loud  snap  both  cracks  closed  fast  again.  A  shudder  ran \\nthrough  the  tree  from  root  to  tip,  and  complete  silence  fell. \\n\\n‘Thank  you!’  said  the  hobbits,  one  after  the  other. \\n\\nTom  Bombadil  burst  out  laughing.  ‘Well,  my  little  fellows!’ \\nsaid  he,  stooping  so  that  he  peered  into  their  faces.  ‘You  shall \\ncome  home  with  me!  The  table  is  all  laden  with  yellow  cream, \\nhoneycomb,  and  white  bread  and  butter.  Goldberry  is  wait¬ \\ning.  Time  enough  for  questions  around  the  supper  table.  You \\nfollow  after  me  as  quick  as  you  are  able!’  With  that  he  picked \\nup  his  lilies,  and  then  with  a  beckoning  wave  of  his  hand \\nwent  hopping  and  dancing  along  the  path  eastward,  still \\nsinging  loudly  and  nonsensically. \\n\\nToo  surprised  and  too  relieved  to  talk,  the  hobbits  followed \\nafter  him  as  fast  as  they  could.  But  that  was  not  fast  enough. \\nTom  soon  disappeared  in  front  of  them,  and  the  noise  of  his \\nsinging  got  fainter  and  further  away.  Suddenly  his  voice  came \\nfloating  back  to  them  in  a  loud  halloo! \\n\\nHop  along,  my  little  friends,  up  the  Withywindle! \\n\\nTom’s  going  on  ahead  candles  for  to  kindle. \\n\\nDown  west  sinks  the  Sun:  soon  you  will  be  groping. \\n\\nWhen  the  night-shadows  fall,  then  the  door  will  open, \\n\\nOut  of  the  window-panes  light  will  twinkle  yellow. \\n\\nFear  no  alder  black!  Heed  no  hoary  willow! \\n\\nFear  neither  root  nor  bough!  Tom  goes  on  before  you. \\n\\nHey  now!  merry  dol!  We’ll  be  waiting  for  you! \\n\\nAfter  that  the  hobbits  heard  no  more.  Almost  at  once  the \\nsun  seemed  to  sink  into  the  trees  behind  them.  They  thought \\nof  the  slanting  light  of  evening  glittering  on  the  Brandywine \\nRiver,  and  the  windows  of  Bucklebury  beginning  to  gleam \\n\\n\\nTHE  OLD  FOREST \\n\\n\\n159 \\n\\n\\nwith  hundreds  of  lights.  Great  shadows  fell  across  them; \\ntrunks  and  branches  of  trees  hung  dark  and  threatening  over \\nthe  path.  White  mists  began  to  rise  and  curl  on  the  surface \\nof  the  river  and  stray  about  the  roots  of  the  trees  upon  its \\nborders.  Out  of  the  very  ground  at  their  feet  a  shadowy  steam \\narose  and  mingled  with  the  swiftly  falling  dusk. \\n\\nIt  became  difficult  to  follow  the  path,  and  they  were  very \\ntired.  Their  legs  seemed  leaden.  Strange  furtive  noises  ran \\namong  the  bushes  and  reeds  on  either  side  of  them;  and  if \\nthey  looked  up  to  the  pale  sky,  they  caught  sight  of  queer \\ngnarled  and  knobbly  faces  that  gloomed  dark  against  the \\ntwilight,  and  leered  down  at  them  from  the  high  bank  and \\nthe  edges  of  the  wood.  They  began  to  feel  that  all  this  country \\nwas  unreal,  and  that  they  were  stumbling  through  an  ominous \\ndream  that  led  to  no  awakening. \\n\\nJust  as  they  felt  their  feet  slowing  down  to  a  standstill,  they \\nnoticed  that  the  ground  was  gently  rising.  The  water  began \\nto  murmur.  In  the  darkness  they  caught  the  white  glimmer \\nof  foam,  where  the  river  flowed  over  a  short  fall.  Then  sud¬ \\ndenly  the  trees  came  to  an  end  and  the  mists  were  left  behind. \\nThey  stepped  out  from  the  Forest,  and  found  a  wide  sweep \\nof  grass  welling  up  before  them.  The  river,  now  small  and \\nswift,  was  leaping  merrily  down  to  meet  them,  glinting  here \\nand  there  in  the  light  of  the  stars,  which  were  already  shining \\nin  the  sky. \\n\\nThe  grass  under  their  feet  was  smooth  and  short,  as  if  it \\nhad  been  mown  or  shaven.  The  eaves  of  the  Forest  behind \\nwere  clipped,  and  trim  as  a  hedge.  The  path  was  now  plain \\nbefore  them,  well- tended  and  bordered  with  stone.  It  wound \\nup  on  to  the  top  of  a  grassy  knoll,  now  grey  under  the  pale \\nstarry  night;  and  there,  still  high  above  them  on  a  further \\nslope,  they  saw  the  twinkling  lights  of  a  house.  Down  again \\nthe  path  went,  and  then  up  again,  up  a  long  smooth  hillside \\nof  turf,  towards  the  light.  Suddenly  a  wide  yellow  beam \\nflowed  out  brightly  from  a  door  that  was  opened.  There  was \\nTom  Bombadil’s  house  before  them,  up,  down,  under  hill. \\nBehind  it  a  steep  shoulder  of  the  land  lay  grey  and  bare,  and \\n\\n\\ni6o \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nbeyond  that  the  dark  shapes  of  the  Barrow-downs  stalked \\naway  into  the  eastern  night. \\n\\nThey  all  hurried  forward,  hobbits  and  ponies.  Already  half \\ntheir  weariness  and  all  their  fears  had  fallen  from  them.  Hey! \\nCome  merry  dol!  rolled  out  the  song  to  greet  them. \\n\\nHey!  Come  derry  dol!  Hop  along,  my  hearties! \\n\\nHobbits!  Ponies  all!  We  are  fond  of  parties. \\n\\nNow  let  the  fun  begin!  Let  us  sing  together! \\n\\nThen  another  clear  voice,  as  young  and  as  ancient  as \\nSpring,  like  the  song  of  a  glad  water  flowing  down  into  the \\nnight  from  a  bright  morning  in  the  hills,  came  falling  like \\nsilver  to  meet  them: \\n\\nNow  let  the  song  begin!  Let  us  sing  together \\n\\nOf  sun,  stars,  moon  and  mist,  rain  and  cloudy  weather, \\n\\nLight  on  the  budding  leaf,  dew  on  the  feather, \\n\\nWind  on  the  open  hill,  bells  on  the  heather, \\n\\nReeds  by  the  shady  pool,  lilies  on  the  water: \\n\\nOld  Tom  Bombadil  and  the  River-daughter! \\n\\nAnd  with  that  song  the  hobbits  stood  upon  the  threshold, \\nand  a  golden  light  was  all  about  them. \\n\\n\\nChapter  7 \\n\\n\\nIN  THE  HOUSE  OF  TOM  BOMBADIL \\n\\n\\nThe  four  hobbits  stepped  over  the  wide  stone  threshold,  and \\nstood  still,  blinking.  They  were  in  a  long  low  room,  filled  with \\nthe  light  of  lamps  swinging  from  the  beams  of  the  roof;  and \\non  the  table  of  dark  polished  wood  stood  many  candles,  tall \\nand  yellow,  burning  brightly. \\n\\nIn  a  chair,  at  the  far  side  of  the  room  facing  the  outer \\ndoor,  sat  a  woman.  Her  long  yellow  hair  rippled  down  her \\nshoulders;  her  gown  was  green,  green  as  young  reeds,  shot \\nwith  silver  like  beads  of  dew;  and  her  belt  was  of  gold,  shaped \\nlike  a  chain  of  flag-lilies  set  with  the  pale-blue  eyes  of  forget- \\nme-nots.  About  her  feet  in  wide  vessels  of  green  and  brown \\nearthenware,  white  water-lilies  were  floating,  so  that  she \\nseemed  to  be  enthroned  in  the  midst  of  a  pool. \\n\\n‘Enter,  good  guests!’  she  said,  and  as  she  spoke  they  knew \\nthat  it  was  her  clear  voice  they  had  heard  singing.  They  came \\na  few  timid  steps  further  into  the  room,  and  began  to  bow \\nlow,  feeling  strangely  surprised  and  awkward,  like  folk  that, \\nknocking  at  a  cottage  door  to  beg  for  a  drink  of  water,  have \\nbeen  answered  by  a  fair  young  elf-queen  clad  in  living \\nflowers.  But  before  they  could  say  anything,  she  sprang  lightly \\nup  and  over  the  lily-bowls,  and  ran  laughing  towards  them; \\nand  as  she  ran  her  gown  rustled  softly  like  the  wind  in  the \\nflowering  borders  of  a  river. \\n\\n‘Come  dear  folk!  ’  she  said,  taking  Frodo  by  the  hand .  ‘Laugh \\nand  be  merry!  I  am  Goldberry,  daughter  of  the  River.’  Then \\nlightly  she  passed  them  and  closing  the  door  she  turned  her \\nback  to  it,  with  her  white  arms  spread  out  across  it.  ‘Let  us  shut \\nout  the  night!’  she  said.  ‘For  you  are  still  afraid,  perhaps,  of  mist \\nand  tree-shadows  and  deep  water,  and  untame  things.  Fear \\nnothing!  For  tonight  you  are  under  the  roof  of  T om  Bombadil.  ’ \\n\\n\\ni62 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nThe  hobbits  looked  at  her  in  wonder;  and  she  looked  at \\neach  of  them  and  smiled.  ‘Fair  lady  Goldberry!’  said  Frodo \\nat  last,  feeling  his  heart  moved  with  a  joy  that  he  did  not \\nunderstand.  He  stood  as  he  had  at  times  stood  enchanted  by \\nfair  elven-voices;  but  the  spell  that  was  now  laid  upon  him \\nwas  different:  less  keen  and  lofty  was  the  delight,  but  deeper \\nand  nearer  to  mortal  heart;  marvellous  and  yet  not  strange. \\n‘Fair  lady  Goldberry!’  he  said  again.  ‘Now  the  joy  that  was \\nhidden  in  the  songs  we  heard  is  made  plain  to  me. \\n\\nO  slender  as  a  willow-wand!  O  clearer  than  clear  water! \\n\\nO  reed  by  the  living  pool!  Fair  River-daughter! \\n\\nO  spring-time  and  summer-time,  and  spring  again  after! \\n\\nO  wind  on  the  waterfall,  and  the  leaves’  laughter!’ \\n\\nSuddenly  he  stopped  and  stammered,  overcome  with  sur¬ \\nprise  to  hear  himself  saying  such  things.  But  Goldberry \\nlaughed. \\n\\n‘Welcome!’  she  said.  ‘I  had  not  heard  that  folk  of  the  Shire \\nwere  so  sweet-tongued.  But  I  see  that  you  are  an  Elf-friend; \\nthe  light  in  your  eyes  and  the  ring  in  your  voice  tells  it.  This \\nis  a  merry  meeting!  Sit  now,  and  wait  for  the  Master  of \\nthe  house!  He  will  not  be  long.  He  is  tending  your  Ured \\nbeasts.’ \\n\\nThe  hobbits  sat  down  gladly  in  low  rush-seated  chairs, \\nwhile  Goldberry  busied  herself  about  the  table;  and  their  eyes \\nfollowed  her,  for  the  slender  grace  of  her  movement  filled \\nthem  with  quiet  delight.  From  somewhere  behind  the  house \\ncame  the  sound  of  singing.  Every  now  and  again  they  caught, \\namong  many  a  derry  dol  and  a  merry  dol  and  a  ring  a  ding \\ndillo  the  repeated  words: \\n\\nOld  Tom  Bombadil  is  a  merry  fellow; \\n\\nBright  blue  his  jacket  is,  and  his  boots  are  yellow. \\n\\n‘Fair  lady!’  said  Frodo  again  after  a  while.  ‘Tell  me,  if  my \\nasking  does  not  seem  foolish,  who  is  Tom  Bombadil?’ \\n\\n\\nIN  THE  HOUSE  OF  TOM  BOMBADIL  163 \\n\\n‘He  is,’  said  Goldberry,  staying  her  swift  movements  and \\nsmiling. \\n\\nFrodo  looked  at  her  questioningly.  ‘He  is,  as  you  have  seen \\nhim,’  she  said  in  answer  to  his  look.  ‘He  is  the  Master  of \\nwood,  water,  and  hill.’ \\n\\n‘Then  all  this  strange  land  belongs  to  him?’ \\n\\n‘No  indeed!’  she  answered,  and  her  smile  faded.  ‘That \\nwould  indeed  be  a  burden,’  she  added  in  a  low  voice,  as  if  to \\nherself.  ‘The  trees  and  the  grasses  and  all  things  growing  or \\nliving  in  the  land  belong  each  to  themselves.  Tom  Bombadil \\nis  the  Master.  No  one  has  ever  caught  old  Tom  walking  in \\nthe  forest,  wading  in  the  water,  leaping  on  the  hill-tops  under \\nlight  and  shadow.  He  has  no  fear.  Tom  Bombadil  is  master.’ \\n\\nA  door  opened  and  in  came  Tom  Bombadil.  He  had  now \\nno  hat  and  his  thick  brown  hair  was  crowned  with  autumn \\nleaves.  He  laughed,  and  going  to  Goldberry,  took  her  hand. \\n\\n‘Here’s  my  pretty  lady!’  he  said,  bowing  to  the  hobbits. \\n‘Here’s  my  Goldberry  clothed  all  in  silver-green  with  flowers \\nin  her  girdle!  Is  the  table  laden?  I  see  yellow  cream  and \\nhoneycomb,  and  white  bread,  and  butter;  milk,  cheese,  and \\ngreen  herbs  and  ripe  berries  gathered.  Is  that  enough  for  us? \\nIs  the  supper  ready?’ \\n\\n‘It  is,’  said  Goldberry;  ‘but  the  guests  perhaps  are  not?’ \\n\\nTom  clapped  his  hands  and  cried:  ‘Tom,  Tom!  your  guests \\nare  tired,  and  you  had  near  forgotten!  Come  now,  my  merry \\nfriends,  and  Tom  will  refresh  you!  You  shall  clean  grimy \\nhands,  and  wash  your  weary  faces;  cast  off  your  muddy \\ncloaks  and  comb  out  your  tangles!’ \\n\\nHe  opened  the  door,  and  they  followed  him  down  a  short \\npassage  and  round  a  sharp  turn.  They  came  to  a  low  room \\nwith  a  sloping  roof  (a  penthouse,  it  seemed,  built  on  to  the \\nnorth  end  of  the  house).  Its  walls  were  of  clean  stone,  but \\nthey  were  mostly  covered  with  green  hanging  mats  and  yellow \\ncurtains.  The  floor  was  flagged,  and  strewn  with  fresh  green \\nrushes.  There  were  four  deep  mattresses,  each  piled  with \\nwhite  blankets,  laid  on  the  floor  along  one  side.  Against  the \\nopposite  wall  was  a  long  bench  laden  with  wide  earthenware \\n\\n\\n164  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nbasins,  and  beside  it  stood  brown  ewers  filled  with  water, \\nsome  cold,  some  steaming  hot.  There  were  soft  green  slippers \\nset  ready  beside  each  bed. \\n\\nBefore  long,  washed  and  refreshed,  the  hobbits  were  seated \\nat  the  table,  two  on  each  side,  while  at  either  end  sat  Gold- \\nberry  and  the  Master.  It  was  a  long  and  merry  meal.  Though \\nthe  hobbits  ate,  as  only  famished  hobbits  can  eat,  there  was \\nno  lack.  The  drink  in  their  drinking-bowls  seemed  to  be  clear \\ncold  water,  yet  it  went  to  their  hearts  like  wine  and  set  free \\ntheir  voices.  The  guests  became  suddenly  aware  that  they \\nwere  singing  merrily,  as  if  it  was  easier  and  more  natural  than \\ntalking. \\n\\nAt  last  Tom  and  Goldberry  rose  and  cleared  the  table \\nswiftly.  The  guests  were  commanded  to  sit  quiet,  and  were \\nset  in  chairs,  each  with  a  footstool  to  his  tired  feet.  There  was \\na  fire  in  the  wide  hearth  before  them,  and  it  was  burning \\nwith  a  sweet  smell,  as  if  it  were  built  of  apple-wood.  When \\neverything  was  set  in  order,  all  the  lights  in  the  room  were \\nput  out,  except  one  lamp  and  a  pair  of  candles  at  each  end \\nof  the  chimney-shelf.  Then  Goldberry  came  and  stood  before \\nthem,  holding  a  candle;  and  she  wished  them  each  a  good \\nnight  and  deep  sleep. \\n\\n‘Have  peace  now,’  she  said,  ‘until  the  morning!  Heed  no \\nnightly  noises!  For  nothing  passes  door  and  window  here \\nsave  moonlight  and  starlight  and  the  wind  off  the  hill-top. \\nGood  night!’  She  passed  out  of  the  room  with  a  glimmer  and \\na  rustle.  The  sound  of  her  footsteps  was  like  a  stream  falling \\ngently  away  downhill  over  cool  stones  in  the  quiet  of  night. \\n\\nTom  sat  on  a  while  beside  them  in  silence,  while  each  of \\nthem  tried  to  muster  the  courage  to  ask  one  of  the  many \\nquestions  he  had  meant  to  ask  at  supper.  Sleep  gathered  on \\ntheir  eyelids.  At  last  Frodo  spoke: \\n\\n‘Did  you  hear  me  calling,  Master,  or  was  it  just  chance  that \\nbrought  you  at  that  moment?’ \\n\\nTom  stirred  like  a  man  shaken  out  of  a  pleasant  dream. \\n‘Eh,  what?’  said  he.  ‘Did  I  hear  you  calling?  Nay,  I  did  not \\n\\n\\nIN  THE  HOUSE  OF  TOM  BOMBADIL  165 \\n\\nhear:  I  was  busy  singing.  Just  chance  brought  me  then,  if \\nchance  you  call  it.  It  was  no  plan  of  mine,  though  I  was \\nwaiting  for  you.  We  heard  news  of  you,  and  learned  that  you \\nwere  wandering.  We  guessed  you’d  come  ere  long  down  to \\nthe  water:  all  paths  lead  that  way,  down  to  Withywindle.  Old \\ngrey  Willow-man,  he’s  a  mighty  singer;  and  it’s  hard  for  little \\nfolic  to  escape  his  cunning  mazes.  But  Tom  had  an  errand \\nthere,  that  he  dared  not  hinder.’  Tom  nodded  as  if  sleep  was \\ntaking  him  again;  but  he  went  on  in  a  soft  singing  voice: \\n\\nI  had  an  errand  there:  gathering  water-lilies, \\ngreen  leaves  and  lilies  white  to  please  my  pretty  lady, \\nthe  last  ere  the  year’s  end  to  keep  them  from  the  winter, \\nto  flower  by  her  pretty  feet  till  the  snows  are  melted. \\n\\nEach  year  at  summer’s  end  I  go  to  find  them  for  her, \\nin  a  wide  pool,  deep  and  clear,  far  down  Withywindle; \\nthere  they  open  first  in  spring  and  there  they  linger  latest. \\n\\nBy  that  pool  long  ago  I  found  the  River-daughter, \\nfair  young  Goldberry  sitting  in  the  rushes. \\n\\nSweet  was  her  singing  then,  and  her  heart  was  beating! \\n\\nHe  opened  his  eyes  and  looked  at  them  with  a  sudden  glint \\nof  blue: \\n\\nAnd  that  proved  well  for  you  -  for  now  I  shall  no  longer \\ngo  down  deep  again  along  the  forest-water, \\nnot  while  the  year  is  old.  Nor  shall  I  be  passing \\nOld  Man  Willow’s  house  this  side  of  spring-time, \\nnot  till  the  merry  spring,  when  the  River-daughter \\ndances  down  the  withy-path  to  bathe  in  the  water. \\n\\nHe  fell  silent  again;  but  Frodo  could  not  help  asking  one \\nmore  question:  the  one  he  most  desired  to  have  answered. \\n‘Tell  us,  Master,’  he  said,  ‘about  the  Willow-man.  What  is \\nhe?  I  have  never  heard  of  him  before.’ \\n\\n‘No,  don’t!’  said  Merry  and  Pippin  together,  sitting  sud¬ \\ndenly  upright.  ‘Not  now!  Not  until  the  morning!’ \\n\\n\\ni66 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘That  is  right!’  said  the  old  man.  ‘Now  is  the  time  for \\nresting.  Some  things  are  ill  to  hear  when  the  world’s  in \\nshadow.  Sleep  till  the  morning-light,  rest  on  the  pillow!  Heed \\nno  nightly  noise!  Fear  no  grey  willow!’  And  with  that  he  took \\ndown  the  lamp  and  blew  it  out,  and  grasping  a  candle  in \\neither  hand  he  led  them  out  of  the  room. \\n\\nTheir  mattresses  and  pillows  were  soft  as  down,  and  the \\nblankets  were  of  white  wool.  They  had  hardly  laid  themselves \\non  the  deep  beds  and  drawn  the  light  covers  over  them  before \\nthey  were  asleep. \\n\\nIn  the  dead  night,  Frodo  lay  in  a  dream  without  light.  Then \\nhe  saw  the  young  moon  rising;  under  its  thin  light  there \\nloomed  before  him  a  black  wall  of  rock,  pierced  by  a  dark \\narch  like  a  great  gate.  It  seemed  to  Frodo  that  he  was  lifted \\nup,  and  passing  over  he  saw  that  the  rock-wall  was  a  circle \\nof  hills,  and  that  within  it  was  a  plain,  and  in  the  midst  of  the \\nplain  stood  a  pinnacle  of  stone,  like  a  vast  tower  but  not  made \\nby  hands.  On  its  top  stood  the  figure  of  a  man.  The  moon  as \\nit  rose  seemed  to  hang  for  a  moment  above  his  head  and \\nglistened  in  his  white  hair  as  the  wind  stirred  it.  Up  from  the \\ndark  plain  below  came  the  crying  of  fell  voices,  and  the  howl¬ \\ning  of  many  wolves.  Suddenly  a  shadow,  like  the  shape  of \\ngreat  wings,  passed  across  the  moon.  The  figure  lifted  his \\narms  and  a  light  flashed  from  the  staff  that  he  wielded.  A \\nmighty  eagle  swept  down  and  bore  him  away.  The  voices \\nwailed  and  the  wolves  yammered.  There  was  a  noise  like  a \\nstrong  wind  blowing,  and  on  it  was  borne  the  sound  of  hoofs, \\ngalloping,  galloping,  galloping  from  the  East.  ‘Black  Riders!’ \\nthought  Frodo  as  he  wakened,  with  the  sound  of  the  hoofs \\nstill  echoing  in  his  mind.  He  wondered  if  he  would  ever  again \\nhave  the  courage  to  leave  the  safety  of  these  stone  walls.  He \\nlay  motionless,  still  listening;  but  all  was  now  silent,  and  at \\nlast  he  turned  and  fell  asleep  again  or  wandered  into  some \\nother  unremembered  dream. \\n\\nAt  his  side  Pippin  lay  dreaming  pleasantly;  but  a  change \\ncame  over  his  dreams  and  he  turned  and  groaned.  Suddenly \\n\\n\\nIN  THE  HOUSE  OF  TOM  BOMBADIL  167 \\n\\nhe  woke,  or  thought  he  had  waked,  and  yet  still  heard  in  the \\ndarkness  the  sound  that  had  disturbed  his  dream:  tip-tap, \\nsqueak\\',  the  noise  was  like  branches  fretting  in  the  wind, \\ntwig-fingers  scraping  wall  and  window:  creak,  creak,  creak. \\nHe  wondered  if  there  were  willow-trees  close  to  the  house; \\nand  then  suddenly  he  had  a  dreadful  feeling  that  he  was  not \\nin  an  ordinary  house  at  all,  but  inside  the  willow  and  listening \\nto  that  horrible  dry  creaking  voice  laughing  at  him  again.  He \\nsat  up,  and  felt  the  soft  pillows  yield  to  his  hands,  and  he  lay \\ndown  again  relieved.  He  seemed  to  hear  the  echo  of  words \\nin  his  ears:  ‘Fear  nothing!  Have  peace  until  the  morning! \\nHeed  no  nightly  noises!’  Then  he  went  to  sleep  again. \\n\\nIt  was  the  sound  of  water  that  Merry  heard  falling  into  his \\nquiet  sleep:  water  streaming  down  gently,  and  then  spreading, \\nspreading  irresistibly  all  round  the  house  into  a  dark  shoreless \\npool.  It  gurgled  under  the  walls,  and  was  rising  slowly  but \\nsurely.  ‘I  shall  be  drowned!’  he  thought.  ‘It  will  find  its  way \\nin,  and  then  I  shall  drown.’  He  felt  that  he  was  lying  in  a  soft \\nslimy  bog,  and  springing  up  he  set  his  foot  on  the  corner  of \\na  cold  hard  flagstone.  Then  he  remembered  where  he  was \\nand  lay  down  again.  He  seemed  to  hear  or  remember  hearing: \\n‘Nothing  passes  doors  or  windows  save  moonlight  and  star¬ \\nlight  and  the  wind  off  the  hill -top.’  A  little  breath  of  sweet  air \\nmoved  the  curtain.  He  breathed  deep  and  fell  asleep  again. \\n\\nAs  far  as  he  could  remember,  Sam  slept  through  the  night \\nin  deep  content,  if  logs  are  contented. \\n\\nThey  woke  up,  all  four  at  once,  in  the  morning  light.  Tom \\nwas  moving  about  the  room  whistling  like  a  starling.  When \\nhe  heard  them  stir  he  clapped  his  hands,  and  cried:  ‘Hey! \\nCome  merry  dol!  derry  dol!  My  hearties!’  He  drew  back  the \\nyellow  curtains,  and  the  hobbits  saw  that  these  had  covered \\nthe  windows,  at  either  end  of  the  room,  one  looking  east  and \\nthe  other  looking  west. \\n\\nThey  leapt  up  refreshed.  Frodo  ran  to  the  eastern  window, \\nand  found  himself  looking  into  a  kitchen-garden  grey  with \\ndew.  He  had  half  expected  to  see  turf  right  up  to  the  walls, \\n\\n\\ni68 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nturf  all  pocked  with  hoof-prints.  Actually  his  view  was \\nscreened  by  a  tall  line  of  beans  on  poles;  but  above  and  far \\nbeyond  them  the  grey  top  of  the  hill  loomed  up  against  the \\nsunrise.  It  was  a  pale  morning:  in  the  East,  behind  long  clouds \\nlike  lines  of  soiled  wool  stained  red  at  the  edges,  lay  glimmer¬ \\ning  deeps  of  yellow.  The  sky  spoke  of  rain  to  come;  but  the \\nlight  was  broadening  quickly,  and  the  red  flowers  on  the \\nbeans  began  to  glow  against  the  wet  green  leaves. \\n\\nPippin  looked  out  of  the  western  window,  down  into  a  pool \\nof  mist.  The  Forest  was  hidden  under  a  fog.  It  was  like \\nlooking  down  on  to  a  sloping  cloud-roof  from  above.  There \\nwas  a  fold  or  channel  where  the  mist  was  broken  into  many \\nplumes  and  billows:  the  valley  of  the  Withywindle.  The \\nstream  ran  down  the  hill  on  the  left  and  vanished  into  the \\nwhite  shadows.  Near  at  hand  was  a  flower-garden  and  a \\nclipped  hedge  silver-netted,  and  beyond  that  grey  shaven \\ngrass  pale  with  dew-drops.  There  was  no  willow-tree  to  be \\nseen. \\n\\n‘Good  morning,  merry  friends!’  cried  Tom,  opening  the \\neastern  window  wide.  A  cool  air  flowed  in;  it  had  a  rainy \\nsmell.  ‘Sun  won’t  show  her  face  much  today,  I’m  thinking.  I \\nhave  been  walking  wide,  leaping  on  the  hill-tops,  since  the \\ngrey  dawn  began,  nosing  wind  and  weather,  wet  grass  under¬ \\nfoot,  wet  sky  above  me.  I  wakened  Goldberry  singing \\nunder  window;  but  naught  wakes  hobbit-folk  in  the  early \\nmorning.  In  the  night  little  folk  wake  up  in  the  darkness,  and \\nsleep  after  light  has  come!  Ring  a  ding  dillo!  Wake  now,  my \\nmerry  friends!  Forget  the  nightly  noises!  Ring  a  ding  dillo \\ndel!  derry  del,  my  hearties!  If  you  come  soon  you’ll  find \\nbreakfast  on  the  table.  If  you  come  late  you’ll  get  grass  and \\nrain-water!’ \\n\\nNeedless  to  say  -  not  that  Tom’s  threat  sounded  very \\nserious  -  the  hobbits  came  soon,  and  left  the  table  late  and \\nonly  when  it  was  beginning  to  look  rather  empty.  Neither \\nTom  nor  Goldberry  were  there.  Tom  could  be  heard  about \\nthe  house,  clattering  in  the  kitchen,  and  up  and  down  the \\nstairs,  and  singing  here  and  there  outside.  The  room  looked \\n\\n\\nIN  THE  HOUSE  OF  TOM  BOMBADIL  169 \\n\\nwestward  over  the  mist-clouded  valley,  and  the  window  was \\nopen.  Water  dripped  down  from  the  thatched  eaves  above. \\nBefore  they  had  finished  breakfast  the  clouds  had  joined  into \\nan  unbroken  roof,  and  a  straight  grey  rain  came  softly  and \\nsteadily  down.  Behind  its  deep  curtain  the  Forest  was  com¬ \\npletely  veiled. \\n\\nAs  they  looked  out  of  the  window  there  came  falling  gently \\nas  if  it  was  flowing  down  the  rain  out  of  the  sky,  the  clear \\nvoice  of  Goldberry  singing  up  above  them.  They  could  hear \\nfew  words,  but  it  seemed  plain  to  them  that  the  song  was  a \\nrain-song,  as  sweet  as  showers  on  dry  hills,  that  told  the  tale \\nof  a  river  from  the  spring  in  the  highlands  to  the  Sea  far \\nbelow.  The  hobbits  listened  with  delight;  and  Frodo  was  glad \\nin  his  heart,  and  blessed  the  kindly  weather,  because  it \\ndelayed  them  from  departing.  The  thought  of  going  had  been \\nheavy  upon  him  from  the  moment  he  awoke;  but  he  guessed \\nnow  that  they  would  not  go  further  that  day. \\n\\nThe  upper  wind  settled  in  the  West  and  deeper  and  wetter \\nclouds  rolled  up  to  spill  their  laden  rain  on  the  bare  heads  of \\nthe  Downs.  Nothing  could  be  seen  all  round  the  house  but \\nfalling  water.  Frodo  stood  near  the  open  door  and  watched \\nthe  white  chalky  path  turn  into  a  little  river  of  milk  and  go \\nbubbling  away  down  into  the  valley.  Tom  Bombadil  came \\ntrotting  round  the  corner  of  the  house,  waving  his  arms  as  if \\nhe  was  warding  off  the  rain  -  and  indeed  when  he  sprang \\nover  the  threshold  he  seemed  quite  dry,  except  for  his  boots. \\nThese  he  took  off  and  put  in  the  chimney-corner.  Then  he \\nsat  in  the  largest  chair  and  called  the  hobbits  to  gather  round \\nhim. \\n\\n‘This  is  Goldberry’s  washing  day,’  he  said,  ‘and  her \\nautumn-cleaning.  Too  wet  for  hobbit-folk  -  let  them  rest \\nwhile  they  are  able!  It’s  a  good  day  for  long  tales,  for  questions \\nand  for  answers,  so  Tom  will  start  the  talking.’ \\n\\nHe  then  told  them  many  remarkable  stories,  sometimes \\nhalf  as  if  speaking  to  himself,  sometimes  looking  at  them \\nsuddenly  with  a  bright  blue  eye  under  his  deep  brows.  Often \\n\\n\\n170  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nhis  voice  would  turn  to  song,  and  he  would  get  out  of  his \\nchair  and  dance  about.  He  told  them  tales  of  bees  and  flowers, \\nthe  ways  of  trees,  and  the  strange  creatures  of  the  Forest, \\nabout  the  evil  things  and  good  things,  things  friendly  and \\nthings  unfriendly,  cruel  things  and  kind  things,  and  secrets \\nhidden  under  brambles. \\n\\nAs  they  listened,  they  began  to  understand  the  lives  of  the \\nForest,  apart  from  themselves,  indeed  to  feel  themselves  as \\nthe  strangers  where  all  other  things  were  at  home.  Moving \\nconstantly  in  and  out  of  his  talk  was  Old  Man  Willow,  and \\nFrodo  learned  now  enough  to  content  him,  indeed  more  than \\nenough,  for  it  was  not  comfortable  lore.  Tom’s  words  laid \\nbare  the  hearts  of  trees  and  their  thoughts,  which  were  often \\ndark  and  strange,  and  filled  with  a  hatred  of  things  that  go  free \\nupon  the  earth,  gnawing,  biting,  breaking,  hacking,  burning: \\ndestroyers  and  usurpers.  It  was  not  called  the  Old  Forest \\nwithout  reason,  for  it  was  indeed  ancient,  a  survivor  of  vast \\nforgotten  woods;  and  in  it  there  lived  yet,  ageing  no  quicker \\nthan  the  hills,  the  fathers  of  the  fathers  of  trees,  remembering \\ntimes  when  they  were  lords.  The  countless  years  had  filled \\nthem  with  pride  and  rooted  wisdom,  and  with  malice.  But \\nnone  were  more  dangerous  than  the  Great  Willow:  his  heart \\nwas  rotten,  but  his  strength  was  green;  and  he  was  cunning, \\nand  a  master  of  winds,  and  his  song  and  thought  ran  through \\nthe  woods  on  both  sides  of  the  river.  His  grey  thirsty  spirit \\ndrew  power  out  of  the  earth  and  spread  like  fine  root-threads \\nin  the  ground,  and  invisible  twig-fingers  in  the  air,  till  it  had \\nunder  its  dominion  nearly  all  the  trees  of  the  Forest  from  the \\nHedge  to  the  Downs. \\n\\nSuddenly  Tom’s  talk  left  the  woods  and  went  leaping  up \\nthe  young  stream,  over  bubbling  waterfalls,  over  pebbles  and \\nworn  rocks,  and  among  small  flowers  in  close  grass  and  wet \\ncrannies,  wandering  at  last  up  on  to  the  Downs.  They  heard \\nof  the  Great  Barrows,  and  the  green  mounds,  and  the  stone- \\nrings  upon  the  hills  and  in  the  hollows  among  the  hills.  Sheep \\nwere  bleating  in  flocks.  Green  walls  and  white  walls  rose. \\nThere  were  fortresses  on  the  heights.  Kings  of  little  kingdoms \\n\\n\\nIN  THE  HOUSE  OF  TOM  BOMBADIL  171 \\n\\nfought  together,  and  the  young  Sun  shone  like  fire  on  the  red \\nmetal  of  their  new  and  greedy  swords.  There  was  victory  and \\ndefeat;  and  towers  fell,  fortresses  were  burned,  and  flames \\nwent  up  into  the  sky.  Gold  was  piled  on  the  biers  of  dead \\nkings  and  queens;  and  mounds  covered  them,  and  the  stone \\ndoors  were  shut;  and  the  grass  grew  over  all.  Sheep  walked \\nfor  a  while  biting  the  grass,  but  soon  the  hills  were  empty \\nagain.  A  shadow  came  out  of  dark  places  far  away,  and  the \\nbones  were  stirred  in  the  mounds.  Barrow-wights  walked  in \\nthe  hollow  places  with  a  clinic  of  rings  on  cold  fingers,  and \\ngold  chains  in  the  wind.  Stone  rings  grinned  out  of  the  ground \\nlike  broken  teeth  in  the  moonlight. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  shuddered.  Even  in  the  Shire  the  rumour  of \\nthe  Barrow-wights  of  the  Barrow-downs  beyond  the  Forest \\nhad  been  heard.  But  it  was  not  a  tale  that  any  hobbit  liked  to \\nlisten  to,  even  by  a  comfortable  fireside  far  away.  These  four \\nnow  suddenly  remembered  what  the  joy  of  this  house  had \\ndriven  from  their  minds:  the  house  of  Tom  Bombadil  nestled \\nunder  the  very  shoulder  of  those  dreaded  hills.  They  lost  the \\nthread  of  his  tale  and  shifted  uneasily,  looking  aside  at  one \\nanother. \\n\\nWhen  they  caught  his  words  again  they  found  that  he  had \\nnow  wandered  into  strange  regions  beyond  their  memory  and \\nbeyond  their  waking  thought,  into  times  when  the  world  was \\nwider,  and  the  seas  flowed  straight  to  the  western  Shore;  and \\nstill  on  and  back  Tom  went  singing  out  into  ancient  starlight, \\nwhen  only  the  Elf-sires  were  awake.  Then  suddenly  he \\nstopped,  and  they  saw  that  he  nodded  as  if  he  was  falling \\nasleep.  The  hobbits  sat  still  before  him,  enchanted;  and  it \\nseemed  as  if,  under  the  spell  of  his  words,  the  wind  had \\ngone,  and  the  clouds  had  dried  up,  and  the  day  had  been \\nwithdrawn,  and  darkness  had  come  from  East  and  West,  and \\nall  the  sky  was  filled  with  the  light  of  white  stars. \\n\\nWhether  the  morning  and  evening  of  one  day  or  of  many \\ndays  had  passed  Frodo  could  not  tell.  He  did  not  feel  either \\nhungry  or  tired,  only  filled  with  wonder.  The  stars  shone \\nthrough  the  window  and  the  silence  of  the  heavens  seemed \\n\\n\\n172 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nto  be  round  him.  He  spoke  at  last  out  of  his  wonder  and  a \\nsudden  fear  of  that  silence: \\n\\n‘Who  are  you,  Master?’  he  asked. \\n\\n‘Eh,  what?’  said  Tom  sitting  up,  and  his  eyes  glinting  in \\nthe  gloom.  ‘Don’t  you  know  my  name  yet?  That’s  the  only \\nanswer.  Tell  me,  who  are  you,  alone,  yourself  and  nameless? \\nBut  you  are  young  and  I  am  old.  Eldest,  that’s  what  I  am. \\nMark  my  words,  my  friends:  Tom  was  here  before  the  river \\nand  the  trees;  Tom  remembers  the  first  raindrop  and  the  first \\nacorn.  He  made  paths  before  the  Big  People,  and  saw  the \\nlittle  People  arriving.  He  was  here  before  the  Kings  and  the \\ngraves  and  the  Barrow- wights.  When  the  Elves  passed  west¬ \\nward,  Tom  was  here  already,  before  the  seas  were  bent.  He \\nknew  the  dark  under  the  stars  when  it  was  fearless  -  before \\nthe  Dark  Lord  came  from  Outside.’ \\n\\nA  shadow  seemed  to  pass  by  the  window,  and  the  hobbits \\nglanced  hastily  through  the  panes.  When  they  turned  again, \\nGoldberry  stood  in  the  door  behind,  framed  in  light.  She  held \\na  candle,  shielding  its  flame  from  the  draught  with  her  hand; \\nand  the  light  flowed  through  it,  like  sunlight  through  a  white \\nshell. \\n\\n‘The  rain  has  ended,’  she  said;  ‘and  new  waters  are  running \\ndownhill,  under  the  stars.  Let  us  now  laugh  and  be  glad!’ \\n\\n‘And  let  us  have  food  and  drink!’  cried  Tom.  ‘Long  tales \\nare  thirsty.  And  long  listening’s  hungry  work,  morning,  noon, \\nand  evening!’  With  that  he  jumped  out  of  his  chair,  and  with \\na  bound  took  a  candle  from  the  chimney-shelf  and  lit  it  in \\nthe  flame  that  Goldberry  held;  then  he  danced  about  the \\ntable.  Suddenly  he  hopped  through  the  door  and  dis¬ \\nappeared. \\n\\nQuickly  he  returned,  bearing  a  large  and  laden  tray.  Then \\nTom  and  Goldberry  set  the  table;  and  the  hobbits  sat  half  in \\nwonder  and  half  in  laughter:  so  fair  was  the  grace  of  Gold¬ \\nberry  and  so  merry  and  odd  the  caperings  of  Tom.  Yet  in \\nsome  fashion  they  seemed  to  weave  a  single  dance,  neither \\nhindering  the  other,  in  and  out  of  the  room,  and  round  about \\nthe  table;  and  with  great  speed  food  and  vessels  and  lights \\n\\n\\nIN  THE  HOUSE  OF  TOM  BOMBADIL  1 73 \\n\\nwere  set  in  order.  The  boards  blazed  with  candles,  white  and \\nyellow.  Tom  bowed  to  his  guests.  ‘Supper  is  ready,’  said \\nGoldberry;  and  now  the  hobbits  saw  that  she  was  clothed  all \\nin  silver  with  a  white  girdle,  and  her  shoes  were  like  fishes’ \\nmail.  But  Tom  was  all  in  clean  blue,  blue  as  rain-washed \\nforget-me-nots,  and  he  had  green  stockings. \\n\\nIt  was  a  supper  even  better  than  before.  The  hobbits  under \\nthe  spell  of  Tom’s  words  may  have  missed  one  meal  or  many, \\nbut  when  the  food  was  before  them  it  seemed  at  least  a  week \\nsince  they  had  eaten.  They  did  not  sing  or  even  speak  much \\nfor  a  while,  and  paid  close  attention  to  business.  But  after  a \\ntime  their  hearts  and  spirits  rose  high  again,  and  their  voices \\nrang  out  in  mirth  and  laughter. \\n\\nAfter  they  had  eaten,  Goldberry  sang  many  songs  for  them, \\nsongs  that  began  merrily  in  the  hills  and  fell  softly  down  into \\nsilence;  and  in  the  silences  they  saw  in  their  minds  pools  and \\nwaters  wider  than  any  they  had  known,  and  looking  into  them \\nthey  saw  the  sky  below  them  and  the  stars  like  jewels  in  the \\ndepths.  Then  once  more  she  wished  them  each  good  night \\nand  left  them  by  the  fireside.  But  Tom  now  seemed  wide \\nawake  and  plied  them  with  questions. \\n\\nHe  appeared  already  to  know  much  about  them  and  all \\ntheir  families,  and  indeed  to  know  much  of  all  the  history \\nand  doings  of  the  Shire  down  from  days  hardly  remembered \\namong  the  hobbits  themselves.  It  no  longer  surprised  them; \\nbut  he  made  no  secret  that  he  owed  his  recent  knowledge \\nlargely  to  Farmer  Maggot,  whom  he  seemed  to  regard  as  a \\nperson  of  more  importance  than  they  had  imagined.  ‘There’s \\nearth  under  his  old  feet,  and  clay  on  his  fingers;  wisdom  in \\nhis  bones,  and  both  his  eyes  are  open,’  said  Tom.  It  was  also \\nclear  that  Tom  had  dealings  with  the  Elves,  and  it  seemed \\nthat  in  some  fashion,  news  had  reached  him  from  Gildor \\nconcerning  the  flight  of  Frodo. \\n\\nIndeed  so  much  did  Tom  know,  and  so  cunning  was  his \\nquestioning,  that  Frodo  found  himself  telling  him  more  about \\nBilbo  and  his  own  hopes  and  fears  than  he  had  told  before \\n\\n\\n174 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\neven  to  Gandalf.  Tom  wagged  his  head  up  and  down,  and \\nthere  was  a  glint  in  his  eyes  when  he  heard  of  the  Riders. \\n\\n‘Show  me  the  precious  Ring!’  he  said  suddenly  in  the  midst \\nof  the  story:  and  Frodo,  to  his  own  astonishment,  drew  out \\nthe  chain  from  his  pocket,  and  unfastening  the  Ring  handed \\nit  at  once  to  Tom. \\n\\nIt  seemed  to  grow  larger  as  it  lay  for  a  moment  on  his  big \\nbrown-skinned  hand.  Then  suddenly  he  put  it  to  his  eye  and \\nlaughed.  For  a  second  the  hobbits  had  a  vision,  both  comical \\nand  alarming,  of  his  bright  blue  eye  gleaming  through  a  circle \\nof  gold.  Then  Tom  put  the  Ring  round  the  end  of  his  little \\nfinger  and  held  it  up  to  the  candlelight.  For  a  moment \\nthe  hobbits  noticed  nothing  strange  about  this.  Then  they \\ngasped.  There  was  no  sign  of  Tom  disappearing! \\n\\nTom  laughed  again,  and  then  he  spun  the  Ring  in  the  air \\n-  and  it  vanished  with  a  flash.  Frodo  gave  a  cry  -  and  Tom \\nleaned  forward  and  handed  it  back  to  him  with  a  smile. \\n\\nFrodo  looked  at  it  closely,  and  rather  suspiciously  (like  one \\nwho  has  lent  a  trinket  to  a  juggler) .  It  was  the  same  Ring,  or \\nlooked  the  same  and  weighed  the  same:  for  that  Ring  had \\nalways  seemed  to  Frodo  to  weigh  strangely  heavy  in  the  hand. \\nBut  something  prompted  him  to  make  sure.  He  was  perhaps \\na  trifle  annoyed  with  Tom  for  seeming  to  make  so  light  of \\nwhat  even  Gandalf  thought  so  perilously  important.  He \\nwaited  for  an  opportunity,  when  the  talk  was  going  again, \\nand  Tom  was  telling  an  absurd  story  about  badgers  and  their \\nqueer  ways  -  then  he  slipped  the  Ring  on. \\n\\nMerry  turned  towards  him  to  say  something  and  gave  a \\nstart,  and  checked  an  exclamation.  Frodo  was  delighted  (in \\na  way):  it  was  his  own  ring  all  right,  for  Merry  was  staring \\nblankly  at  his  chair,  and  obviously  could  not  see  him.  He  got \\nup  and  crept  quietly  away  from  the  fireside  towards  the  outer \\ndoor. \\n\\n‘Hey  there!’  cried  Tom,  glancing  towards  him  with  a  most \\nseeing  look  in  his  shining  eyes.  ‘Hey!  Come  Frodo,  there! \\nWhere  be  you  a-going?  Old  Tom  Bombadil’s  not  as  blind  as \\nthat  yet.  Take  off  your  golden  ring!  Your  hand’s  more  fair \\n\\n\\nIN  THE  HOUSE  OF  TOM  BOMBADIL  1 75 \\n\\nwithout  it.  Come  back!  Leave  your  game  and  sit  down  beside \\nme!  We  must  talk  a  while  more,  and  think  about  the  morning. \\nTom  must  teach  the  right  road,  and  keep  your  feet  from \\nwandering.’ \\n\\nFrodo  laughed  (trying  to  feel  pleased),  and  taking  off  the \\nRing  he  came  and  sat  down  again.  Tom  now  told  them  that \\nhe  reckoned  the  Sun  would  shine  tomorrow,  and  it  would  be \\na  glad  morning,  and  setting  out  would  be  hopeful.  But  they \\nwould  do  well  to  start  early;  for  weather  in  that  country  was \\na  thing  that  even  Tom  could  not  be  sure  of  for  long,  and  it \\nwould  change  sometimes  quicker  than  he  could  change  his \\njacket.  ‘I  am  no  weather-master,’  said  he;  ‘nor  is  aught  that \\ngoes  on  two  legs.’ \\n\\nBy  his  advice  they  decided  to  make  nearly  due  North  from \\nhis  house,  over  the  western  and  lower  slopes  of  the  Downs: \\nthey  might  hope  in  that  way  to  strike  the  East  Road  in  a  day’s \\njourney,  and  avoid  the  Barrows.  He  told  them  not  to  be  afraid \\n-  but  to  mind  their  own  business. \\n\\n‘Keep  to  the  green  grass.  Don’t  you  go  a-meddling  with \\nold  stone  or  cold  Wights  or  prying  in  their  houses,  unless  you \\nbe  strong  folic  with  hearts  that  never  falter!’  He  said  this  more \\nthan  once;  and  he  advised  them  to  pass  barrows  by  on  the \\nwest-side,  if  they  chanced  to  stray  near  one.  Then  he  taught \\nthem  a  rhyme  to  sing,  if  they  should  by  ill-luck  fall  into  any \\ndanger  or  difficulty  the  next  day. \\n\\nHo!  Tom  Bombadil,  Tom  Bombadillo! \\n\\nBy  water,  wood  and  hill,  by  the  reed  and  willow, \\n\\nBy  fire,  sun  and  moon,  harken  now  and  hear  us! \\n\\nCome,  Tom  Bombadil,  for  our  need  is  near  us! \\n\\nWhen  they  had  sung  this  altogether  after  him,  he  clapped \\nthem  each  on  the  shoulder  with  a  laugh,  and  taking  candles \\nled  them  back  to  their  bedroom. \\n\\n\\nChapter  8 \\n\\n\\nFOG  ON  THE  BARROW-DOWNS \\n\\n\\nThat  night  they  heard  no  noises.  But  either  in  his  dreams  or \\nout  of  them,  he  could  not  tell  which,  Frodo  heard  a  sweet \\nsinging  running  in  his  mind:  a  song  that  seemed  to  come  like \\na  pale  light  behind  a  grey  rain-curtain,  and  growing  stronger \\nto  turn  the  veil  all  to  glass  and  silver,  until  at  last  it  was  rolled \\nback,  and  a  far  green  country  opened  before  him  under  a \\nswift  sunrise. \\n\\nThe  vision  melted  into  waking;  and  there  was  Tom  whist¬ \\nling  like  a  tree-full  of  birds;  and  the  sun  was  already  slanting \\ndown  the  hill  and  through  the  open  window.  Outside  every¬ \\nthing  was  green  and  pale  gold. \\n\\nAfter  breakfast,  which  they  again  ate  alone,  they  made \\nready  to  say  farewell,  as  nearly  heavy  of  heart  as  was  possible \\non  such  a  morning:  cool,  bright,  and  clean  under  a  washed \\nautumn  sky  of  thin  blue.  The  air  came  fresh  from  the  North¬ \\nwest.  Their  quiet  ponies  were  almost  frisky,  sniffing  and \\nmoving  restlessly.  Tom  came  out  of  the  house  and  waved  his \\nhat  and  danced  upon  the  doorstep,  bidding  the  hobbits  to \\nget  up  and  be  off  and  go  with  good  speed. \\n\\nThey  rode  off  along  a  path  that  wound  away  from  behind \\nthe  house,  and  went  slanting  up  towards  the  north  end  of  the \\nhill-brow  under  which  it  sheltered.  They  had  just  dismounted \\nto  lead  their  ponies  up  the  last  steep  slope,  when  suddenly \\nFrodo  stopped. \\n\\n‘Goldberry!’  he  cried.  ‘My  fair  lady,  clad  all  in  silver  green! \\nWe  have  never  said  farewell  to  her,  nor  seen  her  since  the \\nevening!’  He  was  so  distressed  that  he  turned  back;  but  at \\nthat  moment  a  clear  call  came  rippling  down.  There  on  the \\nhill-brow  she  stood  beckoning  to  them:  her  hair  was  flying \\nloose,  and  as  it  caught  the  sun  it  shone  and  shimmered.  A \\n\\n\\nFOG  ON  THE  BARROW-DOWNS  177 \\n\\nlight  like  the  glint  of  water  on  dewy  grass  flashed  from  under \\nher  feet  as  she  danced. \\n\\nThey  hastened  up  the  last  slope,  and  stood  breathless \\nbeside  her.  They  bowed,  but  with  a  wave  of  her  arm  she  bade \\nthem  look  round;  and  they  looked  out  from  the  hill-top  over \\nlands  under  the  morning.  It  was  now  as  clear  and  far-seen  as \\nit  had  been  veiled  and  misty  when  they  stood  upon  the  knoll \\nin  the  Forest,  which  could  now  be  seen  rising  pale  and  green \\nout  of  the  dark  trees  in  the  West.  In  that  direction  the  land \\nrose  in  wooded  ridges,  green,  yellow,  russet  under  the  sun, \\nbeyond  which  lay  hidden  the  valley  of  the  Brandywine.  To \\nthe  South,  over  the  line  of  the  Withywindle,  there  was  a \\ndistant  glint  like  pale  glass  where  the  Brandywine  River  made \\na  great  loop  in  the  lowlands  and  flowed  away  out  of  the \\nknowledge  of  the  hobbits.  Northward  beyond  the  dwindling \\ndowns  the  land  ran  away  in  flats  and  swellings  of  grey  and \\ngreen  and  pale  earth-colours,  until  it  faded  into  a  featureless \\nand  shadowy  distance.  Eastward  the  Barrow-downs  rose, \\nridge  behind  ridge  into  the  morning,  and  vanished  out  of \\neyesight  into  a  guess:  it  was  no  more  than  a  guess  of  blue  and \\na  remote  white  glimmer  blending  with  the  hem  of  the  sky, \\nbut  it  spoke  to  them,  out  of  memory  and  old  tales,  of  the \\nhigh  and  distant  mountains. \\n\\nThey  took  a  deep  draught  of  the  air,  and  felt  that  a  skip  and \\na  few  stout  strides  would  bear  them  wherever  they  wished.  It \\nseemed  fainthearted  to  go  jogging  aside  over  the  crumpled \\nskirts  of  the  downs  towards  the  Road,  when  they  should  be \\nleaping,  as  lusty  as  Tom,  over  the  stepping  stones  of  the  hills \\nstraight  towards  the  Mountains. \\n\\nGoldberry  spoke  to  them  and  recalled  their  eyes  and \\nthoughts.  ‘Speed  now,  fair  guests!’  she  said.  ‘And  hold  to \\nyour  purpose!  North  with  the  wind  in  the  left  eye  and  a \\nblessing  on  your  footsteps!  Make  haste  while  the  Sun  shines!’ \\nAnd  to  Frodo  she  said:  ‘Farewell,  Elf-friend,  it  was  a  merry \\nmeeting!’ \\n\\nBut  Frodo  found  no  words  to  answer.  He  bowed  low,  and \\nmounted  his  pony,  and  followed  by  his  friends  jogged  slowly \\n\\n\\n178 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\ndown  the  gentle  slope  behind  the  hill.  Tom  Bombadil’s  house \\nand  the  valley,  and  the  Forest  were  lost  to  view.  The  air  grew \\nwarmer  between  the  green  walls  of  hillside  and  hillside,  and \\nthe  scent  of  turf  rose  strong  and  sweet  as  they  breathed. \\nTurning  back,  when  they  reached  the  bottom  of  the  green \\nhollow,  they  saw  Goldberry,  now  small  and  slender  like  a \\nsunlit  flower  against  the  sky:  she  was  standing  still  watching \\nthem,  and  her  hands  were  stretched  out  towards  them.  As \\nthey  looked  she  gave  a  clear  call,  and  lifting  up  her  hand  she \\nturned  and  vanished  behind  the  hill. \\n\\nTheir  way  wound  along  the  floor  of  the  hollow,  and  round \\nthe  green  feet  of  a  steep  hill  into  another  deeper  and  broader \\nvalley,  and  then  over  the  shoulders  of  further  hills,  and  down \\ntheir  long  limbs,  and  up  their  smooth  sides  again,  up  on  to \\nnew  hill-tops  and  down  into  new  valleys.  There  was  no  tree \\nnor  any  visible  water:  it  was  a  country  of  grass  and  short \\nspringy  turf,  silent  except  for  the  whisper  of  the  air  over  the \\nedges  of  the  land,  and  high  lonely  cries  of  strange  birds.  As \\nthey  journeyed  the  sun  mounted,  and  grew  hot.  Each  time \\nthey  climbed  a  ridge  the  breeze  seemed  to  have  grown  less. \\nWhen  they  caught  a  glimpse  of  the  country  westward  the \\ndistant  Forest  seemed  to  be  smoking,  as  if  the  fallen  rain  was \\nsteaming  up  again  from  leaf  and  root  and  mould.  A  shadow \\nnow  lay  round  the  edge  of  sight,  a  dark  haze  above  which  the \\nupper  sky  was  like  a  blue  cap,  hot  and  heavy. \\n\\nAbout  mid-day  they  came  to  a  hill  whose  top  was  wide \\nand  flattened,  like  a  shallow  saucer  with  a  green  mounded \\nrim.  Inside  there  was  no  air  stirring,  and  the  sky  seemed  near \\ntheir  heads.  They  rode  across  and  looked  northwards.  Then \\ntheir  hearts  rose;  for  it  seemed  plain  that  they  had  come \\nfurther  already  than  they  had  expected.  Certainly  the  dis¬ \\ntances  had  now  all  become  hazy  and  deceptive,  but  there \\ncould  be  no  doubt  that  the  Downs  were  coming  to  an  end. \\nA  long  valley  lay  below  them  winding  away  northwards,  until \\nit  came  to  an  opening  between  two  steep  shoulders.  Beyond, \\nthere  seemed  to  be  no  more  hills.  Due  north  they  faintly \\n\\n\\nFOG  ON  THE  BARROW-DOWNS \\n\\n\\n179 \\n\\n\\nglimpsed  a  long  dark  line.  ‘That  is  a  line  of  trees,’  said  Merry, \\n‘and  that  must  mark  the  Road.  All  along  it  for  many  leagues \\neast  of  the  Bridge  there  are  trees  growing.  Some  say  they \\nwere  planted  in  the  old  days.’ \\n\\n‘Splendid!’  said  Frodo.  ‘If  we  make  as  good  going  this \\nafternoon  as  we  have  done  this  morning,  we  shall  have  left \\nthe  Downs  before  the  Sun  sets  and  be  jogging  on  in  search \\nof  a  camping  place.’  But  even  as  he  spoke  he  turned  his \\nglance  eastwards,  and  he  saw  that  on  that  side  the  hills  were \\nhigher  and  looked  down  upon  them;  and  all  those  hills  were \\ncrowned  with  green  mounds,  and  on  some  were  standing \\nstones,  pointing  upwards  like  jagged  teeth  out  of  green  gums. \\n\\nThat  view  was  somehow  disquieting;  so  they  turned  from \\nthe  sight  and  went  down  into  the  hollow  circle.  In  the  midst \\nof  it  there  stood  a  single  stone,  standing  tall  under  the  sun \\nabove,  and  at  this  hour  casting  no  shadow.  It  was  shapeless \\nand  yet  significant:  like  a  landmark,  or  a  guarding  finger,  or \\nmore  like  a  warning.  But  they  were  now  hungry,  and  the  sun \\nwas  still  at  the  fearless  noon;  so  they  set  their  backs  against \\nthe  east  side  of  the  stone.  It  was  cool,  as  if  the  sun  had  had \\nno  power  to  warm  it;  but  at  that  time  this  seemed  pleasant. \\nThere  they  took  food  and  drink,  and  made  as  good  a  noon- \\nmeal  under  the  open  sky  as  anyone  could  wish;  for  the  food \\ncame  from  ‘down  under  Hill’.  Tom  had  provided  them  with \\nplenty  for  the  comfort  of  the  day.  Their  ponies  unburdened \\nstrayed  upon  the  grass. \\n\\nRiding  over  the  hills,  and  eating  their  fill,  the  warm  sun \\nand  the  scent  of  turf,  lying  a  little  too  long,  stretching  out \\ntheir  legs  and  looking  at  the  sky  above  their  noses:  these \\nthings  are,  perhaps,  enough  to  explain  what  happened.  How¬ \\never  that  may  be:  they  woke  suddenly  and  uncomfortably \\nfrom  a  sleep  they  had  never  meant  to  take.  The  standing \\nstone  was  cold,  and  it  cast  a  long  pale  shadow  that  stretched \\neastward  over  them.  The  sun,  a  pale  and  watery  yellow,  was \\ngleaming  through  the  mist  just  above  the  west  wall  of  the \\nhollow  in  which  they  lay;  north,  south,  and  east,  beyond  the \\n\\n\\ni8o \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nwall  the  fog  was  thick,  cold  and  white.  The  air  was  silent, \\nheavy  and  chill.  Their  ponies  were  standing  crowded  together \\nwith  their  heads  down. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  sprang  to  their  feet  in  alarm,  and  ran  to  the \\nwestern  rim.  They  found  that  they  were  upon  an  island  in \\nthe  fog.  Even  as  they  looked  out  in  dismay  towards  the  setting \\nsun,  it  sank  before  their  eyes  into  a  white  sea,  and  a  cold  grey \\nshadow  sprang  up  in  the  East  behind.  The  fog  rolled  up  to \\nthe  walls  and  rose  above  them,  and  as  it  mounted  it  bent  over \\ntheir  heads  until  it  became  a  roof:  they  were  shut  in  a  hall  of \\nmist  whose  central  pillar  was  the  standing  stone. \\n\\nThey  felt  as  if  a  trap  was  closing  about  them;  but  they  did \\nnot  quite  lose  heart.  They  still  remembered  the  hopeful  view \\nthey  had  had  of  the  line  of  the  Road  ahead,  and  they  still \\nknew  in  which  direction  it  lay.  In  any  case,  they  now  had  so \\ngreat  a  dislike  for  that  hollow  place  about  the  stone  that  no \\nthought  of  remaining  there  was  in  their  minds.  They  packed \\nup  as  quickly  as  their  chilled  fingers  would  work. \\n\\nSoon  they  were  leading  their  ponies  in  single  file  over  the \\nrim  and  down  the  long  northward  slope  of  the  hill,  down  into \\na  foggy  sea.  As  they  went  down  the  mist  became  colder \\nand  damper,  and  their  hair  hung  lank  and  dripping  on  their \\nforeheads.  When  they  reached  the  bottom  it  was  so  chill  that \\nthey  halted  and  got  out  cloaks  and  hoods,  which  soon  became \\nbedewed  with  grey  drops.  Then,  mounting  their  ponies,  they \\nwent  slowly  on  again,  feeling  their  way  by  the  rise  and  fall  of \\nthe  ground.  They  were  steering,  as  well  as  they  could  guess, \\nfor  the  gate -like  opening  at  the  far  northward  end  of  the  long \\nvalley  which  they  had  seen  in  the  morning.  Once  they  were \\nthrough  the  gap,  they  had  only  to  keep  on  in  anything  like  a \\nstraight  line  and  they  were  bound  in  the  end  to  strike  the \\nRoad.  Their  thoughts  did  not  go  beyond  that,  except  for  a \\nvague  hope  that  perhaps  away  beyond  the  Downs  there  might \\nbe  no  fog. \\n\\nTheir  going  was  very  slow.  To  prevent  their  getting  separ¬ \\nated  and  wandering  in  different  directions  they  went  in  file, \\n\\n\\nFOG  ON  THE  BARROW-DOWNS  l8l \\n\\nwith  Frodo  leading.  Sam  was  behind  him,  and  after  him  came \\nPippin,  and  then  Merry.  The  valley  seemed  to  stretch  on \\nendlessly.  Suddenly  Frodo  saw  a  hopeful  sign.  On  either  side \\nahead  a  darkness  began  to  loom  through  the  mist;  and  he \\nguessed  that  they  were  at  last  approaching  the  gap  in  the \\nhills,  the  north-gate  of  the  Barrow-downs.  If  they  could  pass \\nthat,  they  would  be  free. \\n\\n‘Come  on!  Follow  me!’  he  called  back  over  his  shoulder, \\nand  he  hurried  forward.  But  his  hope  soon  changed  to  bewil¬ \\nderment  and  alarm.  The  dark  patches  grew  darker,  but  they \\nshrank;  and  suddenly  he  saw,  towering  ominous  before  him \\nand  leaning  slightly  towards  one  another  like  the  pillars  of \\na  headless  door,  two  huge  standing  stones.  He  could  not \\nremember  having  seen  any  sign  of  these  in  the  valley,  when \\nhe  looked  out  from  the  hill  in  the  morning.  He  had  passed \\nbetween  them  almost  before  he  was  aware:  and  even  as  he \\ndid  so  darkness  seemed  to  fall  round  him.  His  pony  reared \\nand  snorted,  and  he  fell  off.  When  he  looked  back  he  found \\nthat  he  was  alone:  the  others  had  not  followed  him. \\n\\n‘Sam!’  he  called.  ‘Pippin!  Merry!  Come  along!  Why  don’t \\nyou  keep  up?’ \\n\\nThere  was  no  answer.  Fear  took  him,  and  he  ran  back  past \\nthe  stones  shouting  wildly:  ‘Sam!  Sam!  Merry!  Pippin!’  The \\npony  bolted  into  the  mist  and  vanished.  From  some  way  off, \\nor  so  it  seemed,  he  thought  he  heard  a  cry:  ‘Hoy!  Frodo! \\nHoy!’  It  was  away  eastward,  on  his  left  as  he  stood  under  the \\ngreat  stones,  staring  and  straining  into  the  gloom.  He  plunged \\noff  in  the  direction  of  the  call,  and  found  himself  going  steeply \\nuphill. \\n\\nAs  he  struggled  on  he  called  again,  and  kept  on  calling \\nmore  and  more  frantically;  but  he  heard  no  answer  for  some \\ntime,  and  then  it  seemed  faint  and  far  ahead  and  high  above \\nhim.  ‘Frodo!  Hoy!’  came  the  thin  voices  out  of  the  mist:  and \\nthen  a  cry  that  sounded  like  help ,  help!  often  repeated,  ending \\nwith  a  last  help!  that  trailed  off  into  a  long  wail  suddenly  cut \\nshort.  He  stumbled  forward  with  all  the  speed  he  could \\ntowards  the  cries;  but  the  light  was  now  gone,  and  clinging \\n\\n\\ni82 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nnight  had  closed  about  him,  so  that  it  was  impossible  to  be \\nsure  of  any  direction.  He  seemed  all  the  time  to  be  climbing \\nup  and  up. \\n\\nOnly  the  change  in  the  level  of  the  ground  at  his  feet  told \\nhim  when  he  at  last  came  to  the  top  of  a  ridge  or  hill.  He  was \\nweary,  sweating  and  yet  chilled.  It  was  wholly  dark. \\n\\n‘Where  are  you?’  he  cried  out  miserably. \\n\\nThere  was  no  reply.  He  stood  listening.  He  was  suddenly \\naware  that  it  was  getting  very  cold,  and  that  up  here  a  wind \\nwas  beginning  to  blow,  an  icy  wind.  A  change  was  coming \\nin  the  weather.  The  mist  was  flowing  past  him  now  in  shreds \\nand  tatters.  His  breath  was  smoking,  and  the  darkness  was \\nless  near  and  thick.  He  looked  up  and  saw  with  surprise \\nthat  faint  stars  were  appearing  overhead  amid  the  strands  of \\nhurrying  cloud  and  fog.  The  wind  began  to  hiss  over  the \\ngrass. \\n\\nHe  imagined  suddenly  that  he  caught  a  muffled  cry,  and \\nhe  made  towards  it;  and  even  as  he  went  forward  the  mist  was \\nrolled  up  and  thrust  aside,  and  the  starry  sky  was  unveiled.  A \\nglance  showed  him  that  he  was  now  facing  southwards  and \\nwas  on  a  round  hill-top,  which  he  must  have  climbed  from \\nthe  north.  Out  of  the  east  the  biting  wind  was  blowing.  To \\nhis  right  there  loomed  against  the  westward  stars  a  dark  black \\nshape.  A  great  barrow  stood  there. \\n\\n‘Where  are  you?’  he  cried  again,  both  angry  and  afraid. \\n\\n‘Here!’  said  a  voice,  deep  and  cold,  that  seemed  to  come \\nout  of  the  ground.  ‘I  am  waiting  for  you!’ \\n\\n‘No!’  said  Frodo;  but  he  did  not  run  away.  His  knees  gave, \\nand  he  fell  on  the  ground.  Nothing  happened,  and  there  was \\nno  sound.  Trembling  he  looked  up,  in  time  to  see  a  tall  dark \\nfigure  like  a  shadow  against  the  stars.  It  leaned  over  him.  He \\nthought  there  were  two  eyes,  very  cold  though  lit  with  a  pale \\nlight  that  seemed  to  come  from  some  remote  distance.  Then \\na  grip  stronger  and  colder  than  iron  seized  him.  The  icy \\ntouch  froze  his  bones,  and  he  remembered  no  more. \\n\\n\\nFOG  ON  THE  BARROW-DOWNS  183 \\n\\nWhen  he  came  to  himself  again,  for  a  moment  he  could \\nrecall  nothing  except  a  sense  of  dread.  Then  suddenly  he \\nknew  that  he  was  imprisoned,  caught  hopelessly;  he  was  in  a \\nbarrow.  A  Barrow-wight  had  taken  him,  and  he  was  probably \\nalready  under  the  dreadful  spells  of  the  Barrow-wights  about \\nwhich  whispered  tales  spoke.  He  dared  not  move,  but  lay  as \\nhe  found  himself:  flat  on  his  back  upon  a  cold  stone  with  his \\nhands  on  his  breast. \\n\\nBut  though  his  fear  was  so  great  that  it  seemed  to  be  part \\nof  the  very  darkness  that  was  round  him,  he  found  himself \\nas  he  lay  thinking  about  Bilbo  Baggins  and  his  stories,  of  their \\njogging  along  together  in  the  lanes  of  the  Shire  and  talking \\nabout  roads  and  adventures.  There  is  a  seed  of  courage \\nhidden  (often  deeply,  it  is  true)  in  the  heart  of  the  fattest \\nand  most  timid  hobbit,  waiting  for  some  final  and  desperate \\ndanger  to  make  it  grow.  Frodo  was  neither  very  fat  nor  very \\ntimid;  indeed,  though  he  did  not  know  it,  Bilbo  (and \\nGandalf)  had  thought  him  the  best  hobbit  in  the  Shire.  He \\nthought  he  had  come  to  the  end  of  his  adventure,  and  a \\nterrible  end,  but  the  thought  hardened  him.  He  found  himself \\nstiffening,  as  if  for  a  final  spring;  he  no  longer  felt  limp  like  a \\nhelpless  prey. \\n\\nAs  he  lay  there,  thinking  and  getting  a  hold  of  himself,  he \\nnoticed  all  at  once  that  the  darkness  was  slowly  giving  way: \\na  pale  greenish  light  was  growing  round  him.  It  did  not  at \\nfirst  show  him  what  kind  of  a  place  he  was  in,  for  the  light \\nseemed  to  be  coming  out  of  himself,  and  from  the  floor  beside \\nhim,  and  had  not  yet  reached  the  roof  or  wall.  He  turned,  and \\nthere  in  the  cold  glow  he  saw  lying  beside  him  Sam,  Pippin, \\nand  Merry.  They  were  on  their  backs,  and  their  faces  looked \\ndeathly  pale;  and  they  were  clad  in  white.  About  them  lay \\nmany  treasures,  of  gold  maybe,  though  in  that  light  they \\nlooked  cold  and  unlovely.  On  their  heads  were  circlets,  gold \\nchains  were  about  their  waists,  and  on  their  fingers  were  many \\nrings.  Swords  lay  by  their  sides,  and  shields  were  at  their  feet. \\nBut  across  their  three  necks  lay  one  long  naked  sword. \\n\\n\\n1 84  THE  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nSuddenly  a  song  began:  a  cold  murmur,  rising  and  falling. \\nThe  voice  seemed  far  away  and  immeasurably  dreary,  some¬ \\ntimes  high  in  the  air  and  thin,  sometimes  like  a  low  moan \\nfrom  the  ground.  Out  of  the  formless  stream  of  sad  but \\nhorrible  sounds,  strings  of  words  would  now  and  again  shape \\nthemselves:  grim,  hard,  cold  words,  heartless  and  miserable. \\nThe  night  was  railing  against  the  morning  of  which  it  was \\nbereaved,  and  the  cold  was  cursing  the  warmth  for  which  it \\nhungered.  Frodo  was  chilled  to  the  marrow.  After  a  while  the \\nsong  became  clearer,  and  with  dread  in  his  heart  he  perceived \\nthat  it  had  changed  into  an  incantation: \\n\\nCold  be  hand  and  heart  and  bone, \\n\\nand  cold  be  sleep  under  stone: \\n\\nnever  more  to  wake  on  stony  bed, \\n\\nnever,  till  the  Sun  fails  and  the  Moon  is  dead. \\n\\nIn  the  black  wind  the  stars  shall  die, \\nand  still  on  gold  here  let  them  lie, \\ntill  the  dark  lord  lifts  his  hand \\nover  dead  sea  and  withered  land. \\n\\nHe  heard  behind  his  head  a  creaking  and  scraping  sound. \\nRaising  himself  on  one  arm  he  looked,  and  saw  now  in  the \\npale  light  that  they  were  in  a  kind  of  passage  which  behind \\nthem  turned  a  corner.  Round  the  corner  a  long  arm  was \\ngroping,  walking  on  its  fingers  towards  Sam,  who  was  lying \\nnearest,  and  towards  the  hilt  of  the  sword  that  lay  upon  him. \\n\\nAt  first  Frodo  felt  as  if  he  had  indeed  been  turned  into \\nstone  by  the  incantation.  Then  a  wild  thought  of  escape  came \\nto  him.  He  wondered  if  he  put  on  the  Ring,  whether  the \\nBarrow-wight  would  miss  him,  and  he  might  find  some  way \\nout.  He  thought  of  himself  running  free  over  the  grass,  griev¬ \\ning  for  Merry,  and  Sam,  and  Pippin,  but  free  and  alive  him¬ \\nself.  Gandalf  would  admit  that  there  had  been  nothing  else \\nhe  could  do. \\n\\nBut  the  courage  that  had  been  awakened  in  him  was  now \\ntoo  strong:  he  could  not  leave  his  friends  so  easily.  He \\n\\n\\nFOG  ON  THE  BARROW-DOWNS \\n\\n\\n185 \\n\\n\\nwavered,  groping  in  his  pocket,  and  then  fought  with  himself \\nagain;  and  as  he  did  so  the  arm  crept  nearer.  Suddenly  resolve \\nhardened  in  him,  and  he  seized  a  short  sword  that  lay  beside \\nhim,  and  kneeling  he  stooped  low  over  the  bodies  of  his \\ncompanions.  With  what  strength  he  had  he  hewed  at  the \\ncrawling  arm  near  the  wrist,  and  the  hand  broke  off;  but  at \\nthe  same  moment  the  sword  splintered  up  to  the  hilt.  There \\nwas  a  shriek  and  the  light  vanished.  In  the  dark  there  was  a \\nsnarling  noise. \\n\\nFrodo  fell  forward  over  Merry,  and  Merry’s  face  felt  cold. \\nAll  at  once  back  into  his  mind,  from  which  it  had  disappeared \\nwith  the  first  coming  of  the  fog,  came  the  memory  of  the \\nhouse  down  under  the  Hill,  and  of  Tom  singing.  He  re¬ \\nmembered  the  rhyme  that  Tom  had  taught  them.  In  a  small \\ndesperate  voice  he  began:  Ho!  Tom  Bombadil!  and  with  that \\nname  his  voice  seemed  to  grow  strong:  it  had  a  full  and \\nlively  sound,  and  the  dark  chamber  echoed  as  if  to  drum  and \\ntrumpet. \\n\\nHo!  Tom  Bombadil,  Tom  Bombadillo! \\n\\nBy  water,  wood  and  hill,  by  the  reed  and  willow, \\n\\nBy  fire,  sun  and  moon,  harken  now  and  hear  us! \\n\\nCome,  Tom  Bombadil,  for  our  need  is  near  us! \\n\\nThere  was  a  sudden  deep  silence,  in  which  Frodo  could \\nhear  his  heart  beating.  After  a  long  slow  moment  he  heard \\nplain,  but  far  away,  as  if  it  was  coming  down  through  the \\nground  or  through  thick  walls,  an  answering  voice  singing: \\n\\nOld  Tom  Bombadil  is  a  merry  fellow, \\n\\nBright  blue  his  jacket  is,  and  his  boots  are  yellow. \\n\\nNone  has  ever  caught  him  yet,  for  Tom,  he  is  the  master: \\n\\nHis  songs  are  stronger  songs,  and  his  feet  are  faster. \\n\\nThere  was  a  loud  rumbling  sound,  as  of  stones  rolling  and \\nfalling,  and  suddenly  light  streamed  in,  real  light,  the  plain \\nlight  of  day.  A  low  door-like  opening  appeared  at  the  end  of \\n\\n\\ni86 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nthe  chamber  beyond  Frodo’s  feet;  and  there  was  Tom’s  head \\n(hat,  feather,  and  all)  framed  against  the  light  of  the  sun \\nrising  red  behind  him.  The  light  fell  upon  the  floor,  and  upon \\nthe  faces  of  the  three  hobbits  lying  beside  Frodo.  They  did \\nnot  stir,  but  the  sickly  hue  had  left  them.  They  looked  now \\nas  if  they  were  only  very  deeply  asleep. \\n\\nTom  stooped,  removed  his  hat,  and  came  into  the  dark \\nchamber,  singing: \\n\\nGet  out,  you  old  Wight!  Vanish  in  the  sunlight! \\n\\nShrivel  like  the  cold  mist,  like  the  winds  go  wailing, \\n\\nOut  into  the  barren  lands  far  beyond  the  mountains! \\n\\nCome  never  here  again!  Leave  your  barrow  empty! \\n\\nLost  and  forgotten  be,  darker  than  the  darkness, \\n\\nWhere  gates  stand  for  ever  shut,  till  the  world  is  mended. \\n\\nAt  these  words  there  was  a  cry  and  part  of  the  inner  end \\nof  the  chamber  fell  in  with  a  crash.  Then  there  was  a  long \\ntrailing  shriek,  fading  away  into  an  unguessable  distance;  and \\nafter  that  silence. \\n\\n‘Come,  friend  Frodo!’  said  Tom.  ‘Let  us  get  out  on  to \\nclean  grass!  You  must  help  me  bear  them.’ \\n\\nTogether  they  carried  out  Merry,  Pippin,  and  Sam.  As \\nFrodo  left  the  barrow  for  the  last  time  he  thought  he  saw  a \\nsevered  hand  wriggling  still,  like  a  wounded  spider,  in  a  heap \\nof  fallen  earth.  Tom  went  back  in  again,  and  there  was  a \\nsound  of  much  thumping  and  stamping.  When  he  came  out \\nhe  was  bearing  in  his  arms  a  great  load  of  treasure:  things  of \\ngold,  silver,  copper,  and  bronze;  many  beads  and  chains  and \\njewelled  ornaments.  He  climbed  the  green  barrow  and  laid \\nthem  all  on  top  in  the  sunshine. \\n\\nThere  he  stood,  with  his  hat  in  his  hand  and  the  wind  in \\nhis  hair,  and  looked  down  upon  the  three  hobbits,  that  had \\nbeen  laid  on  their  backs  upon  the  grass  at  the  west  side  of \\nthe  mound.  Raising  his  right  hand  he  said  in  a  clear  and \\ncommanding  voice: \\n\\n\\nFOG  ON  THE  BARROW-DOWNS \\n\\n\\nI87 \\n\\n\\nWake  now  my  merry  lads!  Wake  and  hear  me  calling! \\n\\nWarm  now  be  heart  and  limb!  The  cold  stone  is  fallen; \\n\\nDark  door  is  standing  wide;  dead  hand  is  broken. \\n\\nNight  under  Night  is  flown,  and  the  Gate  is  open! \\n\\nTo  Frodo’s  great  joy  the  hobbits  stirred,  stretched  their \\narms,  rubbed  their  eyes,  and  then  suddenly  sprang  up.  They \\nlooked  about  in  amazement,  first  at  Frodo,  and  then  at  Tom \\nstanding  large  as  life  on  the  barrow-top  above  them;  and  then \\nat  themselves  in  their  thin  white  rags,  crowned  and  belted \\nwith  pale  gold,  and  jingling  with  trinkets. \\n\\n‘What  in  the  name  of  wonder?’  began  Merry,  feeling  the \\ngolden  circlet  that  had  slipped  over  one  eye.  Then  he \\nstopped,  and  a  shadow  came  over  his  face,  and  he  closed  his \\neyes.  ‘Of  course,  I  remember!’  he  said.  ‘The  men  of  Carn \\nDum  came  on  us  at  night,  and  we  were  worsted.  Ah!  the \\nspear  in  my  heart!’  He  clutched  at  his  breast.  ‘No!  No!’  he \\nsaid,  opening  his  eyes.  ‘What  am  I  saying?  I  have  been  dream¬ \\ning.  Where  did  you  get  to,  Frodo?’ \\n\\n‘I  thought  that  I  was  lost,’  said  Frodo;  ‘but  I  don’t  want \\nto  speak  of  it.  Let  us  think  of  what  we  are  to  do  now!  Let  us \\ngo  on!’ \\n\\n‘Dressed  up  like  this,  sir?’  said  Sam.  Where  are  my \\nclothes?’  He  flung  his  circlet,  belt,  and  rings  on  the  grass,  and \\nlooked  round  helplessly,  as  if  he  expected  to  find  his  cloak, \\njacket,  and  breeches,  and  other  hobbit-garments  lying  some¬ \\nwhere  to  hand. \\n\\n‘You  won’t  find  your  clothes  again,’  said  Tom,  bounding \\ndown  from  the  mound,  and  laughing  as  he  danced  round \\nthem  in  the  sunlight.  One  would  have  thought  that  nothing \\ndangerous  or  dreadful  had  happened;  and  indeed  the  horror \\nfaded  out  of  their  hearts  as  they  looked  at  him,  and  saw  the \\nmerry  glint  in  his  eyes. \\n\\n‘What  do  you  mean?’  asked  Pippin,  looking  at  him,  half \\npuzzled  and  half  amused.  ‘Why  not?’ \\n\\nBut  Tom  shook  his  head,  saying:  ‘You’ve  found  your¬ \\nselves  again,  out  of  the  deep  water.  Clothes  are  but  little  loss, \\n\\n\\ni88 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nif  you  escape  from  drowning.  Be  glad,  my  merry  friends, \\nand  let  the  warm  sunlight  heat  now  heart  and  limb!  Cast  off \\nthese  cold  rags!  Run  naked  on  the  grass,  while  Tom  goes \\na-hunting!’ \\n\\nHe  sprang  away  down  hill,  whistling  and  calling.  Looking \\ndown  after  him  Frodo  saw  him  running  away  southwards \\nalong  the  green  hollow  between  their  hill  and  the  next,  still \\nwhistling  and  crying: \\n\\nHey!  now!  Come  hoy  now!  WJnther  do  you  wander? \\n\\nUp,  down,  near  or  far,  here,  there  or  yonder? \\n\\nSharp-ears,  Wise-nose,  Swish-tail  and  Bumpkin, \\n\\nWhite-socks  my  little  lad,  and  old  Fatty  Lumpkin! \\n\\nSo  he  sang,  running  fast,  tossing  up  his  hat  and  catching \\nit,  until  he  was  hidden  by  a  fold  of  the  ground:  but  for  some \\ntime  his  hey  now!  hoy  now!  came  floating  back  down  the  wind, \\nwhich  had  shifted  round  towards  the  south. \\n\\nThe  air  was  growing  very  warm  again.  The  hobbits  ran \\nabout  for  a  while  on  the  grass,  as  he  told  them.  Then  they \\nlay  basking  in  the  sun  with  the  delight  of  those  that  have  been \\nwafted  suddenly  from  bitter  winter  to  a  friendly  clime,  or  of \\npeople  that,  after  being  long  ill  and  bedridden,  wake  one  day \\nto  find  that  they  are  unexpectedly  well  and  the  day  is  again \\nfull  of  promise. \\n\\nBy  the  time  that  Tom  returned  they  were  feeling  strong \\n(and  hungry).  He  reappeared,  hat  first,  over  the  brow  of  the \\nhill,  and  behind  him  came  in  an  obedient  line  six  ponies: \\ntheir  own  five  and  one  more.  The  last  was  plainly  old  Fatty \\nLumpkin:  he  was  larger,  stronger,  fatter  (and  older)  than \\ntheir  own  ponies.  Merry,  to  whom  the  others  belonged,  had \\nnot,  in  fact,  given  them  any  such  names,  but  they  answered \\nto  the  new  names  that  Tom  had  given  them  for  the  rest  of \\ntheir  lives.  Tom  called  them  one  by  one  and  they  climbed \\nover  the  brow  and  stood  in  a  line.  Then  Tom  bowed  to  the \\nhobbits. \\n\\n\\nFOG  ON  THE  BARROW-DOWNS  189 \\n\\n‘Here  are  your  ponies,  now!’  he  said.  ‘They’ve  more  sense \\n(in  some  ways)  than  you  wandering  hobbits  have  -  more \\nsense  in  their  noses.  For  they  sniff  danger  ahead  which  you \\nwalk  right  into;  and  if  they  run  to  save  themselves,  then  they \\nrun  the  right  way.  You  must  forgive  them  all;  for  though  their \\nhearts  are  faithful,  to  face  fear  of  Barrow-wights  is  not  what \\nthey  were  made  for.  See,  here  they  come  again,  bringing  all \\ntheir  burdens!’ \\n\\nMerry,  Sam,  and  Pippin  now  clothed  themselves  in  spare \\ngarments  from  their  packs;  and  they  soon  felt  too  hot,  for \\nthey  were  obliged  to  put  on  some  of  the  thicker  and  warmer \\nthings  that  they  had  brought  against  the  oncoming  of  winter. \\n\\n‘Where  does  that  other  old  animal,  that  Fatty  Lumpkin, \\ncome  from?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘He’s  mine,’  said  Tom.  ‘My  four-legged  friend;  though  I \\nseldom  ride  him,  and  he  wanders  often  far,  free  upon  the \\nhillsides.  When  your  ponies  stayed  with  me,  they  got  to  know \\nmy  Lumpkin;  and  they  smelt  him  in  the  night,  and  quickly \\nran  to  meet  him.  I  thought  he’d  look  for  them  and  with  his \\nwords  of  wisdom  take  all  their  fear  away.  But  now,  my  jolly \\nLumpkin,  old  Tom’s  going  to  ride.  Hey!  he’s  coming  with \\nyou,  just  to  set  you  on  the  road;  so  he  needs  a  pony.  For  you \\ncannot  easily  talk  to  hobbits  that  are  riding,  when  you’re  on \\nyour  own  legs  trying  to  trot  beside  them.’ \\n\\nThe  hobbits  were  delighted  to  hear  this,  and  thanked  Tom \\nmany  times;  but  he  laughed,  and  said  that  they  were  so  good \\nat  losing  themselves  that  he  would  not  feel  happy  till  he  had \\nseen  them  safe  over  the  borders  of  his  land.  ‘I’ve  got  things \\nto  do,’  he  said:  ‘my  making  and  my  singing,  my  talking  and \\nmy  walking,  and  my  watching  of  the  country.  Tom  can’t  be \\nalways  near  to  open  doors  and  willow-cracks.  Tom  has  his \\nhouse  to  mind,  and  Goldberry  is  waiting.’ \\n\\nIt  was  still  fairly  early  by  the  sun,  something  between  nine \\nand  ten,  and  the  hobbits  turned  their  minds  to  food.  Their \\nlast  meal  had  been  lunch  beside  the  standing  stone  the  day \\nbefore.  They  breakfasted  now  off  the  remainder  of  Tom’s \\n\\n\\n190  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nprovisions,  meant  for  their  supper,  with  additions  that  Tom \\nhad  brought  with  him.  It  was  not  a  large  meal  (considering \\nhobbits  and  the  circumstances),  but  they  felt  much  better  for \\nit.  While  they  were  eating  Tom  went  up  to  the  mound,  and \\nlooked  through  the  treasures.  Most  of  these  he  made  into  a \\npile  that  glistered  and  sparkled  on  the  grass.  He  bade  them \\nlie  there  ‘free  to  all  finders,  birds,  beasts,  Elves  or  Men,  and \\nall  kindly  creatures’;  for  so  the  spell  of  the  mound  should  be \\nbroken  and  scattered  and  no  Wight  ever  come  back  to  it.  He \\nchose  for  himself  from  the  pile  a  brooch  set  with  blue  stones, \\nmany-shaded  like  flax-flowers  or  the  wings  of  blue  butterflies. \\nHe  looked  long  at  it,  as  if  stirred  by  some  memory,  shaking \\nhis  head,  and  saying  at  last: \\n\\n‘Here  is  a  pretty  toy  for  Tom  and  for  his  lady!  Fair  was \\nshe  who  long  ago  wore  this  on  her  shoulder.  Goldberry  shall \\nwear  it  now,  and  we  will  not  forget  her!’ \\n\\nFor  each  of  the  hobbits  he  chose  a  dagger,  long,  leaf¬ \\nshaped,  and  keen,  of  marvellous  workmanship,  damasked \\nwith  serpent-forms  in  red  and  gold.  They  gleamed  as  he \\ndrew  them  from  their  black  sheaths,  wrought  of  some  strange \\nmetal,  light  and  strong,  and  set  with  many  fiery  stones. \\nWhether  by  some  virtue  in  these  sheaths  or  because  of  the \\nspell  that  lay  on  the  mound,  the  blades  seemed  untouched \\nby  time,  unrusted,  sharp,  glittering  in  the  sun. \\n\\n‘Old  knives  are  long  enough  as  swords  for  hobbit-people,’ \\nhe  said.  ‘Sharp  blades  are  good  to  have,  if  Shire -folk  go \\nwalking,  east,  south,  or  far  away  into  dark  and  danger.’  Then \\nhe  told  them  that  these  blades  were  forged  many  long  years \\nago  by  Men  of  Westernesse:  they  were  foes  of  the  Dark  Lord, \\nbut  they  were  overcome  by  the  evil  king  of  Carn  Dum  in  the \\nLand  of  Angmar. \\n\\n‘Few  now  remember  them,’  Tom  murmured,  ‘yet  still \\nsome  go  wandering,  sons  of  forgotten  kings  walking  in  lone¬ \\nliness,  guarding  from  evil  things  folk  that  are  heedless.’ \\n\\nThe  hobbits  did  not  understand  his  words,  but  as  he  spoke \\nthey  had  a  vision  as  it  were  of  a  great  expanse  of  years  behind \\nthem,  like  a  vast  shadowy  plain  over  which  there  strode \\n\\n\\nFOG  ON  THE  BARROW-DOWNS  191 \\n\\nshapes  of  Men,  tall  and  grim  with  bright  swords,  and  last \\ncame  one  with  a  star  on  his  brow.  Then  the  vision  faded,  and \\nthey  were  back  in  the  sunlit  world.  It  was  time  to  start  again. \\nThey  made  ready,  packing  their  bags  and  lading  their  ponies. \\nTheir  new  weapons  they  hung  on  their  leather  belts  under \\ntheir  jackets,  feeling  them  very  awkward,  and  wondering  if \\nthey  would  be  of  any  use.  Fighting  had  not  before  occurred \\nto  any  of  them  as  one  of  the  adventures  in  which  their  flight \\nwould  land  them. \\n\\nAt  last  they  set  off.  They  led  their  ponies  down  the  hill; \\nand  then  mounting  they  trotted  quickly  along  the  valley.  They \\nlooked  back  and  saw  the  top  of  the  old  mound  on  the  hill, \\nand  from  it  the  sunlight  on  the  gold  went  up  like  a  yellow \\nflame.  Then  they  turned  a  shoulder  of  the  Downs  and  it  was \\nhidden  from  view. \\n\\nThough  Frodo  looked  about  him  on  every  side  he  saw  no \\nsign  of  the  great  stones  standing  like  a  gate,  and  before  long \\nthey  came  to  the  northern  gap  and  rode  swiftly  through,  and \\nthe  land  fell  away  before  them.  It  was  a  merry  journey  with \\nTom  Bombadil  trotting  gaily  beside  them,  or  before  them, \\non  Fatty  Lumpkin,  who  could  move  much  faster  than  his \\ngirth  promised.  Tom  sang  most  of  the  time,  but  it  was  chiefly \\nnonsense,  or  else  perhaps  a  strange  language  unknown  to  the \\nhobbits,  an  ancient  language  whose  words  were  mainly  those \\nof  wonder  and  delight. \\n\\nThey  went  forward  steadily,  but  they  soon  saw  that  the \\nRoad  was  further  away  than  they  had  imagined.  Even  without \\na  fog,  their  sleep  at  mid-day  would  have  prevented  them  from \\nreaching  it  until  after  nightfall  on  the  day  before.  The  dark \\nline  they  had  seen  was  not  a  line  of  trees  but  a  line  of  bushes \\ngrowing  on  the  edge  of  a  deep  dike  with  a  steep  wall  on  the \\nfurther  side.  Tom  said  that  it  had  once  been  the  boundary  of \\na  kingdom,  but  a  very  long  time  ago.  He  seemed  to  remember \\nsomething  sad  about  it,  and  would  not  say  much. \\n\\nThey  climbed  down  and  out  of  the  dike  and  through  a  gap \\nin  the  wall,  and  then  Tom  turned  due  north,  for  they  had \\n\\n\\n192  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nbeen  bearing  somewhat  to  the  west.  The  land  was  now  open \\nand  fairly  level,  and  they  quickened  their  pace,  but  the  sun \\nwas  already  sinking  low  when  at  last  they  saw  a  line  of  tall \\ntrees  ahead,  and  they  knew  that  they  had  come  back  to  the \\nRoad  after  many  unexpected  adventures.  They  galloped  their \\nponies  over  the  last  furlongs,  and  halted  under  the  long \\nshadows  of  the  trees.  They  were  on  the  top  of  a  sloping  bank, \\nand  the  Road,  now  dim  as  evening  drew  on,  wound  away \\nbelow  them.  At  this  point  it  ran  nearly  from  South-west  to \\nNorth-east,  and  on  their  right  it  fell  quickly  down  into  a  wide \\nhollow.  It  was  rutted  and  bore  many  signs  of  the  recent  heavy \\nrain;  there  were  pools  and  pot-holes  full  of  water. \\n\\nThey  rode  down  the  bank  and  looked  up  and  down.  There \\nwas  nothing  to  be  seen.  ‘Well,  here  we  are  again  at  last!’  said \\nFrodo.  ‘I  suppose  we  haven’t  lost  more  than  two  days  by  my \\nshort  cut  through  the  Forest!  But  perhaps  the  delay  will  prove \\nuseful  -  it  may  have  put  them  off  our  trail.’ \\n\\nThe  others  looked  at  him.  The  shadow  of  the  fear  of  the \\nBlack  Riders  came  suddenly  over  them  again.  Ever  since  they \\nhad  entered  the  Forest  they  had  thought  chiefly  of  getting \\nback  to  the  Road;  only  now  when  it  lay  beneath  their  feet  did \\nthey  remember  the  danger  which  pursued  them,  and  was \\nmore  than  likely  to  be  lying  in  wait  for  them  upon  the  Road \\nitself.  They  looked  anxiously  back  towards  the  setting  sun, \\nbut  the  Road  was  brown  and  empty. \\n\\n‘Do  you  think,’  asked  Pippin  hesitatingly,  ‘do  you  think  we \\nmay  be  pursued,  tonight?’ \\n\\n‘No,  I  hope  not  tonight,’  answered  Tom  Bombadil;  ‘nor \\nperhaps  the  next  day.  But  do  not  trust  my  guess;  for  I  cannot \\ntell  for  certain.  Out  east  my  knowledge  fails.  Tom  is  not \\nmaster  of  Riders  from  the  Black  Land  far  beyond  his \\ncountry.’ \\n\\nAll  the  same  the  hobbits  wished  he  was  coming  with  them. \\nThey  felt  that  he  would  know  how  to  deal  with  Black  Riders, \\nif  anyone  did.  They  would  soon  now  be  going  forward  into \\nlands  wholly  strange  to  them,  and  beyond  all  but  the  most \\nvague  and  distant  legends  of  the  Shire,  and  in  the  gathering \\n\\n\\nFOG  ON  THE  BARROW-DOWNS \\n\\n\\n193 \\n\\n\\ntwilight  they  longed  for  home.  A  deep  loneliness  and  sense \\nof  loss  was  on  them.  They  stood  silent,  reluctant  to  make  the \\nfinal  parting,  and  only  slowly  became  aware  that  Tom  was \\nwishing  them  farewell,  and  telling  them  to  have  good  heart \\nand  to  ride  on  till  dark  without  halting. \\n\\n‘Tom  will  give  you  good  advice,  till  this  day  is  over  (after \\nthat  your  own  luck  must  go  with  you  and  guide  you) :  four \\nmiles  along  the  Road  you’ll  come  upon  a  village,  Bree  under \\nBree-hill,  with  doors  looking  westward.  There  you’ll  find  an \\nold  inn  that  is  called  The  Prancing  Pony.  Barliman  Butterbur \\nis  the  worthy  keeper.  There  you  can  stay  the  night,  and \\nafterwards  the  morning  will  speed  you  upon  your  way.  Be \\nbold,  but  wary!  Keep  up  your  merry  hearts,  and  ride  to  meet \\nyour  fortune!’ \\n\\nThey  begged  him  to  come  at  least  as  far  as  the  inn  and \\ndrink  once  more  with  them;  but  he  laughed  and  refused, \\nsaying: \\n\\nTom’s  country  ends  here:  he  will  not  pass  the  borders. \\n\\nTom  has  his  house  to  mind,  and  Goldberry  is  waiting! \\n\\nThen  he  turned,  tossed  up  his  hat,  leaped  on  Lumpkin’s \\nback,  and  rode  up  over  the  bank  and  away  singing  into  the \\ndusk. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  climbed  up  and  watched  him  until  he  was  out \\nof  sight. \\n\\n‘I  am  sorry  to  take  leave  of  Master  Bombadil,’  said  Sam. \\n‘He’s  a  caution  and  no  mistake.  I  reckon  we  may  go  a  good \\ndeal  further  and  see  naught  better,  nor  queerer.  But  I  won’t \\ndeny  I’ll  be  glad  to  see  this  Prancing  Pony  he  spoke  of.  I  hope \\nit’ll  be  like  The  Green  Dragon  away  back  home!  What  sort  of \\nfolic  are  they  in  Bree?’ \\n\\n‘There  are  hobbits  in  Bree,’  said  Merry,  ‘as  well  as  Big \\nFolk.  I  daresay  it  will  be  homelike  enough.  The  Pony  is  a  good \\ninn  by  all  accounts.  My  people  ride  out  there  now  and  again.’ \\n\\n‘It  may  be  all  we  could  wish,’  said  Frodo;  ‘but  it  is  outside \\nthe  Shire  all  the  same.  Don’t  make  yourselves  too  much  at \\n\\n\\n194 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nhome!  Please  remember  -  all  of  you  -  that  the  name  of \\nBaggins  must  NOT  be  mentioned.  I  am  Mr.  Underhill,  if  any \\nname  must  be  given.’ \\n\\nThey  now  mounted  their  ponies  and  rode  off  silently  into \\nthe  evening.  Darkness  came  down  quickly,  as  they  plodded \\nslowly  downhill  and  up  again,  until  at  last  they  saw  lights \\ntwinkling  some  distance  ahead. \\n\\nBefore  them  rose  Bree-hill  barring  the  way,  a  dark  mass \\nagainst  misty  stars;  and  under  its  western  flank  nestled  a  large \\nvillage.  Towards  it  they  now  hurried  desiring  only  to  find  a \\nfire,  and  a  door  between  them  and  the  night. \\n\\n\\nChapter  9 \\n\\n\\nAT  THE  SIGN  OF  THE  PRANCING  PONY \\n\\n\\nBree  was  the  chief  village  of  the  Bree-land,  a  small  inhabited \\nregion,  like  an  island  in  the  empty  lands  round  about.  Besides \\nBree  itself,  there  was  Staddle  on  the  other  side  of  the  hill, \\nCombe  in  a  deep  valley  a  little  further  eastward,  and  Archet \\non  the  edge  of  the  Chetwood.  Lying  round  Bree-hill  and  the \\nvillages  was  a  small  country  of  fields  and  tamed  woodland \\nonly  a  few  miles  broad. \\n\\nThe  Men  of  Bree  were  brown-haired,  broad,  and  rather \\nshort,  cheerful  and  independent:  they  belonged  to  nobody \\nbut  themselves;  but  they  were  more  friendly  and  familiar  with \\nHobbits,  Dwarves,  Elves,  and  other  inhabitants  of  the  world \\nabout  them  than  was  (or  is)  usual  with  Big  People.  According \\nto  their  own  tales  they  were  the  original  inhabitants  and  were \\nthe  descendants  of  the  first  Men  that  ever  wandered  into  the \\nWest  of  the  middle-world.  Few  had  survived  the  turmoils  of \\nthe  Elder  Days;  but  when  the  Kings  returned  again  over  the \\nGreat  Sea  they  had  found  the  Bree-men  still  there,  and  they \\nwere  still  there  now,  when  the  memory  of  the  old  Kings  had \\nfaded  into  the  grass. \\n\\nIn  those  days  no  other  Men  had  settled  dwellings  so  far \\nwest,  or  within  a  hundred  leagues  of  the  Shire.  But  in  the \\nwild  lands  beyond  Bree  there  were  mysterious  wanderers. \\nThe  Bree-folk  called  them  Rangers,  and  knew  nothing  of \\ntheir  origin.  They  were  taller  and  darker  than  the  Men  of \\nBree  and  were  believed  to  have  strange  powers  of  sight \\nand  hearing,  and  to  understand  the  languages  of  beasts \\nand  birds.  They  roamed  at  will  southwards,  and  eastwards \\neven  as  far  as  the  Misty  Mountains;  but  they  were  now \\nfew  and  rarely  seen.  When  they  appeared  they  brought \\nnews  from  afar,  and  told  strange  forgotten  tales  which  were \\n\\n\\n196  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\neagerly  listened  to;  but  the  Bree-folk  did  not  make  friends \\nof  them. \\n\\nThere  were  also  many  families  of  hobbits  in  the  Bree-land; \\nand  they  claimed  to  be  the  oldest  settlement  of  Hobbits  in  the \\nworld,  one  that  was  founded  long  before  even  the  Brandy¬ \\nwine  was  crossed  and  the  Shire  colonized.  They  lived  mostly \\nin  Staddle  though  there  were  some  in  Bree  itself,  especially \\non  the  higher  slopes  of  the  hill,  above  the  houses  of  the  Men. \\nThe  Big  Folk  and  the  Little  Folk  (as  they  called  one  another) \\nwere  on  friendly  terms,  minding  their  own  affairs  in  their \\nown  ways,  but  both  rightly  regarding  themselves  as  necessary \\nparts  of  the  Bree-folk.  Nowhere  else  in  the  world  was  this \\npeculiar  (but  excellent)  arrangement  to  be  found. \\n\\nThe  Bree-folk,  Big  and  Little,  did  not  themselves  travel \\nmuch;  and  the  affairs  of  the  four  villages  were  their  chief \\nconcern.  Occasionally  the  Hobbits  of  Bree  went  as  far  as \\nBuckland,  or  the  Eastfarthing;  but  though  their  little  land  was \\nnot  much  further  than  a  day’s  riding  east  of  the  Brandywine \\nBridge,  the  Hobbits  of  the  Shire  now  seldom  visited  it.  An \\noccasional  Bucklander  or  adventurous  Took  would  come  out \\nto  the  Inn  for  a  night  or  two,  but  even  that  was  becoming \\nless  and  less  usual.  The  Shire -hobbits  referred  to  those  of \\nBree,  and  to  any  others  that  lived  beyond  the  borders,  as \\nOutsiders,  and  took  very  little  interest  in  them,  considering \\nthem  dull  and  uncouth.  There  were  probably  many  more \\nOutsiders  scattered  about  in  the  West  of  the  World  in  those \\ndays  than  the  people  of  the  Shire  imagined.  Some,  doubtless, \\nwere  no  better  than  tramps,  ready  to  dig  a  hole  in  any  bank \\nand  stay  only  as  long  as  it  suited  them.  But  in  the  Bree-land, \\nat  any  rate,  the  hobbits  were  decent  and  prosperous,  and  no \\nmore  rustic  than  most  of  their  distant  relatives  Inside.  It  was \\nnot  yet  forgotten  that  there  had  been  a  time  when  there  was \\nmuch  coming  and  going  between  the  Shire  and  Bree.  There \\nwas  Bree-blood  in  the  Brandybucks  by  all  accounts. \\n\\nThe  village  of  Bree  had  some  hundred  stone  houses  of  the \\nBig  Folic,  mostly  above  the  Road,  nestling  on  the  hillside  with \\n\\n\\nAT  THE  SIGN  OF  THE  PRANCING  PONY  197 \\n\\nwindows  looking  west.  On  that  side,  running  in  more  than \\nhalf  a  circle  from  the  hill  and  back  to  it,  there  was  a  deep  dike \\nwith  a  thick  hedge  on  the  inner  side.  Over  this  the  Road \\ncrossed  by  a  causeway;  but  where  it  pierced  the  hedge  it  was \\nbarred  by  a  great  gate.  There  was  another  gate  in  the  southern \\ncorner  where  the  Road  ran  out  of  the  village.  The  gates  were \\nclosed  at  nightfall;  but  just  inside  them  were  small  lodges  for \\nthe  gatekeepers. \\n\\nDown  on  the  Road,  where  it  swept  to  the  right  to  go  round \\nthe  foot  of  the  hill,  there  was  a  large  inn.  It  had  been  built \\nlong  ago  when  the  traffic  on  the  roads  had  been  far  greater. \\nFor  Bree  stood  at  an  old  meeting  of  ways;  another  ancient \\nroad  crossed  the  East  Road  just  outside  the  dike  at  the  western \\nend  of  the  village,  and  in  former  days  Men  and  other  folic \\nof  various  sorts  had  travelled  much  on  it.  Strange  as  News \\nfrom  Bree  was  still  a  saying  in  the  Eastfarthing,  descending \\nfrom  those  days,  when  news  from  North,  South,  and  East \\ncould  be  heard  in  the  inn,  and  when  the  Shire-hobbits \\nused  to  go  more  often  to  hear  it.  But  the  Northern  Lands \\nhad  long  been  desolate,  and  the  North  Road  was  now  seldom \\nused:  it  was  grass-grown,  and  the  Bree-folk  called  it  the \\nGreenway. \\n\\nThe  Inn  of  Bree  was  still  there,  however,  and  the  innkeeper \\nwas  an  important  person.  His  house  was  a  meeting  place  for \\nthe  idle,  talkative,  and  inquisitive  among  the  inhabitants,  large \\nand  small,  of  the  four  villages;  and  a  resort  of  Rangers  and \\nother  wanderers,  and  for  such  travellers  (mostly  dwarves)  as \\nstill  journeyed  on  the  East  Road,  to  and  from  the  Mountains. \\n\\nIt  was  dark,  and  white  stars  were  shining,  when  Frodo  and \\nhis  companions  came  at  last  to  the  Greenway-crossing  and \\ndrew  near  the  village.  They  came  to  the  West-gate  and  found \\nit  shut;  but  at  the  door  of  the  lodge  beyond  it,  there  was  a \\nman  sitting.  He  jumped  up  and  fetched  a  lantern  and  looked \\nover  the  gate  at  them  in  surprise. \\n\\nWhat  do  you  want,  and  where  do  you  come  from?’  he \\nasked  gruffly. \\n\\n\\n198  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n‘We  are  making  for  the  inn  here,’  answered  Frodo.  We \\nare  journeying  east  and  cannot  go  further  tonight.’ \\n\\n‘Hobbits!  Four  hobbits!  And  what’s  more,  out  of  the  Shire \\nby  their  talk,’  said  the  gatekeeper,  softly  as  if  speaking  to \\nhimself.  He  stared  at  them  darkly  for  a  moment,  and  then \\nslowly  opened  the  gate  and  let  them  ride  through. \\n\\nWe  don’t  often  see  Shire-folk  riding  on  the  Road  at  night,’ \\nhe  went  on,  as  they  halted  a  moment  by  his  door.  ‘You’ll \\npardon  my  wondering  what  business  takes  you  away  east  of \\nBree!  What  may  your  names  be,  might  I  ask?’ \\n\\n‘Our  names  and  our  business  are  our  own,  and  this  does \\nnot  seem  a  good  place  to  discuss  them,’  said  Frodo,  not  liking \\nthe  look  of  the  man  or  the  tone  of  his  voice. \\n\\n‘Your  business  is  your  own,  no  doubt,’  said  the  man;  ‘but \\nit’s  my  business  to  ask  questions  after  nightfall.’ \\n\\nWe  are  hobbits  from  Buckland,  and  we  have  a  fancy  to \\ntravel  and  to  stay  at  the  inn  here,’  put  in  Merry.  ‘I  am  Mr. \\nBrandybuck.  Is  that  enough  for  you?  The  Bree-folk  used  to \\nbe  fair-spoken  to  travellers,  or  so  I  had  heard.’ \\n\\n‘All  right,  all  right!’  said  the  man.  ‘I  meant  no  offence.  But \\nyou’ll  find  maybe  that  more  folk  than  old  Harry  at  the  gate \\nwill  be  asking  you  questions.  There’s  queer  folk  about.  If  you \\ngo  on  to  The  Pony ,  you’ll  find  you’re  not  the  only  guests.’ \\n\\nHe  wished  them  good  night,  and  they  said  no  more;  but \\nFrodo  could  see  in  the  lantern-light  that  the  man  was  still \\neyeing  them  curiously.  He  was  glad  to  hear  the  gate  clang  to \\nbehind  them,  as  they  rode  forward.  He  wondered  why  the \\nman  was  so  suspicious,  and  whether  anyone  had  been  asking \\nfor  news  of  a  party  of  hobbits.  Could  it  have  been  Gandalf? \\nHe  might  have  arrived,  while  they  were  delayed  in  the  Forest \\nand  the  Downs.  But  there  was  something  in  the  look  and  the \\nvoice  of  the  gatekeeper  that  made  him  uneasy. \\n\\nThe  man  stared  after  the  hobbits  for  a  moment,  and  then \\nhe  went  back  to  his  house.  As  soon  as  his  back  was  turned,  a \\ndark  figure  climbed  quickly  in  over  the  gate  and  melted  into \\nthe  shadows  of  the  village  street. \\n\\n\\nAT  THE  SIGN  OF  THE  PRANCING  PONY  199 \\n\\nThe  hobbits  rode  on  up  a  gentle  slope,  passing  a  few \\ndetached  houses,  and  drew  up  outside  the  inn.  The  houses \\nlooked  large  and  strange  to  them.  Sam  stared  up  at  the  inn  with \\nits  three  storeys  and  many  windows,  and  felt  his  heart  sink. \\nHe  had  imagined  himself  meeting  giants  taller  than  trees,  and \\nother  creatures  even  more  terrifying,  some  time  or  other  in  the \\ncourse  of  his  journey;  but  at  the  moment  he  was  finding  his \\nfirst  sight  of  Men  and  their  tall  houses  quite  enough,  indeed \\ntoo  much  for  the  dark  end  of  a  tiring  day.  He  pictured  black \\nhorses  standing  all  saddled  in  the  shadows  of  the  inn-yard, \\nand  Black  Riders  peering  out  of  dark  upper  windows. \\n\\n‘We  surely  aren’t  going  to  stay  here  for  the  night,  are  we, \\nsir?’  he  exclaimed.  ‘If  there  are  hobbit-folk  in  these  parts, \\nwhy  don’t  we  look  for  some  that  would  be  willing  to  take  us \\nin?  It  would  be  more  homelike.’ \\n\\n‘What’s  wrong  with  the  inn?’  said  Frodo.  ‘Tom  Bombadil \\nrecommended  it.  I  expect  it’s  homelike  enough  inside.’ \\n\\nEven  from  the  outside  the  inn  looked  a  pleasant  house  to \\nfamiliar  eyes.  It  had  a  front  on  the  Road,  and  two  wings \\nrunning  back  on  land  partly  cut  out  of  the  lower  slopes  of \\nthe  hill,  so  that  at  the  rear  the  second-floor  windows  were \\nlevel  with  the  ground.  There  was  a  wide  arch  leading  to  a \\ncourtyard  between  the  two  wings,  and  on  the  left  under  the \\narch  there  was  a  large  doorway  reached  by  a  few  broad  steps. \\nThe  door  was  open  and  light  streamed  out  of  it.  Above  the \\narch  there  was  a  lamp,  and  beneath  it  swung  a  large  sign¬ \\nboard:  a  fat  white  pony  reared  up  on  its  hind  legs.  Over  the \\ndoor  was  painted  in  white  letters:  the  prancing  pony  by \\nbarliman  butterbur.  Many  of  the  lower  windows  showed \\nlights  behind  thick  curtains. \\n\\nAs  they  hesitated  outside  in  the  gloom,  someone  began \\nsinging  a  merry  song  inside,  and  many  cheerful  voices  joined \\nloudly  in  the  chorus.  They  listened  to  this  encouraging  sound \\nfor  a  moment  and  then  got  off  their  ponies.  The  song  ended \\nand  there  was  a  burst  of  laughter  and  clapping. \\n\\nThey  led  their  ponies  under  the  arch,  and  leaving  them \\nstanding  in  the  yard  they  climbed  up  the  steps.  Frodo  went \\n\\n\\n200 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nforward  and  nearly  bumped  into  a  short  fat  man  with  a  bald \\nhead  and  a  red  face.  He  had  a  white  apron  on,  and  was \\nbustling  out  of  one  door  and  in  through  another,  carrying  a \\ntray  laden  with  full  mugs. \\n\\n‘Can  we - ’  began  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Half  a  minute,  if  you  please!’  shouted  the  man  over  his \\nshoulder,  and  vanished  into  a  babel  of  voices  and  a  cloud  of \\nsmoke.  In  a  moment  he  was  out  again,  wiping  his  hands  on \\nhis  apron. \\n\\n‘Good  evening,  little  master!’  he  said,  bending  down.  ‘What \\nmay  you  be  wanting?’ \\n\\n‘Beds  for  four,  and  stabling  for  five  ponies,  if  that  can  be \\nmanaged.  Are  you  Mr.  Butterbur?’ \\n\\n‘That’s  right!  Barliman  is  my  name.  Barliman  Butterbur  at \\nyour  service!  You’re  from  the  Shire,  eh?’  he  said,  and  then \\nsuddenly  he  clapped  his  hand  to  his  forehead,  as  if  trying  to \\nremember  something.  ‘Hobbits!’  he  cried.  ‘Now  what  does \\nthat  remind  me  of?  Might  I  ask  your  names,  sirs?’ \\n\\n‘Mr.  Took  and  Mr.  Brandybuck,’  said  Frodo;  ‘and  this  is \\nSam  Gamgee.  My  name  is  Underhill.’ \\n\\n‘There  now!’  said  Mr.  Butterbur,  snapping  his  fingers.  ‘It’s \\ngone  again!  But  it’ll  come  back,  when  I  have  time  to  think. \\nI’m  run  off  my  feet;  but  I’ll  see  what  I  can  do  for  you.  We \\ndon’t  often  get  a  party  out  of  the  Shire  nowadays,  and  I \\nshould  be  sorry  not  to  make  you  welcome.  But  there  is  such \\na  crowd  already  in  the  house  tonight  as  there  hasn’t  been  for \\nlong  enough.  It  never  rains  but  it  pours,  we  say  in  Bree.’ \\n\\n‘Hi!  Nob!’  he  shouted.  ‘Where  are  you,  you  woolly-footed \\nslowcoach?  Nob!’ \\n\\n‘Coming,  sir!  Coming!’  A  cheery-looking  hobbit  bobbed \\nout  of  a  door,  and  seeing  the  travellers,  stopped  short  and \\nstared  at  them  with  great  interest. \\n\\n‘Where’s  Bob?’  asked  the  landlord.  ‘You  don’t  know?  Well, \\nfind  him!  Double  sharp!  I  haven’t  got  six  legs,  nor  six  eyes \\nneither!  Tell  Bob  there’s  five  ponies  that  have  to  be  stabled. \\nHe  must  find  room  somehow.’  Nob  trotted  off  with  a  grin \\nand  a  wink. \\n\\n\\nAT  THE  SIGN  OF  THE  PRANCING  PONY \\n\\n\\n201 \\n\\n\\n‘Well  now,  what  was  I  going  to  say?’  said  Mr.  Butterbur, \\ntapping  his  forehead.  ‘One  thing  drives  out  another,  so  to \\nspeak.  I’m  that  busy  tonight,  my  head  is  going  round.  There’s \\na  party  that  came  up  the  Greenway  from  down  South  last \\nnight  -  and  that  was  strange  enough  to  begin  with.  Then \\nthere’s  a  travelling  company  of  dwarves  going  West  come  in \\nthis  evening.  And  now  there’s  you.  If  you  weren’t  hobbits,  I \\ndoubt  if  we  could  house  you.  But  we’ve  got  a  room  or  two \\nin  the  north  wing  that  were  made  special  for  hobbits,  when \\nthis  place  was  built.  On  the  ground  floor  as  they  usually \\nprefer;  round  windows  and  all  as  they  like  it.  I  hope  you’ll  be \\ncomfortable.  You’ll  be  wanting  supper,  I  don’t  doubt.  As \\nsoon  as  may  be.  This  way  now!’ \\n\\nHe  led  them  a  short  way  down  a  passage,  and  opened \\na  door.  ‘Here  is  a  nice  little  parlour!’  he  said.  ‘I  hope  it  will \\nsuit.  Excuse  me  now.  I’m  that  busy.  No  time  for  talking.  I \\nmust  be  trotting.  It’s  hard  work  for  two  legs,  but  I  don’t  get \\nthinner.  I’ll  look  in  again  later.  If  you  want  anything,  ring  the \\nhand-bell,  and  Nob  will  come.  If  he  don’t  come,  ring  and \\nshout!’ \\n\\nOff  he  went  at  last,  and  left  them  feeling  rather  breathless. \\nHe  seemed  capable  of  an  endless  stream  of  talk,  however \\nbusy  he  might  be.  They  found  themselves  in  a  small  and  cosy \\nroom.  There  was  a  bit  of  bright  fire  burning  on  the  hearth, \\nand  in  front  of  it  were  some  low  and  comfortable  chairs. \\nThere  was  a  round  table,  already  spread  with  a  white  cloth, \\nand  on  it  was  a  large  hand-bell.  But  Nob,  the  hobbit  servant, \\ncame  bustling  in  long  before  they  thought  of  ringing.  He \\nbrought  candles  and  a  tray  full  of  plates. \\n\\n‘Will  you  be  wanting  anything  to  drink,  masters?’  he  asked. \\n‘And  shall  I  show  you  the  bedrooms,  while  your  supper  is \\ngot  ready?’ \\n\\nThey  were  washed  and  in  the  middle  of  good  deep  mugs \\nof  beer  when  Mr.  Butterbur  and  Nob  came  in  again.  In  a \\ntwinkling  the  table  was  laid.  There  was  hot  soup,  cold  meats, \\na  blackberry  tart,  new  loaves,  slabs  of  butter,  and  half  a  ripe \\ncheese:  good  plain  food,  as  good  as  the  Shire  could  show, \\n\\n\\n202 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nand  homelike  enough  to  dispel  the  last  of  Sam’s  misgivings \\n(already  much  relieved  by  the  excellence  of  the  beer) . \\n\\nThe  landlord  hovered  round  for  a  little,  and  then  prepared \\nto  leave  them.  ‘I  don’t  know  whether  you  would  care  to  join \\nthe  company,  when  you  have  supped,’  he  said,  standing \\nat  the  door.  ‘Perhaps  you  would  rather  go  to  your  beds.  Still \\nthe  company  would  be  very  pleased  to  welcome  you,  if \\nyou  had  a  mind.  We  don’t  get  Outsiders  -  travellers  from \\nthe  Shire,  I  should  say,  begging  your  pardon  -  often;  and  we \\nlike  to  hear  a  bit  of  news,  or  any  story  or  song  you  may \\nhave  in  mind.  But  as  you  please!  Ring  the  bell,  if  you  lack \\nanything!’ \\n\\nSo  refreshed  and  encouraged  did  they  feel  at  the  end  of \\ntheir  supper  (about  three  quarters  of  an  hour’s  steady  going, \\nnot  hindered  by  unnecessary  talk)  that  Frodo,  Pippin,  and \\nSam  decided  to  join  the  company.  Merry  said  it  would  be \\ntoo  stuffy.  ‘I  shall  sit  here  quietly  by  the  fire  for  a  bit,  and \\nperhaps  go  out  later  for  a  sniff  of  the  air.  Mind  your  Ps  and \\nQs,  and  don’t  forget  that  you  are  supposed  to  be  escaping  in \\nsecret,  and  are  still  on  the  high-road  and  not  very  far  from \\nthe  Shire!’ \\n\\n‘All  right!’  said  Pippin.  ‘Mind  yourself!  Don’t  get  lost,  and \\ndon’t  forget  that  it  is  safer  indoors!’ \\n\\nThe  company  was  in  the  big  common-room  of  the  inn. \\nThe  gathering  was  large  and  mixed,  as  Frodo  discovered, \\nwhen  his  eyes  got  used  to  the  light.  This  came  chiefly  from \\na  blazing  log-fire,  for  the  three  lamps  hanging  from  the  beams \\nwere  dim,  and  half  veiled  in  smoke.  Barliman  Butterbur  was \\nstanding  near  the  fire,  talking  to  a  couple  of  dwarves  and  one \\nor  two  strange -looking  men.  On  the  benches  were  various \\nfolic:  men  of  Bree,  a  collection  of  local  hobbits  (sitting \\nchattering  together),  a  few  more  dwarves,  and  other  vague \\nfigures  difficult  to  make  out  away  in  the  shadows  and  corners. \\n\\nAs  soon  as  the  Shire -hobbits  entered,  there  was  a  chorus \\nof  welcome  from  the  Bree-landers.  The  strangers,  especially \\nthose  that  had  come  up  the  Greenway,  stared  at  them \\n\\n\\nAT  THE  SIGN  OF  THE  PRANCING  PONY  203 \\n\\ncuriously.  The  landlord  introduced  the  newcomers  to  the \\nBree-folk,  so  quickly  that,  though  they  caught  many  names, \\nthey  were  seldom  sure  who  the  names  belonged  to.  The  Men \\nof  Bree  seemed  all  to  have  rather  botanical  (and  to  the  Shire- \\nfolk  rather  odd)  names,  like  Rushlight,  Goatleaf,  Heather- \\ntoes,  Appledore,  Thistlewool  and  Ferny  (not  to  mention \\nButterbur).  Some  of  the  hobbits  had  similar  names.  The \\nMugworts,  for  instance,  seemed  numerous.  But  most  of  them \\nhad  natural  names,  such  as  Banks,  Brockhouse,  Longholes, \\nSandheaver,  and  Tunnelly,  many  of  which  were  used  in  the \\nShire.  There  were  several  Underhills  from  Staddle,  and  as \\nthey  could  not  imagine  sharing  a  name  without  being  related, \\nthey  took  Frodo  to  their  hearts  as  a  long-lost  cousin. \\n\\nThe  Bree-hobbits  were,  in  fact,  friendly  and  inquisitive, \\nand  Frodo  soon  found  that  some  explanation  of  what  he  was \\ndoing  would  have  to  be  given.  He  gave  out  that  he  was \\ninterested  in  history  and  geography  (at  which  there  was  much \\nwagging  of  heads,  although  neither  of  these  words  were \\nmuch  used  in  the  Bree-dialect) .  He  said  he  was  thinking  of \\nwriting  a  book  (at  which  there  was  silent  astonishment),  and \\nthat  he  and  his  friends  wanted  to  collect  information  about \\nhobbits  living  outside  the  Shire,  especially  in  the  eastern \\nlands. \\n\\nAt  this  a  chorus  of  voices  broke  out.  If  Frodo  had  really \\nwanted  to  write  a  book,  and  had  had  many  ears,  he  would \\nhave  learned  enough  for  several  chapters  in  a  few  minutes. \\nAnd  if  that  was  not  enough,  he  was  given  a  whole  list  of \\nnames,  beginning  with  ‘Old  Barliman  here’,  to  whom  he \\ncould  go  for  further  information.  But  after  a  time,  as  Frodo \\ndid  not  show  any  sign  of  writing  a  book  on  the  spot,  the \\nhobbits  returned  to  their  questions  about  doings  in  the \\nShire.  Frodo  did  not  prove  very  communicative,  and  he  soon \\nfound  himself  sitting  alone  in  a  corner,  listening  and  looking \\naround. \\n\\nThe  Men  and  Dwarves  were  mostly  talking  of  distant \\nevents  and  telling  news  of  a  kind  that  was  becoming  only  too \\nfamiliar.  There  was  trouble  away  in  the  South,  and  it  seemed \\n\\n\\n204  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nthat  the  Men  who  had  come  up  the  Greenway  were  on  the \\nmove,  looking  for  lands  where  they  could  find  some  peace. \\nThe  Bree-folk  were  sympathetic,  but  plainly  not  very  ready \\nto  take  a  large  number  of  strangers  into  their  little  land.  One \\nof  the  travellers,  a  squint-eyed  ill-favoured  fellow,  was  fore¬ \\ntelling  that  more  and  more  people  would  be  coming  north  in \\nthe  near  future.  ‘If  room  isn’t  found  for  them,  they’ll  find  it \\nfor  themselves.  They’ve  a  right  to  live,  same  as  other  folk,’ \\nhe  said  loudly.  The  local  inhabitants  did  not  look  pleased  at \\nthe  prospect. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  did  not  pay  much  attention  to  all  this,  as  it \\ndid  not  at  the  moment  seem  to  concern  hobbits.  Big  Folk \\ncould  hardly  beg  for  lodgings  in  hobbit-holes.  They  were \\nmore  interested  in  Sam  and  Pippin,  who  were  now  feeling \\nquite  at  home,  and  were  chatting  gaily  about  events  in  the \\nShire.  Pippin  roused  a  good  deal  of  laughter  with  an  account \\nof  the  collapse  of  the  roof  of  the  Town  Hole  in  Michel \\nDelving:  Will  Whitfoot,  the  Mayor,  and  the  fattest  hobbit  in \\nthe  Westfarthing,  had  been  buried  in  chalk,  and  came  out \\nlike  a  floured  dumpling.  But  there  were  several  questions \\nasked  that  made  Frodo  a  little  uneasy.  One  of  the  Bree- \\nlanders,  who  seemed  to  have  been  in  the  Shire  several  times, \\nwanted  to  know  where  the  Underhills  lived  and  who  they \\nwere  related  to. \\n\\nSuddenly  Frodo  noticed  that  a  strange-looking  weather¬ \\nbeaten  man,  sitting  in  the  shadows  near  the  wall,  was  also \\nlistening  intently  to  the  hobbit-talk.  He  had  a  tall  tankard  in \\nfront  of  him,  and  was  smoking  a  long-stemmed  pipe  curiously \\ncarved.  His  legs  were  stretched  out  before  him,  showing  high \\nboots  of  supple  leather  that  fitted  him  well,  but  had  seen \\nmuch  wear  and  were  now  caked  with  mud.  A  travel-stained \\ncloak  of  heavy  dark-green  cloth  was  drawn  close  about  him, \\nand  in  spite  of  the  heat  of  the  room  he  wore  a  hood  that \\novershadowed  his  face;  but  the  gleam  of  his  eyes  could  be \\nseen  as  he  watched  the  hobbits. \\n\\nWho  is  that?’  Frodo  asked,  when  he  got  a  chance  to  whis¬ \\nper  to  Mr.  Butterbur.  ‘I  don’t  think  you  introduced  him?’ \\n\\n\\nAT  THE  SIGN  OF  THE  PRANCING  PONY  205 \\n\\n‘Him?’  said  the  landlord  in  an  answering  whisper,  cocking \\nan  eye  without  turning  his  head.  ‘I  don’t  rightly  know.  He  is \\none  of  the  wandering  folk  -  Rangers  we  call  them.  He  seldom \\ntalks:  not  but  what  he  can  tell  a  rare  tale  when  he  has  the \\nmind.  He  disappears  for  a  month,  or  a  year,  and  then  he \\npops  up  again.  He  was  in  and  out  pretty  often  last  spring; \\nbut  I  haven’t  seen  him  about  lately.  What  his  right  name  is \\nI’ve  never  heard:  but  he’s  known  round  here  as  Strider.  Goes \\nabout  at  a  great  pace  on  his  long  shanks;  though  he  don’t  tell \\nnobody  what  cause  he  has  to  hurry.  But  there’s  no  accounting \\nfor  East  and  West,  as  we  say  in  Bree,  meaning  the  Rangers \\nand  the  Shire-folk,  begging  your  pardon.  Funny  you  should \\nask  about  him.’  But  at  that  moment  Mr.  Butterbur  was  called \\naway  by  a  demand  for  more  ale  and  his  last  remark  remained \\nunexplained. \\n\\nFrodo  found  that  Strider  was  now  looking  at  him,  as  if  he \\nhad  heard  or  guessed  all  that  had  been  said.  Presently,  with \\na  wave  of  his  hand  and  a  nod,  he  invited  Frodo  to  come  over \\nand  sit  by  him.  As  Frodo  drew  near  he  threw  back  his  hood, \\nshowing  a  shaggy  head  of  dark  hair  flecked  with  grey,  and  in \\na  pale  stern  face  a  pair  of  keen  grey  eyes. \\n\\n‘I  am  called  Strider,’  he  said  in  a  low  voice.  ‘I  am  very \\npleased  to  meet  you,  Master  -  Underhill,  if  old  Butterbur  got \\nyour  name  right.’ \\n\\n‘He  did,’  said  Frodo  stiffly.  He  felt  far  from  comfortable \\nunder  the  stare  of  those  keen  eyes. \\n\\nWell,  Master  Underhill,’  said  Strider,  ‘if  I  were  you,  I \\nshould  stop  your  young  friends  from  talking  too  much.  Drink, \\nfire,  and  chance-meeting  are  pleasant  enough,  but,  well  -  this \\nisn’t  the  Shire.  There  are  queer  folk  about.  Though  I  say  it \\nas  shouldn’t,  you  may  think,’  he  added  with  a  wry  smile, \\nseeing  Frodo’s  glance.  ‘And  there  have  been  even  stranger \\ntravellers  through  Bree  lately,’  he  went  on,  watching  Frodo’s \\nface. \\n\\nFrodo  returned  his  gaze  but  said  nothing;  and  Strider  made \\nno  further  sign.  His  attention  seemed  suddenly  to  be  fixed  on \\nPippin.  To  his  alarm  Frodo  became  aware  that  the  ridiculous \\n\\n\\n206 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nyoung  Took,  encouraged  by  his  success  with  the  fat  Mayor  of \\nMichel  Delving,  was  now  actually  giving  a  comic  account  of \\nBilbo’s  farewell  party.  He  was  already  giving  an  imitation \\nof  the  Speech,  and  was  drawing  near  to  the  astonishing \\nDisappearance. \\n\\nFrodo  was  annoyed.  It  was  a  harmless  enough  tale  for  most \\nof  the  local  hobbits,  no  doubt:  just  a  funny  story  about  those \\nfunny  people  away  beyond  the  River;  but  some  (old \\nButterbur,  for  instance)  knew  a  thing  or  two,  and  had  prob¬ \\nably  heard  rumours  long  ago  about  Bilbo’s  vanishing.  It \\nwould  bring  the  name  of  Baggins  to  their  minds,  especially  if \\nthere  had  been  inquiries  in  Bree  after  that  name. \\n\\nFrodo  fidgeted,  wondering  what  to  do.  Pippin  was  evi¬ \\ndently  much  enjoying  the  attention  he  was  getting,  and  had \\nbecome  quite  forgetful  of  their  danger.  Frodo  had  a  sudden \\nfear  that  in  his  present  mood  he  might  even  mention  the \\nRing;  and  that  might  well  be  disastrous. \\n\\n‘You  had  better  do  something  quick!’  whispered  Strider  in \\nhis  ear. \\n\\nFrodo  jumped  up  and  stood  on  a  table,  and  began  to  talk. \\nThe  attention  of  Pippin’s  audience  was  disturbed.  Some  of \\nthe  hobbits  looked  at  Frodo  and  laughed  and  clapped,  think¬ \\ning  that  Mr.  Underhill  had  taken  as  much  ale  as  was  good \\nfor  him. \\n\\nFrodo  suddenly  felt  very  foolish,  and  found  himself  (as \\nwas  his  habit  when  making  a  speech)  fingering  the  things  in \\nhis  pocket.  He  felt  the  Ring  on  its  chain,  and  quite  unac¬ \\ncountably  the  desire  came  over  him  to  slip  it  on  and  vanish \\nout  of  the  silly  situation.  It  seemed  to  him,  somehow,  as  if \\nthe  suggestion  came  to  him  from  outside,  from  someone  or \\nsomething  in  the  room.  He  resisted  the  temptation  firmly, \\nand  clasped  the  Ring  in  his  hand,  as  if  to  keep  a  hold  on  it \\nand  prevent  it  from  escaping  or  doing  any  mischief.  At  any \\nrate  it  gave  him  no  inspiration.  He  spoke  ‘a  few  suitable \\nwords’,  as  they  would  have  said  in  the  Shire:  We  are  all  very \\nmuch  gratified  by  the  kindness  of  your  reception,  and  I  venture \\nto  hope  that  my  brief  visit  will  help  to  renew  the  old  ties  of \\n\\n\\nAT  THE  SIGN  OF  THE  PRANCING  PONY  207 \\n\\nfriendship  between  the  Shire  and  Bree;  and  then  he  hesitated \\nand  coughed. \\n\\nEveryone  in  the  room  was  now  looking  at  him.  ‘A  song!’ \\nshouted  one  of  the  hobbits.  ‘A  song!  A  song!’  shouted  all  the \\nothers.  ‘Come  on  now,  master,  sing  us  something  that  we \\nhaven’t  heard  before!’ \\n\\nFor  a  moment  Frodo  stood  gaping.  Then  in  desperation \\nhe  began  a  ridiculous  song  that  Bilbo  had  been  rather  fond \\nof  (and  indeed  rather  proud  of,  for  he  had  made  up  the  words \\nhimself).  It  was  about  an  inn;  and  that  is  probably  why  it \\ncame  into  Frodo’s  mind  just  then.  Here  it  is  in  full.  Only  a \\nfew  words  of  it  are  now,  as  a  rule,  remembered. \\n\\nThere  is  an  inn,  a  merry  old  inn \\nbeneath  an  old  grey  hill, \\n\\nAnd  there  they  brew  a  beer  so  brown \\nThat  the  Man  in  the  Moon  himself  came  down \\none  night  to  drink  his  fill. \\n\\nThe  ostler  has  a  tipsy  cat \\n\\nthat  plays  a  five-stringed  fiddle; \\n\\nAnd  np  and  down  he  runs  his  bow, \\n\\nNow  squeaking  high,  now  purring  low, \\nnow  sawing  in  the  middle. \\n\\nThe  landlord  keeps  a  little  dog \\nthat  is  mighty  fond  of  jokes; \\n\\nWhen  there’s  good  cheer  among  the  guests, \\n\\nHe  cocks  an  ear  at  all  the  jests \\nand  laughs  until  he  chokes. \\n\\nThey  also  keep  a  horned  cow \\nas  proud  as  any  queen; \\n\\nBut  music  turns  her  head  like  ale, \\n\\nAnd  makes  her  wave  her  tufted  tail \\nand  dance  upon  the  green. \\n\\n\\n208 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nAnd  O!  the  rows  of  silver  dishes \\nand  the  store  of  silver  spoons! \\n\\nFor  Sunday*  there’s  a  special  pair, \\n\\nAnd  these  they  polish  up  with  care \\non  Saturday  afternoons. \\n\\nThe  Man  in  the  Moon  was  drinking  deep, \\nand  the  cat  began  to  wail; \\n\\nA  dish  and  a  spoon  on  the  table  danced, \\n\\nThe  cow  in  the  garden  madly  pranced, \\nand  the  little  dog  chased  his  tail. \\n\\nThe  Man  in  the  Moon  took  another  mug, \\nand  then  rolled  beneath  his  chair; \\n\\nAnd  there  he  dozed  and  dreamed  of  ale, \\n\\nTill  in  the  sky  the  stars  were  pale, \\nand  dawn  was  in  the  air. \\n\\nThen  the  ostler  said  to  his  tipsy  cat: \\n\\n‘ The  white  horses  of  the  Moon, \\n\\nThey  neigh  and  champ  their  silver  bits; \\n\\nBut  their  master’s  been  and  drowned  his  wits, \\nand  the  Sun’ll  be  rising  soon!’ \\n\\nSo  the  cat  on  his  fiddle  played  hey-diddle-diddle, \\na  jig  that  would  wake  the  dead: \\n\\nHe  squeaked  and  sawed  and  quickened  the  tune, \\nWhile  the  landlord  shook  the  Man  in  the  Moon: \\n\\n‘ It’s  after  three!’  he  said. \\n\\nThey  rolled  the  Man  slowly  up  the  hill \\nand  bundled  him  into  the  Moon, \\n\\nWhile  his  horses  galloped  up  in  rear, \\n\\nAnd  the  cow  came  capering  like  a  deer, \\nand  a  dish  ran  up  with  the  spoon. \\n\\n\\n*  See  note  2,  III,  p.  1462 \\n\\n\\nAT  THE  SIGN  OF  THE  PRANCING  PONY  209 \\n\\nNow  quicker  the  fiddle  went  deedle-dum-diddle; \\nthe  dog  began  to  roar, \\n\\nThe  cow  and  the  horses  stood  on  their  heads; \\n\\nThe  guests  all  bounded  from  their  beds \\nand  danced  upon  the  floor. \\n\\nWith  a  ping  and  a  pong  the  fiddle-strings  broke! \\nthe  cow  jumped  over  the  Moon, \\n\\nAnd  the  little  dog  laughed  to  see  such  fun, \\n\\nAnd  the  Saturday  dish  went  off  at  a  run \\nwith  the  silver  Sunday  spoon. \\n\\nThe  round  Moon  rolled  behind  the  hill \\nas  the  Sun  raised  up  her  head. \\n\\nShe*  hardly  believed  her  fiery  eyes; \\n\\nFor  though  it  was  day,  to  her  surprise \\nthey  all  went  back  to  bed! \\n\\nThere  was  loud  and  long  applause.  Frodo  had  a  good \\nvoice,  and  the  song  tickled  their  fancy.  ‘Where’s  old  Barley?’ \\nthey  cried.  ‘He  ought  to  hear  this.  Bob  ought  to  learn  his  cat \\nthe  fiddle,  and  then  we’d  have  a  dance.’  They  called  for  more \\nale,  and  began  to  shout:  ‘Let’s  have  it  again,  master!  Come \\non  now!  Once  more!’ \\n\\nThey  made  Frodo  have  another  drink,  and  then  begin  his \\nsong  again,  while  many  of  them  joined  in;  for  the  tune  was \\nwell  known,  and  they  were  quick  at  picking  up  words.  It  was \\nnow  Frodo’s  turn  to  feel  pleased  with  himself.  He  capered \\nabout  on  the  table;  and  when  he  came  a  second  time  to  the \\ncow  jumped  over  the  Moon ,  he  leaped  in  the  air.  Much  too \\nvigorously;  for  he  came  down,  bang,  into  a  tray  full  of  mugs, \\nand  slipped,  and  rolled  off  the  table  with  a  crash,  clatter, \\nand  bump!  The  audience  all  opened  their  mouths  wide  for \\nlaughter,  and  stopped  short  in  gaping  silence;  for  the  singer \\n\\n\\nElves  (and  Hobbits)  always  refer  to  the  Sun  as  She. \\n\\n\\n210 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\ndisappeared.  He  simply  vanished,  as  if  he  had  gone  slap \\nthrough  the  floor  without  leaving  a  hole! \\n\\nThe  local  hobbits  stared  in  amazement,  and  then  sprang \\nto  their  feet  and  shouted  for  Barliman.  All  the  company  drew \\naway  from  Pippin  and  Sam,  who  found  themselves  left  alone \\nin  a  corner,  and  eyed  darkly  and  doubtfully  from  a  distance. \\nIt  was  plain  that  many  people  regarded  them  now  as  the \\ncompanions  of  a  travelling  magician  of  unknown  powers  and \\npurpose.  But  there  was  one  swarthy  Bree-lander,  who  stood \\nlooking  at  them  with  a  knowing  and  half-mocking  expression \\nthat  made  them  feel  very  uncomfortable.  Presently  he  slipped \\nout  of  the  door,  followed  by  the  squint-eyed  southerner:  the \\ntwo  had  been  whispering  together  a  good  deal  during  the \\nevening. \\n\\nFrodo  felt  a  fool.  Not  knowing  what  else  to  do,  he  crawled \\naway  under  the  tables  to  the  dark  corner  by  Strider,  who  sat \\nunmoved,  giving  no  sign  of  his  thoughts.  Frodo  leaned  back \\nagainst  the  wall  and  took  off  the  Ring.  How  it  came  to  be  on \\nhis  finger  he  could  not  tell.  He  could  only  suppose  that  he \\nhad  been  handling  it  in  his  pocket  while  he  sang,  and  that \\nsomehow  it  had  slipped  on  when  he  stuck  out  his  hand  with \\na  jerk  to  save  his  fall.  For  a  moment  he  wondered  if  the  Ring \\nitself  had  not  played  him  a  trick;  perhaps  it  had  tried  to  reveal \\nitself  in  response  to  some  wish  or  command  that  was  felt  in \\nthe  room.  He  did  not  like  the  looks  of  the  men  that  had  gone \\nout. \\n\\n‘Well?’  said  Strider,  when  he  reappeared.  Why  did  you  do \\nthat?  Worse  than  anything  your  friends  could  have  said!  You \\nhave  put  your  foot  in  it!  Or  should  I  say  your  finger?’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know  what  you  mean,’  said  Frodo,  annoyed  and \\nalarmed. \\n\\n‘Oh  yes,  you  do,’  answered  Strider;  ‘but  we  had  better  wait \\nuntil  the  uproar  has  died  down.  Then,  if  you  please,  Mr. \\nBaggins,  I  should  like  a  quiet  word  with  you.’ \\n\\nWhat  about?’  asked  Frodo,  ignoring  the  sudden  use  of  his \\nproper  name. \\n\\n‘A  matter  of  some  importance  -  to  us  both,’  answered \\n\\n\\nAT  THE  SIGN  OF  THE  PRANCING  PONY \\n\\n\\n21 1 \\n\\n\\nStrider,  looking  Frodo  in  the  eye.  ‘You  may  hear  something \\nto  your  advantage.’ \\n\\n‘Very  well,’  said  Frodo,  trying  to  appear  unconcerned.  ‘I’ll \\ntalk  to  you  later.’ \\n\\nMeanwhile  an  argument  was  going  on  by  the  fireplace.  Mr. \\nButterbur  had  come  trotting  in,  and  he  was  now  trying  to \\nlisten  to  several  conflicting  accounts  of  the  event  at  the  same \\ntime. \\n\\n‘I  saw  him,  Mr.  Butterbur,’  said  a  hobbit;  ‘or  leastways  I \\ndidn’t  see  him,  if  you  take  my  meaning.  He  just  vanished  into \\nthin  air,  in  a  manner  of  speaking.’ \\n\\n‘You  don’t  say,  Mr.  Mugwort!’  said  the  landlord,  looking \\npuzzled. \\n\\n‘Yes  I  do!’  replied  Mugwort.  ‘And  I  mean  what  I  say, \\nwhat’s  more.’ \\n\\n‘There’s  some  mistake  somewhere,’  said  Butterbur,  shak¬ \\ning  his  head.  ‘There  was  too  much  of  that  Mr.  Underhill  to \\ngo  vanishing  into  thin  air;  or  into  thick  air,  as  is  more  likely \\nin  this  room.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  where  is  he  now?’  cried  several  voices. \\n\\n‘How  should  I  know?  He’s  welcome  to  go  where  he  will, \\nso  long  as  he  pays  in  the  morning.  There’s  Mr.  Took,  now: \\nhe’s  not  vanished.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  I  saw  what  I  saw,  and  I  saw  what  I  didn’t,’  said \\nMugwort  obstinately. \\n\\n‘And  I  say  there’s  some  mistake,’  repeated  Butterbur, \\npicking  up  the  tray  and  gathering  up  the  broken  crockery. \\n\\n‘Of  course  there’s  a  mistake!’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  haven’t  van¬ \\nished.  Here  I  am!  I’ve  just  been  having  a  few  words  with \\nStrider  in  the  corner.’ \\n\\nHe  came  forward  into  the  firelight;  but  most  of  the  com¬ \\npany  backed  away,  even  more  perturbed  than  before.  They \\nwere  not  in  the  least  satisfied  by  his  explanation  that  he  had \\ncrawled  away  quickly  under  the  tables  after  he  had  fallen. \\nMost  of  the  Hobbits  and  the  Men  of  Bree  went  off  then  and \\nthere  in  a  huff,  having  no  fancy  for  further  entertainment  that \\n\\n\\n212 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nevening.  One  or  two  gave  Frodo  a  black  look  and  departed \\nmuttering  among  themselves.  The  Dwarves  and  the  two  or \\nthree  strange  Men  that  still  remained  got  up  and  said  good \\nnight  to  the  landlord,  but  not  to  Frodo  and  his  friends.  Before \\nlong  no  one  was  left  but  Strider,  who  sat  on,  unnoticed,  by \\nthe  wall. \\n\\nMr.  Butterbur  did  not  seem  much  put  out.  He  reckoned, \\nvery  probably,  that  his  house  would  be  full  again  on  many \\nfuture  nights,  until  the  present  mystery  had  been  thoroughly \\ndiscussed.  ‘Now  what  have  you  been  doing,  Mr.  Underhill?’ \\nhe  asked.  ‘Frightening  my  customers  and  breaking  up  my \\ncrocks  with  your  acrobatics!’ \\n\\n‘I  am  very  sorry  to  have  caused  any  trouble,’  said  Frodo. \\n‘It  was  quite  unintentional,  I  assure  you.  A  most  unfortunate \\naccident.’ \\n\\n‘All  right,  Mr.  Underhill!  But  if  you’re  going  to  do  any \\nmore  tumbling,  or  conjuring,  or  whatever  it  was,  you’d  best \\nwarn  folk  beforehand  -  and  warn  me.  We’re  a  bit  suspicious \\nround  here  of  anything  out  of  the  way  -  uncanny,  if  you \\nunderstand  me;  and  we  don’t  take  to  it  all  of  a  sudden.’ \\n\\n‘I  shan’t  be  doing  anything  of  the  sort  again,  Mr.  Butterbur, \\nI  promise  you.  And  now  I  think  I’ll  be  getting  to  bed.  We \\nshall  be  making  an  early  start.  Will  you  see  that  our  ponies \\nare  ready  by  eight  o’clock?’ \\n\\n‘Very  good!  But  before  you  go,  I  should  like  a  word  with \\nyou  in  private,  Mr.  Underhill.  Something  has  just  come  back \\nto  my  mind  that  I  ought  to  tell  you.  I  hope  that  you’ll  not \\ntake  it  amiss.  When  I’ve  seen  to  a  thing  or  two,  I’ll  come \\nalong  to  your  room,  if  you’re  willing.’ \\n\\n‘Certainly!’  said  Frodo;  but  his  heart  sank.  He  wondered \\nhow  many  private  talks  he  would  have  before  he  got  to  bed, \\nand  what  they  would  reveal.  Were  these  people  all  in  league \\nagainst  him?  He  began  to  suspect  even  old  Butterbur’s  fat \\nface  of  concealing  dark  designs. \\n\\n\\nChapter  io \\n\\n\\nSTRIDER \\n\\n\\nFrodo,  Pippin,  and  Sam  made  their  way  back  to  the  parlour. \\nThere  was  no  light.  Merry  was  not  there,  and  the  fire  had \\nburned  low.  It  was  not  until  they  had  puffed  up  the  embers \\ninto  a  blaze  and  thrown  on  a  couple  of  faggots  that  they \\ndiscovered  Strider  had  come  with  them.  There  he  was  calmly \\nsitting  in  a  chair  by  the  door! \\n\\n‘Hallo!’  said  Pippin.  ‘Who  are  you,  and  what  do  you  want?’ \\n\\n‘I  am  called  Strider,’  he  answered;  ‘and  though  he  may \\nhave  forgotten  it,  your  friend  promised  to  have  a  quiet  talk \\nwith  me.’ \\n\\n‘You  said  I  might  hear  something  to  my  advantage,  I \\nbelieve,’  said  Frodo.  ‘What  have  you  to  say?’ \\n\\n‘Several  things,’  answered  Strider.  ‘But,  of  course,  I  have \\nmy  price.’ \\n\\nWhat  do  you  mean?’  asked  Frodo  sharply. \\n\\n‘Don’t  be  alarmed!  I  mean  just  this:  I  will  tell  you  what \\nI  know,  and  give  you  some  good  advice  -  but  I  shall  want  a \\nreward.’ \\n\\n‘And  what  will  that  be,  pray?’  said  Frodo.  He  suspected \\nnow  that  he  had  fallen  in  with  a  rascal,  and  he  thought \\nuncomfortably  that  he  had  brought  only  a  little  money  with \\nhim.  All  of  it  would  hardly  satisfy  a  rogue,  and  he  could  not \\nspare  any  of  it. \\n\\n‘No  more  than  you  can  afford,’  answered  Strider  with  a \\nslow  smile,  as  if  he  guessed  Frodo’s  thoughts.  ‘Just  this:  you \\nmust  take  me  along  with  you,  until  I  wish  to  leave  you.’ \\n\\n‘Oh,  indeed!’  replied  Frodo,  surprised,  but  not  much \\nrelieved.  ‘Even  if  I  wanted  another  companion,  I  should  not \\nagree  to  any  such  thing,  until  I  knew  a  good  deal  more  about \\nyou,  and  your  business.’ \\n\\n\\n214 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Excellent!’  exclaimed  Strider,  crossing  his  legs  and  sitting \\nback  comfortably.  ‘You  seem  to  be  coming  to  your  senses \\nagain,  and  that  is  all  to  the  good.  You  have  been  much  too \\ncareless  so  far.  Very  well!  I  will  tell  you  what  I  know,  and \\nleave  the  reward  to  you.  You  may  be  glad  to  grant  it,  when \\nyou  have  heard  me.’ \\n\\n‘Go  on  then!’  said  Frodo.  ‘What  do  you  know?’ \\n\\n‘Too  much;  too  many  dark  things,’  said  Strider  grimly. \\n\\n‘But  as  for  your  business - ’  He  got  up  and  went  to  the \\n\\ndoor,  opened  it  quickly  and  looked  out.  Then  he  shut  it \\nquietly  and  sat  down  again.  ‘I  have  quick  ears,’  he  went  on, \\nlowering  his  voice,  ‘and  though  I  cannot  disappear,  I  have \\nhunted  many  wild  and  wary  things  and  I  can  usually  avoid \\nbeing  seen,  if  I  wish.  Now,  I  was  behind  the  hedge  this \\nevening  on  the  Road  west  of  Bree,  when  four  hobbits  came \\nout  of  the  Downlands.  I  need  not  repeat  all  that  they  said  to \\nold  Bombadil  or  to  one  another;  but  one  thing  interested  me. \\nPlease  remember ,  said  one  of  them,  that  the  name  Baggins  must \\nnot  be  mentioned.  I  am  Mr.  Underhill,  if  any  name  must  be \\ngiven.  That  interested  me  so  much  that  I  followed  them  here. \\nI  slipped  over  the  gate  just  behind  them.  Maybe  Mr.  Baggins \\nhas  an  honest  reason  for  leaving  his  name  behind;  but  if  so, \\nI  should  advise  him  and  his  friends  to  be  more  careful.’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  see  what  interest  my  name  has  for  anyone  in  Bree,’ \\nsaid  Frodo  angrily,  ‘and  I  have  still  to  learn  why  it  interests \\nyou.  Mr.  Strider  may  have  an  honest  reason  for  spying  and \\neavesdropping;  but  if  so,  I  should  advise  him  to  explain  it.  ’ \\n\\n‘Well  answered!’  said  Strider  laughing.  ‘But  the  explanation \\nis  simple:  I  was  looking  for  a  Hobbit  called  Frodo  Baggins.  I \\nwanted  to  find  him  quickly.  I  had  learned  that  he  was  carrying \\nout  of  the  Shire,  well,  a  secret  that  concerned  me  and  my \\nfriends. \\n\\n‘Now,  don’t  mistake  me!’  he  cried,  as  Frodo  rose  from  his \\nseat,  and  Sam  jumped  up  with  a  scowl.  ‘I  shall  take  more \\ncare  of  the  secret  than  you  do.  And  care  is  needed!’  He  leaned \\nforward  and  looked  at  them.  Watch  every  shadow!’  he  said \\nin  a  low  voice.  ‘Black  horsemen  have  passed  through  Bree. \\n\\n\\nSTRIDER \\n\\n\\n215 \\n\\n\\nOn  Monday  one  came  down  the  Greenway,  they  say;  and \\nanother  appeared  later,  coming  up  the  Greenway  from  the \\nsouth.’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  silence.  At  last  Frodo  spoke  to  Pippin  and \\nSam:  ‘I  ought  to  have  guessed  it  from  the  way  the  gatekeeper \\ngreeted  us,’  he  said.  ‘And  the  landlord  seems  to  have  heard \\nsomething.  Why  did  he  press  us  to  join  the  company?  And \\nwhy  on  earth  did  we  behave  so  foolishly:  we  ought  to  have \\nstayed  quiet  in  here.’ \\n\\n‘It  would  have  been  better,’  said  Strider.  ‘I  would  have \\nstopped  your  going  into  the  common-room,  if  I  could;  but \\nthe  innkeeper  would  not  let  me  in  to  see  you,  or  take  a \\nmessage.’ \\n\\n‘Do  you  think  he - ’  began  Frodo. \\n\\n‘No,  I  don’t  think  any  harm  of  old  Butterbur.  Only  he  does \\nnot  altogether  like  mysterious  vagabonds  of  my  sort.’  Frodo \\ngave  him  a  puzzled  look.  ‘Well,  I  have  rather  a  rascally  look, \\nhave  I  not?’  said  Strider  with  a  curl  of  his  lip  and  a  queer \\ngleam  in  his  eye.  ‘But  I  hope  we  shall  get  to  know  one  another \\nbetter.  When  we  do,  I  hope  you  will  explain  what  happened \\nat  the  end  of  your  song.  For  that  little  prank - ’ \\n\\n‘It  was  sheer  accident!’  interrupted  Frodo. \\n\\n‘I  wonder,’  said  Strider.  ‘Accident,  then.  That  accident  has \\nmade  your  position  dangerous.’ \\n\\n‘Hardly  more  than  it  was  already,’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  knew \\nthese  horsemen  were  pursuing  me;  but  now  at  any  rate  they \\nseem  to  have  missed  me  and  to  have  gone  away.’ \\n\\n‘You  must  not  count  on  that!’  said  Strider  sharply.  ‘They \\nwill  return.  And  more  are  coming.  There  are  others.  I  know \\ntheir  number.  I  know  these  Riders.’  He  paused,  and  his  eyes \\nwere  cold  and  hard.  ‘And  there  are  some  folk  in  Bree  who \\nare  not  to  be  trusted,’  he  went  on.  ‘Bill  Ferny,  for  instance. \\nHe  has  an  evil  name  in  the  Bree-land,  and  queer  folk  call  at \\nhis  house.  You  must  have  noticed  him  among  the  company: \\na  swarthy  sneering  fellow.  He  was  very  close  with  one  of  the \\nSouthern  strangers,  and  they  slipped  out  together  just  after \\n\\n\\n216 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nyour  “accident”.  Not  all  of  those  Southerners  mean  well;  and \\nas  for  Ferny,  he  would  sell  anything  to  anybody;  or  make \\nmischief  for  amusement.’ \\n\\n‘What  will  Ferny  sell,  and  what  has  my  accident  got  to  do \\nwith  him?’  said  Frodo,  still  determined  not  to  understand \\nStrider’s  hints. \\n\\n‘News  of  you,  of  course,’  answered  Strider.  ‘An  account \\nof  your  performance  would  be  very  interesting  to  certain \\npeople.  After  that  they  would  hardly  need  to  be  told  your  real \\nname.  It  seems  to  me  only  too  likely  that  they  will  hear  of  it \\nbefore  this  night  is  over.  Is  that  enough?  You  can  do  as  you \\nlike  about  my  reward:  take  me  as  a  guide  or  not.  But  I  may \\nsay  that  I  know  all  the  lands  between  the  Shire  and  the  Misty \\nMountains,  for  I  have  wandered  over  them  for  many  years. \\nI  am  older  than  I  look.  I  might  prove  useful.  You  will  have \\nto  leave  the  open  road  after  tonight;  for  the  horsemen  will \\nwatch  it  night  and  day.  You  may  escape  from  Bree,  and  be \\nallowed  to  go  forward  while  the  Sun  is  up;  but  you  won’t  go \\nfar.  They  will  come  on  you  in  the  wild,  in  some  dark  place \\nwhere  there  is  no  help.  Do  you  wish  them  to  find  you?  They \\nare  terrible!’ \\n\\nThe  hobbits  looked  at  him,  and  saw  with  surprise  that  his \\nface  was  drawn  as  if  with  pain,  and  his  hands  clenched  the \\narms  of  his  chair.  The  room  was  very  quiet  and  still,  and  the \\nlight  seemed  to  have  grown  dim.  For  a  while  he  sat  with \\nunseeing  eyes  as  if  walking  in  distant  memory  or  listening  to \\nsounds  in  the  Night  far  away. \\n\\n‘There!’  he  cried  after  a  moment,  drawing  his  hand  across \\nhis  brow.  ‘Perhaps  I  know  more  about  these  pursuers  than \\nyou  do.  You  fear  them,  but  you  do  not  fear  them  enough, \\nyet.  Tomorrow  you  will  have  to  escape,  if  you  can.  Strider \\ncan  take  you  by  paths  that  are  seldom  trodden.  Will  you  have \\nhim?’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  heavy  silence.  Frodo  made  no  answer;  his \\nmind  was  confused  with  doubt  and  fear.  Sam  frowned,  and \\nlooked  at  his  master;  and  at  last  he  broke  out: \\n\\n‘With  your  leave,  Mr.  Frodo,  I’d  say  no\\\\  This  Strider  here, \\n\\n\\nSTRIDER \\n\\n\\n217 \\n\\n\\nhe  warns  and  he  says  take  care;  and  I  say  yes  to  that,  and  let’s \\nbegin  with  him.  He  comes  out  of  the  Wild,  and  I  never  heard \\nno  good  of  such  folic.  He  knows  something,  that’s  plain,  and \\nmore  than  I  like;  but  it’s  no  reason  why  we  should  let  him \\ngo  leading  us  out  into  some  dark  place  far  from  help,  as  he \\nputs  it.’ \\n\\nPippin  fidgeted  and  looked  uncomfortable.  Strider  did  not \\nreply  to  Sam,  but  turned  his  keen  eyes  on  Frodo.  Frodo \\ncaught  his  glance  and  looked  away.  ‘No,’  he  said  slowly.  ‘I \\ndon’t  agree.  I  think,  I  think  you  are  not  really  as  you  choose \\nto  look.  You  began  to  talk  to  me  like  the  Bree-folk,  but  your \\nvoice  has  changed.  Still  Sam  seems  right  in  this:  I  don’t  see \\nwhy  you  should  warn  us  to  take  care,  and  yet  ask  us  to  take \\nyou  on  trust.  Why  the  disguise?  Who  are  you?  What  do  you \\nreally  know  about  -  about  my  business;  and  how  do  you \\nknow  it?’ \\n\\n‘The  lesson  in  caution  has  been  well  learned,’  said  Strider \\nwith  a  grim  smile.  ‘But  caution  is  one  thing  and  wavering  is \\nanother.  You  will  never  get  to  Rivendell  now  on  your  own, \\nand  to  trust  me  is  your  only  chance.  You  must  make  up  your \\nmind.  I  will  answer  some  of  your  questions,  if  that  will  help \\nyou  to  do  so.  But  why  should  you  believe  my  story,  if  you \\ndo  not  trust  me  already?  Still  here  it  is - ’ \\n\\nAt  that  moment  there  came  a  knock  at  the  door.  Mr. \\nButterbur  had  arrived  with  candles,  and  behind  him  was  Nob \\nwith  cans  of  hot  water.  Strider  withdrew  into  a  dark  corner. \\n\\n‘I’ve  come  to  bid  you  good  night,’  said  the  landlord,  putting \\nthe  candles  on  the  table.  ‘Nob!  Take  the  water  to  the  rooms!’ \\nHe  came  in  and  shut  the  door. \\n\\n‘It’s  like  this,’  he  began,  hesitating  and  looking  troubled.  ‘If \\nI’ve  done  any  harm,  I’m  sorry  indeed.  But  one  thing  drives \\nout  another,  as  you’ll  admit;  and  I’m  a  busy  man.  But  first  one \\nthing  and  then  another  this  week  have  jogged  my  memory,  as \\nthe  saying  goes;  and  not  too  late  I  hope.  You  see,  I  was  asked \\nto  look  out  for  hobbits  of  the  Shire,  and  for  one  by  the  name \\nof  Baggins  in  particular.’ \\n\\n\\n2l8 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘And  what  has  that  got  to  do  with  me?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Ah!  you  know  best,’  said  the  landlord,  knowingly.  ‘I  won’t \\ngive  you  away;  but  I  was  told  that  this  Baggins  would  be \\ngoing  by  the  name  of  Underhill,  and  I  was  given  a  description \\nthat  fits  you  well  enough,  if  I  may  say  so.’ \\n\\n‘Indeed!  Let’s  have  it  then!’  said  Frodo,  unwisely  inter¬ \\nrupting. \\n\\n‘A  stout  little  fellow  with  red  cheeks ,’  said  Mr.  Butterbur \\nsolemnly.  Pippin  chuckled,  but  Sam  looked  indignant.  ‘  That \\nwon’t  help  you  much;  it  goes  for  most  hobbits,  Barley ,  he  says  to \\nme,’  continued  Mr.  Butterbur  with  a  glance  at  Pippin.  ‘But \\nthis  one  is  taller  than  some  and  fairer  than  most,  and  he  has  a \\ncleft  in  his  chin:  perky  chap  with  a  bright  eye.  Begging  your \\npardon,  but  he  said  it,  not  me.’ \\n\\n‘He  said  it?  And  who  was  he?’  asked  Frodo  eagerly. \\n\\n‘Ah!  That  was  Gandalf,  if  you  know  who  I  mean.  A  wizard \\nthey  say  he  is,  but  he’s  a  good  friend  of  mine,  whether  or  no. \\nBut  now  I  don’t  know  what  he’ll  have  to  say  to  me,  if  I  see \\nhim  again:  turn  all  my  ale  sour  or  me  into  a  block  of  wood,  I \\nshouldn’t  wonder.  He’s  a  bit  hasty.  Still  what’s  done  can’t  be \\nundone.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  what  have  you  done?’  said  Frodo,  getting  impatient \\nwith  the  slow  unravelling  of  Butterbur’s  thoughts. \\n\\n‘Where  was  I?’  said  the  landlord,  pausing  and  snapping  his \\nfingers.  ‘Ah,  yes!  Old  Gandalf.  Three  months  back  he  walked \\nright  into  my  room  without  a  knock.  Barley,  he  says,  I’m  off \\nin  the  morning.  Will  you  do  something  for  me?  You’ve  only  to \\nname  it,  I  said.  I’m  in  a  hurry,  said  he,  and  I’ve  no  time  myself, \\nbut  I  want  a  message  took  to  the  Shire.  Have  you  anyone  you \\ncan  send,  and  trust  to  go?  I  can  find  someone,  I  said,  tomorrow, \\nmaybe,  or  the  day  after.  Make  it  tomorrow,  he  says,  and  then \\nhe  gave  me  a  letter. \\n\\n‘It’s  addressed  plain  enough,’  said  Mr.  Butterbur,  pro¬ \\nducing  a  letter  from  his  pocket,  and  reading  out  the \\naddress  slowly  and  proudly  (he  valued  his  reputation  as  a \\nlettered  man) : \\n\\n\\nSTRIDER \\n\\n\\n219 \\n\\n\\nMr.  FRODO  BAGGINS,  BAG  END,  HOBBITON \\nin  the  SHIRE. \\n\\n‘A  letter  for  me  from  Gandalf !’  cried  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Ah!’  said  Mr.  Butterbur.  ‘Then  your  right  name  is \\nBaggins?’ \\n\\n‘It  is,’  said  Frodo,  ‘and  you  had  better  give  me  that  letter \\nat  once,  and  explain  why  you  never  sent  it.  That’s  what  you \\ncame  to  tell  me,  I  suppose,  though  you’ve  taken  a  long  time \\nto  come  to  the  point.’ \\n\\nPoor  Mr.  Butterbur  looked  troubled.  ‘You’re  right,  master,’ \\nhe  said,  ‘and  I  beg  your  pardon.  And  I’m  mortal  afraid  of \\nwhat  Gandalf  will  say,  if  harm  comes  of  it.  But  I  didn’t  keep \\nit  back  a-purpose.  I  put  it  by  safe.  Then  I  couldn’t  find \\nnobody  willing  to  go  to  the  Shire  next  day,  nor  the  day  after, \\nand  none  of  my  own  folk  were  to  spare;  and  then  one  thing \\nafter  another  drove  it  out  of  my  mind.  I’m  a  busy  man.  I’ll \\ndo  what  I  can  to  set  matters  right,  and  if  there’s  any  help  I \\ncan  give,  you’ve  only  to  name  it. \\n\\n‘Leaving  the  letter  aside,  I  promised  Gandalf  no  less. \\nBarley ,  he  says  to  me,  this  friend  of  mine  from  the  Shire,  he  may \\nbe  coming  out  this  way  before  long,  him  and  another.  He’ll  be \\ncalling  himself  Underhill.  Mind  that!  But  you  need  ask  no \\nquestions.  And  if  I’m  not  with  him,  he  may  be  in  trouble,  and  he \\nmay  need  help.  Do  whatever  you  can  for  him,  and  I’ll  be  grateful, \\nhe  says.  And  here  you  are,  and  trouble  is  not  far  off, \\nseemingly.’ \\n\\n‘What  do  you  mean?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘These  black  men,’  said  the  landlord  lowering  his  voice. \\n‘They’re  looking  for  Baggins,  and  if  they  mean  well,  then  I’m \\na  hobbit.  It  was  on  Monday,  and  all  the  dogs  were  yammering \\nand  the  geese  screaming.  Uncanny,  I  called  it.  Nob,  he  came \\nand  told  me  that  two  black  men  were  at  the  door  asking  for \\na  hobbit  called  Baggins.  Nob’s  hair  was  all  stood  on  end.  I \\nbid  the  black  fellows  be  off,  and  slammed  the  door  on  them; \\nbut  they’ve  been  asking  the  same  question  all  the  way  to \\nArchet,  I  hear.  And  that  Ranger,  Strider,  he’s  been  asking \\n\\n\\n220 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nquestions,  too.  Tried  to  get  in  here  to  see  you,  before  you’d \\nhad  bite  or  sup,  he  did.’ \\n\\n‘He  did!’  said  Strider  suddenly,  coming  forward  into  the \\nlight.  ‘And  much  trouble  would  have  been  saved,  if  you  had \\nlet  him  in,  Barliman.’ \\n\\nThe  landlord  jumped  with  surprise.  ‘You!’  he  cried. \\n‘You’re  always  popping  up.  What  do  you  want  now?’ \\n\\n‘He’s  here  with  my  leave,’  said  Frodo.  ‘He  came  to  offer \\nme  his  help.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  you  know  your  own  business,  maybe,’  said  Mr. \\nButterbur,  looking  suspiciously  at  Strider.  ‘But  if  I  was  in \\nyour  plight,  I  wouldn’t  take  up  with  a  Ranger.’ \\n\\n‘Then  who  would  you  take  up  with?’  asked  Strider.  ‘A  fat \\ninnkeeper  who  only  remembers  his  own  name  because  people \\nshout  it  at  him  all  day?  They  cannot  stay  in  The  Pony  for \\never,  and  they  cannot  go  home.  They  have  a  long  road  before \\nthem.  Will  you  go  with  them  and  keep  the  black  men  off?’ \\n\\n‘Me?  Leave  Bree!  I  wouldn’t  do  that  for  any  money,’  said \\nMr.  Butterbur,  looking  really  scared.  ‘But  why  can’t  you  stay \\nhere  quiet  for  a  bit,  Mr.  Underhill?  What  are  all  these  queer \\ngoings  on?  What  are  these  black  men  after,  and  where  do \\nthey  come  from,  I’d  like  to  know?’ \\n\\n‘I’m  sorry  I  can’t  explain  it  all,’  answered  Frodo.  ‘I  am  tired \\nand  very  worried,  and  it’s  a  long  tale.  But  if  you  mean  to  help \\nme,  I  ought  to  warn  you  that  you  will  be  in  danger  as  long  as \\nI  am  in  your  house.  These  Black  Riders:  I  am  not  sure,  but \\nI  think,  I  fear  they  come  from - ’ \\n\\n‘They  come  from  Mordor,’  said  Strider  in  a  low  voice. \\n‘From  Mordor,  Barliman,  if  that  means  anything  to  you.’ \\n\\n‘Save  us!’  cried  Mr.  Butterbur  turning  pale;  the  name  evi¬ \\ndently  was  known  to  him.  ‘That  is  the  worst  news  that  has \\ncome  to  Bree  in  my  time.’ \\n\\n‘It  is,’  said  Frodo.  ‘Are  you  still  willing  to  help  me?’ \\n\\n‘I  am,’  said  Mr.  Butterbur.  ‘More  than  ever.  Though  I \\n\\ndon’t  know  what  the  likes  of  me  can  do  against,  against - ’ \\n\\nhe  faltered. \\n\\n‘Against  the  Shadow  in  the  East,’  said  Strider  quietly.  ‘Not \\n\\n\\nSTRIDER \\n\\n\\n221 \\n\\n\\nmuch,  Barliman,  but  every  little  helps.  You  can  let  Mr. \\nUnderhill  stay  here  tonight,  as  Mr.  Underhill;  and  you  can \\nforget  the  name  of  Baggins,  till  he  is  far  away.’ \\n\\n‘I’ll  do  that,’  said  Butterbur.  ‘But  they’ll  find  out  he’s  here \\nwithout  help  from  me,  I’m  afraid.  It’s  a  pity  Mr.  Baggins \\ndrew  attention  to  himself  this  evening,  to  say  no  more.  The \\nstory  of  that  Mr.  Bilbo’s  going  off  has  been  heard  before \\ntonight  in  Bree.  Even  our  Nob  has  been  doing  some  guessing \\nin  his  slow  pate;  and  there  are  others  in  Bree  quicker  in  the \\nuptake  than  he  is.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  we  can  only  hope  the  Riders  won’t  come  back  yet,’ \\nsaid  Frodo. \\n\\n‘I  hope  not,  indeed,’  said  Butterbur.  ‘But  spooks  or  no \\nspooks,  they  won’t  get  in  The  Pony  so  easy.  Don’t  you  worry \\ntill  the  morning.  Nob’ll  say  no  word.  No  black  man  shall  pass \\nmy  doors,  while  I  can  stand  on  my  legs.  Me  and  my  folk’ll  keep \\nwatch  tonight;  but  you  had  best  get  some  sleep,  if  you  can.’ \\n\\n‘In  any  case  we  must  be  called  at  dawn,’  said  Frodo.  ‘We \\nmust  get  off  as  early  as  possible.  Breakfast  at  six-thirty,  please.’ \\n\\n‘Right!  I’ll  see  to  the  orders,’  said  the  landlord.  ‘Good  night, \\nMr.  Baggins  -  Underhill,  I  should  say!  Good  night  -  now, \\nbless  me!  Where’s  your  Mr.  Brandybuck?’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know,’  said  Frodo  with  sudden  anxiety.  They  had \\nforgotten  all  about  Merry,  and  it  was  getting  late.  ‘I  am  afraid \\nhe  is  out.  He  said  something  about  going  for  a  breath  of  air.’ \\n\\nWell,  you  do  want  looking  after  and  no  mistake:  your  party \\nmight  be  on  a  holiday!’  said  Butterbur.  ‘I  must  go  and  bar \\nthe  doors  quick,  but  I’ll  see  your  friend  is  let  in  when  he \\ncomes.  I’d  better  send  Nob  to  look  for  him.  Good  night  to \\nyou  all!’  At  last  Mr.  Butterbur  went  out,  with  another  doubt¬ \\nful  look  at  Strider  and  a  shake  of  his  head.  His  footsteps \\nretreated  down  the  passage. \\n\\n‘Well?’  said  Strider.  ‘When  are  you  going  to  open  that  letter?’ \\nFrodo  looked  carefully  at  the  seal  before  he  broke  it.  It  seemed \\ncertainly  to  be  Gandalf’s.  Inside,  written  in  the  wizard’s \\nstrong  but  graceful  script,  was  the  following  message: \\n\\n\\n222 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nTHE  PRANCING  PONY,  BREE.  Midyear’s  Day,  Shire  Year, \\n1418. \\n\\nDear  Frodo, \\n\\nBad  news  has  reached  me  here.  I  must  go  off  at  once.  You  had \\nbetter  leave  Bag  End  soon,  and  get  out  of  the  Shire  before  the  end \\nof  July  at  latest.  I  will  return  as  soon  as  I  can;  and  I  will  follow \\nyou,  if  I  find  that  you  are  gone.  Leave  a  message  for  me  here,  if \\nyou  pass  through  Bree.  You  can  trust  the  landlord  (Butterbur). \\nYou  may  meet  a  friend  of  mine  on  the  Road:  a  Man,  lean,  dark, \\ntall,  by  some  called  Strider.  He  knows  our  business  and  will  help \\nyou.  Make  for  Rivendell.  There  I  hope  we  may  meet  again.  If  I \\ndo  not  come,  Elrond  will  advise  you. \\n\\nYours  in  haste \\nGANDALF.  F \\n\\nPS.  Do  NO  T  use  It  again,  not  for  any  reason  whatever!  Do \\nnot  travel  by  night!  F \\n\\nPPS.  Make  sure  that  it  is  the  real  Strider.  There  are  many \\nstrange  men  on  the  roads.  His  true  name  is  Aragorn.  F \\n\\nAll  that  is  gold  does  not  glitter, \\n\\nNot  all  those  who  wander  are  lost; \\n\\nThe  old  that  is  strong  does  not  wither, \\n\\nDeep  roots  are  not  reached  by  the  frost. \\n\\nFrom  the  ashes  afire  shall  be  woken, \\n\\nA  light  from  the  shadows  shall  spring; \\n\\nRenewed  shall  be  blade  that  was  broken, \\n\\nThe  crownless  again  shall  be  king. \\n\\n\\nPPPS.  I  hope  Butterbur  sends  this  promptly, \\nman,  but  his  memory  is  like  a  lumber- \\nroom:  thing  wanted  always  buried. \\n\\nIf  he  forgets,  I  shall  roast  him.  * \\n\\nFare  Well! \\n\\n\\nA  worthy \\n\\n\\nSTRIDER \\n\\n\\n223 \\n\\n\\nFrodo  read  the  letter  to  himself,  and  then  passed  it  to \\nPippin  and  Sam.  ‘Really  old  Butterbur  has  made  a  mess  of \\nthings!’  he  said.  ‘He  deserves  roasting.  If  I  had  got  this  at \\nonce,  we  might  all  have  been  safe  in  Rivendell  by  now.  But \\nwhat  can  have  happened  to  Gandalf  ?  He  writes  as  if  he  was \\ngoing  into  great  danger.’ \\n\\n‘He  has  been  doing  that  for  many  years,’  said  Strider. \\n\\nFrodo  turned  and  looked  at  him  thoughtfully,  wondering \\nabout  Gandalf ’s  second  postscript.  ‘Why  didn’t  you  tell  me \\nthat  you  were  Gandalf ’s  friend  at  once?’  he  asked.  ‘It  would \\nhave  saved  time.’ \\n\\n‘Would  it?  Would  any  of  you  have  believed  me  till  now?’ \\nsaid  Sttider.  ‘I  knew  nothing  of  this  letter.  For  all  I  knew  I \\nhad  to  persuade  you  to  trust  me  without  proofs,  if  I  was  to \\nhelp  you.  In  any  case,  I  did  not  intend  to  tell  you  all  about \\nmyself  at  once.  I  had  to  study  you  first,  and  make  sure \\nof  you.  The  Enemy  has  set  traps  for  me  before  now.  As \\nsoon  as  I  had  made  up  my  mind,  I  was  ready  to  tell  you \\nwhatever  you  asked.  But  I  must  admit,’  he  added  with  a \\nqueer  laugh,  ‘that  I  hoped  you  would  take  to  me  for  my \\nown  sake.  A  hunted  man  sometimes  wearies  of  distrust  and \\nlongs  for  friendship.  But  there,  I  believe  my  looks  are  against \\nme.’ \\n\\n‘They  are  -  at  first  sight  at  any  rate,’  laughed  Pippin  with \\nsudden  relief  after  reading  Gandalf ’s  letter.  ‘But  handsome \\nis  as  handsome  does,  as  we  say  in  the  Shire;  and  I  daresay \\nwe  shall  all  look  much  the  same  after  lying  for  days  in  hedges \\nand  ditches.’ \\n\\n‘It  would  take  more  than  a  few  days,  or  weeks,  or  years,  of \\nwandering  in  the  Wild  to  make  you  look  like  Strider,’  he \\nanswered.  ‘And  you  would  die  first,  unless  you  are  made  of \\nsterner  stuff  than  you  look  to  be.’ \\n\\nPippin  subsided;  but  Sam  was  not  daunted,  and  he  still \\neyed  Strider  dubiously.  ‘How  do  we  know  you  are  the  Strider \\nthat  Gandalf  speaks  about?’  he  demanded.  ‘You  never  men¬ \\ntioned  Gandalf,  till  this  letter  came  out.  You  might  be  a \\nplay-acting  spy,  for  all  I  can  see,  trying  to  get  us  to  go  with \\n\\n\\n224 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nyou.  You  might  have  done  in  the  real  Strider  and  took  his \\nclothes.  What  have  you  to  say  to  that?’ \\n\\n‘That  you  are  a  stout  fellow,’  answered  Strider;  ‘but  I  am \\nafraid  my  only  answer  to  you,  Sam  Gamgee,  is  this.  If  I  had \\nkilled  the  real  Strider,  I  could  kill  you.  And  I  should  have \\nkilled  you  already  without  so  much  talk.  If  I  was  after  the \\nRing,  I  could  have  it  -  now!’ \\n\\nHe  stood  up,  and  seemed  suddenly  to  grow  taller.  In  his \\neyes  gleamed  a  light,  keen  and  commanding.  Throwing  back \\nhis  cloak,  he  laid  his  hand  on  the  hilt  of  a  sword  that  had \\nhung  concealed  by  his  side.  They  did  not  dare  to  move.  Sam \\nsat  wide-mouthed  staring  at  him  dumbly. \\n\\n‘But  I  am  the  real  Strider,  fortunately,’  he  said,  looking \\ndown  at  them  with  his  face  softened  by  a  sudden  smile.  ‘I  am \\nAragorn  son  of  Arathorn;  and  if  by  life  or  death  I  can  save \\nyou,  I  will.’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  long  silence.  At  last  Frodo  spoke  with  hesita¬ \\ntion.  ‘I  believed  that  you  were  a  friend  before  the  letter  came,’ \\nhe  said,  ‘or  at  least  I  wished  to.  You  have  frightened  me \\nseveral  times  tonight,  but  never  in  the  way  that  servants  of \\nthe  Enemy  would,  or  so  I  imagine.  I  think  one  of  his  spies \\nwould  -  well,  seem  fairer  and  feel  fouler,  if  you  understand.’ \\n\\n‘I  see,’  laughed  Strider.  ‘I  look  foul  and  feel  fair.  Is  that  it? \\nAll  that  is  gold  does  not  glitter,  not  all  those  who  wander  are  lost .’ \\n\\n‘Did  the  verses  apply  to  you  then?’  asked  Frodo.  ‘I  could \\nnot  make  out  what  they  were  about.  But  how  did  you  know \\nthat  they  were  in  Gandalf ’s  letter,  if  you  have  never  seen  it?’ \\n\\n‘I  did  not  know,’  he  answered.  ‘But  I  am  Aragorn,  and \\nthose  verses  go  with  that  name.’  He  drew  out  his  sword,  and \\nthey  saw  that  the  blade  was  indeed  broken  a  foot  below  the \\nhilt.  ‘Not  much  use  is  it,  Sam?’  said  Strider.  ‘But  the  time  is \\nnear  when  it  shall  be  forged  anew.’ \\n\\nSam  said  nothing. \\n\\n‘Well,’  said  Strider,  ‘with  Sam’s  permission  we  will  call  that \\nsettled.  Strider  shall  be  your  guide.  And  now  I  think  it  is  time \\nyou  went  to  bed  and  took  what  rest  you  can.  We  shall  have \\n\\n\\nSTRIDER \\n\\n\\n225 \\n\\n\\na  rough  road  tomorrow.  Even  if  we  are  allowed  to  leave  Bree \\nunhindered,  we  can  hardly  hope  now  to  leave  it  unnoticed. \\nBut  I  shall  try  to  get  lost  as  soon  as  possible.  I  know  one  or \\ntwo  ways  out  of  Bree-land  other  than  the  main  road.  If  once \\nwe  shake  off  the  pursuit,  I  shall  make  for  Weathertop.’ \\n\\n‘Weathertop?’  said  Sam.  ‘What’s  that?’ \\n\\n‘It  is  a  hill,  just  to  the  north  of  the  Road,  about  half  way \\nfrom  here  to  Rivendell.  It  commands  a  wide  view  all  round; \\nand  there  we  shall  have  a  chance  to  look  about  us.  Gandalf \\nwill  make  for  that  point,  if  he  follows  us.  After  Weathertop \\nour  journey  will  become  more  difficult,  and  we  shall  have  to \\nchoose  between  various  dangers.’ \\n\\n‘When  did  you  last  see  Gandalf?’  asked  Frodo.  ‘Do  you \\nknow  where  he  is,  or  what  he  is  doing?’ \\n\\nStrider  looked  grave.  ‘I  do  not  know,’  he  said.  ‘I  came  west \\nwith  him  in  the  spring.  I  have  often  kept  watch  on  the  borders \\nof  the  Shire  in  the  last  few  years,  when  he  was  busy  elsewhere. \\nHe  seldom  left  it  unguarded.  We  last  met  on  the  first  of  May: \\nat  Sarn  Ford  down  the  Brandywine.  He  told  me  that  his \\nbusiness  with  you  had  gone  well,  and  that  you  would  be \\nstarting  for  Rivendell  in  the  last  week  of  September.  As  I \\nknew  he  was  at  your  side,  I  went  away  on  a  journey  of  my \\nown.  And  that  has  proved  ill;  for  plainly  some  news  reached \\nhim,  and  I  was  not  at  hand  to  help. \\n\\n‘I  am  troubled,  for  the  first  time  since  I  have  known  him. \\nWe  should  have  had  messages,  even  if  he  could  not  come \\nhimself.  When  I  returned,  many  days  ago,  I  heard  the  ill \\nnews.  The  tidings  had  gone  far  and  wide  that  Gandalf \\nwas  missing  and  the  horsemen  had  been  seen.  It  was  the \\nEl vcn -folk  of  Gildor  that  told  me  this;  and  later  they  told  me \\nthat  you  had  left  your  home;  but  there  was  no  news  of  your \\nleaving  Buckland.  I  have  been  watching  the  East  Road \\nanxiously.’ \\n\\n‘Do  you  think  the  Black  Riders  have  anything  to  do  with \\nit  -  with  Gandalf ’s  absence,  I  mean?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘I  do  not  know  of  anything  else  that  could  have  hindered \\nhim,  except  the  Enemy  himself,’  said  Strider.  ‘But  do  not \\n\\n\\n226 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\ngive  up  hope!  Gandalf  is  greater  than  you  Shire-folk  know  - \\nas  a  rule  you  can  only  see  his  jokes  and  toys.  But  this  business \\nof  ours  will  be  his  greatest  task.’ \\n\\nPippin  yawned.  ‘I  am  sorry,’  he  said,  ‘but  I  am  dead  tired. \\nIn  spite  of  all  the  danger  and  worry  I  must  go  to  bed,  or \\nsleep  where  I  sit.  Where  is  that  silly  fellow,  Merry?  It  would \\nbe  the  last  straw,  if  we  had  to  go  out  in  the  dark  to  look  for \\nhim.’ \\n\\nAt  that  moment  they  heard  a  door  slam;  then  feet  came \\nrunning  along  the  passage.  Merry  came  in  with  a  rush  fol¬ \\nlowed  by  Nob.  He  shut  the  door  hastily,  and  leaned  against \\nit.  He  was  out  of  breath.  They  stared  at  him  in  alarm  for  a \\nmoment  before  he  gasped:  ‘I  have  seen  them,  Frodo!  I  have \\nseen  them!  Black  Riders!’ \\n\\n‘Black  Riders!’  cried  Frodo.  ‘Where?’ \\n\\n‘Here.  In  the  village.  I  stayed  indoors  for  an  hour.  Then  as \\nyou  did  not  come  back,  I  went  out  for  a  stroll.  I  had  come \\nback  again  and  was  standing  just  outside  the  light  of  the \\nlamp  looking  at  the  stars.  Suddenly  I  shivered  and  felt  that \\nsomething  horrible  was  creeping  near:  there  was  a  sort  of \\ndeeper  shade  among  the  shadows  across  the  road,  just  beyond \\nthe  edge  of  the  lamplight.  It  slid  away  at  once  into  the  dark \\nwithout  a  sound.  There  was  no  horse.’ \\n\\nWhich  way  did  it  go?’  asked  Strider,  suddenly  and  sharply. \\n\\nMerry  started,  noticing  the  stranger  for  the  first  time.  ‘Go \\non!’  said  Frodo.  ‘This  is  a  friend  of  Gandalf ’s.  I  will  explain \\nlater.’ \\n\\n‘It  seemed  to  make  off  up  the  Road,  eastward,’  continued \\nMerry.  ‘I  tried  to  follow.  Of  course,  it  vanished  almost  at \\nonce;  but  I  went  round  the  corner  and  on  as  far  as  the  last \\nhouse  on  the  Road.’ \\n\\nStrider  looked  at  Merry  with  wonder.  ‘You  have  a  stout \\nheart,’  he  said;  ‘but  it  was  foolish.’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know,’  said  Merry.  ‘Neither  brave  nor  silly,  I  think. \\nI  could  hardly  help  myself.  I  seemed  to  be  drawn  somehow. \\nAnyway,  I  went,  and  suddenly  I  heard  voices  by  the  hedge. \\n\\n\\nSTRIDER \\n\\n\\n227 \\n\\n\\nOne  was  muttering;  and  the  other  was  whispering,  or  hissing. \\nI  couldn’t  hear  a  word  that  was  said.  I  did  not  creep  any \\ncloser,  because  I  began  to  tremble  all  over.  Then  I  felt  terri¬ \\nfied,  and  I  turned  back,  and  was  just  going  to  bolt  home, \\nwhen  something  came  behind  me  and  I  ...  I  fell  over.’ \\n\\n‘I  found  him,  sir,’  put  in  Nob.  ‘Mr.  Butterbur  sent  me  out \\nwith  a  lantern.  I  went  down  to  West-gate,  and  then  back  up \\ntowards  South-gate.  Just  nigh  Bill  Ferny’s  house  I  thought  I \\ncould  see  something  in  the  Road.  I  couldn’t  swear  to  it,  but \\nit  looked  to  me  as  if  two  men  was  stooping  over  something, \\nlifting  it.  I  gave  a  shout,  but  when  I  got  up  to  the  spot  there \\nwas  no  signs  of  them,  and  only  Mr.  Brandybuck  lying  by  the \\nroadside.  He  seemed  to  be  asleep.  “I  thought  I  had  fallen  into \\ndeep  water,”  he  says  to  me,  when  I  shook  him.  Very  queer \\nhe  was,  and  as  soon  as  I  had  roused  him,  he  got  up  and  ran \\nback  here  like  a  hare.’ \\n\\n‘I  am  afraid  that’s  true,’  said  Merry,  ‘though  I  don’t  know \\nwhat  I  said.  I  had  an  ugly  dream,  which  I  can’t  remember. \\nI  went  to  pieces.  I  don’t  know  what  came  over  me.’ \\n\\n‘I  do,’  said  Strider.  ‘The  Black  Breath.  The  Riders  must \\nhave  left  their  horses  outside,  and  passed  back  through  the \\nSouth-gate  in  secret.  They  will  know  all  the  news  now,  for \\nthey  have  visited  Bill  Ferny;  and  probably  that  Southerner \\nwas  a  spy  as  well.  Something  may  happen  in  the  night,  before \\nwe  leave  Bree.’ \\n\\n‘What  will  happen?’  said  Merry.  ‘Will  they  attack  the  inn?’ \\n\\n‘No,  I  think  not,’  said  Strider.  ‘They  are  not  all  here  yet. \\nAnd  in  any  case  that  is  not  their  way.  In  dark  and  loneliness \\nthey  are  strongest;  they  will  not  openly  attack  a  house  where \\nthere  are  lights  and  many  people  -  not  until  they  are  des¬ \\nperate,  not  while  all  the  long  leagues  of  Eriador  still  lie  before \\nus.  But  their  power  is  in  terror,  and  already  some  in  Bree  are \\nin  their  clutch.  They  will  drive  these  wretches  to  some  evil \\nwork:  Ferny,  and  some  of  the  strangers,  and,  maybe,  the \\ngatekeeper  too.  They  had  words  with  Harry  at  West-gate  on \\nMonday.  I  was  watching  them.  He  was  white  and  shaking \\nwhen  they  left  him.’ \\n\\n\\n228 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘We  seem  to  have  enemies  all  round,’  said  Frodo.  What \\nare  we  to  do?’ \\n\\n‘Stay  here,  and  do  not  go  to  your  rooms!  They  are  sure  to \\nhave  found  out  which  those  are.  The  hobbit-rooms  have \\nwindows  looking  north  and  close  to  the  ground.  We  will  all \\nremain  together  and  bar  this  window  and  the  door.  But  first \\nNob  and  I  will  fetch  your  luggage.’ \\n\\nWhile  Strider  was  gone,  Frodo  gave  Merry  a  rapid  account \\nof  all  that  had  happened  since  supper.  Merry  was  still  read¬ \\ning  and  pondering  Gandalf’s  letter  when  Strider  and  Nob \\nreturned. \\n\\nWell  Masters,’  said  Nob,  ‘I’ve  ruffled  up  the  clothes  and \\nput  in  a  bolster  down  the  middle  of  each  bed.  And  I  made  a \\nnice  imitation  of  your  head  with  a  brown  woollen  mat,  Mr. \\nBag  -  Underhill,  sir,’  he  added  with  a  grin. \\n\\nPippin  laughed.  ‘Very  life-like!’  he  said.  ‘But  what  will \\nhappen  when  they  have  penetrated  the  disguise?’ \\n\\n‘We  shall  see,’  said  Strider.  ‘Let  us  hope  to  hold  the  fort \\ntill  morning.’ \\n\\n‘Good  night  to  you,’  said  Nob,  and  went  off  to  take  his \\npart  in  the  watch  on  the  doors. \\n\\nTheir  bags  and  gear  they  piled  on  the  parlour-floor.  They \\npushed  a  low  chair  against  the  door  and  shut  the  window. \\nPeering  out,  Frodo  saw  that  the  night  was  still  clear.  The \\nSickle*  was  swinging  bright  above  the  shoulders  of  Bree-hill. \\nHe  then  closed  and  barred  the  heavy  inside  shutters  and  drew \\nthe  curtains  together.  Strider  built  up  the  fire  and  blew  out \\nall  the  candles. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  lay  down  on  their  blankets  with  their  feet \\ntowards  the  hearth;  but  Strider  settled  himself  in  the  chair \\nagainst  the  door.  They  talked  for  a  little,  for  Merry  still  had \\nseveral  questions  to  ask. \\n\\n‘Jumped  over  the  Moon!’  chuckled  Merry  as  he  rolled  him¬ \\nself  in  his  blanket.  ‘Very  ridiculous  of  you,  Frodo!  But  I  wish \\n\\n\\n*  The  Hobbits’  name  for  the  Plough  or  Great  Bear. \\n\\n\\nSTRIDER  229 \\n\\nI  had  been  there  to  see.  The  worthies  of  Bree  will  be  dis¬ \\ncussing  it  a  hundred  years  hence.’ \\n\\n‘I  hope  so,’  said  Strider.  Then  they  all  fell  silent,  and  one \\nby  one  the  hobbits  dropped  off  to  sleep. \\n\\n\\nChapter  n \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\nAs  they  prepared  for  sleep  in  the  inn  at  Bree,  darkness  lay  on \\nBuckland;  a  mist  strayed  in  the  dells  and  along  the  river-bank. \\nThe  house  at  Crickhollow  stood  silent.  Fatty  Bolger  opened \\nthe  door  cautiously  and  peered  out.  A  feeling  of  fear  had \\nbeen  growing  on  him  all  day,  and  he  was  unable  to  rest  or  go \\nto  bed:  there  was  a  brooding  threat  in  the  breathless  night-air. \\nAs  he  stared  out  into  the  gloom,  a  black  shadow  moved  under \\nthe  trees;  the  gate  seemed  to  open  of  its  own  accord  and  close \\nagain  without  a  sound.  Terror  seized  him.  He  shrank  back, \\nand  for  a  moment  he  stood  trembling  in  the  hall.  Then  he \\nshut  and  locked  the  door. \\n\\nThe  night  deepened.  There  came  the  soft  sound  of  horses \\nled  with  stealth  along  the  lane.  Outside  the  gate  they  stopped, \\nand  three  black  figures  entered,  like  shades  of  night  creeping \\nacross  the  ground.  One  went  to  the  door,  one  to  the  corner \\nof  the  house  on  either  side;  and  there  they  stood,  as  still  as \\nthe  shadows  of  stones,  while  night  went  slowly  on.  The  house \\nand  the  quiet  trees  seemed  to  be  waiting  breathlessly. \\n\\nThere  was  a  faint  stir  in  the  leaves,  and  a  cock  crowed  far \\naway.  The  cold  hour  before  dawn  was  passing.  The  figure \\nby  the  door  moved.  In  the  dark  without  moon  or  stars  a \\ndrawn  blade  gleamed,  as  if  a  chill  light  had  been  unsheathed. \\nThere  was  a  blow,  soft  but  heavy,  and  the  door  shuddered. \\n\\n‘Open,  in  the  name  of  Mordor!’  said  a  voice  thin  and \\nmenacing. \\n\\nAt  a  second  blow  the  door  yielded  and  fell  back,  with \\ntimbers  burst  and  lock  broken.  The  black  figures  passed \\nswiftly  in. \\n\\nAt  that  moment,  among  the  trees  nearby,  a  horn  rang  out. \\nIt  rent  the  night  like  fire  on  a  hill-top. \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n231 \\n\\n\\nawaice!  fear!  fire!  foes!  awake! \\n\\nFatty  Bolger  had  not  been  idle.  As  soon  as  he  saw  the  dark \\nshapes  creep  from  the  garden,  he  knew  that  he  must  run  for \\nit,  or  perish.  And  run  he  did,  out  of  the  back  door,  through \\nthe  garden,  and  over  the  fields.  When  he  reached  the  nearest \\nhouse,  more  than  a  mile  away,  he  collapsed  on  the  doorstep. \\n‘No,  no,  no!’  he  was  crying.  ‘No,  not  me!  I  haven’t  got  it!’  It \\nwas  some  time  before  anyone  could  make  out  what  he  was \\nbabbling  about.  At  last  they  got  the  idea  that  enemies  were \\nin  Buckland,  some  strange  invasion  from  the  Old  Forest.  And \\nthen  they  lost  no  more  time. \\n\\nfear!  fire!  foes! \\n\\nThe  Brandybucks  were  blowing  the  Horn-call  of  Buckland, \\nthat  had  not  been  sounded  for  a  hundred  years,  not  since  the \\nwhite  wolves  came  in  the  Fell  Winter,  when  the  Brandywine \\nwas  frozen  over. \\n\\n\\nawake!  awake! \\n\\nFar  away  answering  horns  were  heard.  The  alarm  was \\nspreading. \\n\\nThe  black  figures  fled  from  the  house.  One  of  them  let  fall \\na  hobbit-cloak  on  the  step,  as  he  ran.  In  the  lane  the  noise  of \\nhoofs  broke  out,  and  gathering  to  a  gallop,  went  hammering \\naway  into  the  darkness.  All  about  Crickhollow  there  was  the \\nsound  of  horns  blowing,  and  voices  crying  and  feet  running. \\nBut  the  Black  Riders  rode  like  a  gale  to  the  North-gate.  Let \\nthe  little  people  blow!  Sauron  would  deal  with  them  later. \\nMeanwhile  they  had  another  errand:  they  knew  now  that  the \\nhouse  was  empty  and  the  Ring  had  gone.  They  rode  down \\nthe  guards  at  the  gate  and  vanished  from  the  Shire. \\n\\n\\n232  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nIn  the  early  night  Frodo  woke  from  deep  sleep,  suddenly, \\nas  if  some  sound  or  presence  had  disturbed  him.  He  saw  that \\nStrider  was  sitting  alert  in  his  chair:  his  eyes  gleamed  in  the \\nlight  of  the  fire,  which  had  been  tended  and  was  burning \\nbrightly;  but  he  made  no  sign  or  movement. \\n\\nFrodo  soon  went  to  sleep  again;  but  his  dreams  were  again \\ntroubled  with  the  noise  of  wind  and  of  galloping  hoofs.  The \\nwind  seemed  to  be  curling  round  the  house  and  shaking  it; \\nand  far  off  he  heard  a  horn  blowing  wildly.  He  opened  his \\neyes,  and  heard  a  cock  crowing  lustily  in  the  inn-yard.  Strider \\nhad  drawn  the  curtains  and  pushed  back  the  shutters  with  a \\nclang.  The  first  grey  light  of  day  was  in  the  room,  and  a  cold \\nair  was  coming  through  the  open  window. \\n\\nAs  soon  as  Strider  had  roused  them  all,  he  led  the  way  to \\ntheir  bedrooms.  When  they  saw  them  they  were  glad  that \\nthey  had  taken  his  advice:  the  windows  had  been  forced  open \\nand  were  swinging,  and  the  curtains  were  flapping;  the  beds \\nwere  tossed  about,  and  the  bolsters  slashed  and  flung  upon \\nthe  floor;  the  brown  mat  was  torn  to  pieces. \\n\\nStrider  immediately  went  to  fetch  the  landlord.  Poor  Mr. \\nButterbur  looked  sleepy  and  frightened.  He  had  hardly  closed \\nhis  eyes  all  night  (so  he  said),  but  he  had  never  heard  a  sound. \\n\\n‘Never  has  such  a  thing  happened  in  my  time!’  he  cried, \\nraising  his  hands  in  horror.  ‘Guests  unable  to  sleep  in  their \\nbeds,  and  good  bolsters  ruined  and  all!  What  are  we  coming \\nto?’ \\n\\n‘Dark  times,’  said  Strider.  ‘But  for  the  present  you  may  be \\nleft  in  peace,  when  you  have  got  rid  of  us.  We  will  leave  at \\nonce.  Never  mind  about  breakfast:  a  drink  and  a  bite  standing \\nwill  have  to  do.  We  shall  be  packed  in  a  few  minutes.’ \\n\\nMr.  Butterbur  hurried  off  to  see  that  their  ponies  were  got \\nready,  and  to  fetch  them  a  ‘bite’.  But  very  soon  he  came  back \\nin  dismay.  The  ponies  had  vanished!  The  stable-doors  had \\nall  been  opened  in  the  night,  and  they  were  gone:  not  only \\nMerry’s  ponies,  but  every  other  horse  and  beast  in  the  place. \\n\\nFrodo  was  crushed  by  the  news.  How  could  they  hope  to \\nreach  Rivendell  on  foot,  pursued  by  mounted  enemies?  They \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n233 \\n\\n\\nmight  as  well  set  out  for  the  Moon.  Strider  sat  silent  for  a \\nwhile,  looking  at  the  hobbits,  as  if  he  was  weighing  up  their \\nstrength  and  courage. \\n\\n‘Ponies  would  not  help  us  to  escape  horsemen,’  he  said  at \\nlast,  thoughtfully,  as  if  he  guessed  what  Frodo  had  in  mind. \\n‘We  should  not  go  much  slower  on  foot,  not  on  the  roads \\nthat  I  mean  to  take.  I  was  going  to  walk  in  any  case.  It  is  the \\nfood  and  stores  that  trouble  me.  We  cannot  count  on  getting \\nanything  to  eat  between  here  and  Rivendell,  except  what  we \\ntake  with  us;  and  we  ought  to  take  plenty  to  spare;  for  we \\nmay  be  delayed,  or  forced  to  go  round-about,  far  out  of  the \\ndirect  way.  How  much  are  you  prepared  to  carry  on  your \\nbacks?’ \\n\\n‘As  much  as  we  must,’  said  Pippin  with  a  sinking  heart, \\nbut  trying  to  show  that  he  was  tougher  than  he  looked  (or \\nfelt). \\n\\n‘I  can  carry  enough  for  two,’  said  Sam  defiantly. \\n\\n‘Can’t  anything  be  done,  Mr.  Butterbur?’  asked  Frodo. \\n‘Can’t  we  get  a  couple  of  ponies  in  the  village,  or  even  one \\njust  for  the  baggage?  I  don’t  suppose  we  could  hire  them, \\nbut  we  might  be  able  to  buy  them,’  he  added,  doubtfully, \\nwondering  if  he  could  afford  it. \\n\\n‘I  doubt  it,’  said  the  landlord  unhappily.  ‘The  two  or  three \\nriding-ponies  that  there  were  in  Bree  were  stabled  in  my  yard, \\nand  they’re  gone.  As  for  other  animals,  horses  or  ponies  for \\ndraught  or  what  not,  there  are  very  few  of  them  in  Bree,  and \\nthey  won’t  be  for  sale.  But  I’ll  do  what  I  can.  I’ll  rout  out  Bob \\nand  send  him  round  as  soon  as  may  be.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  Strider  reluctantly,  ‘you  had  better  do  that.  I  am \\nafraid  we  shall  have  to  try  to  get  one  pony  at  least.  But  so \\nends  all  hope  of  starting  early,  and  slipping  away  quietly!  We \\nmight  as  well  have  blown  a  horn  to  announce  our  departure. \\nThat  was  part  of  their  plan,  no  doubt.’ \\n\\n‘There  is  one  crumb  of  comfort,’  said  Merry,  ‘and  more \\nthan  a  crumb,  I  hope:  we  can  have  breakfast  while  we  wait  - \\nand  sit  down  to  it.  Let’s  get  hold  of  Nob!’ \\n\\n\\n234 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nIn  the  end  there  was  more  than  three  hours’  delay.  Bob \\ncame  back  with  the  report  that  no  horse  or  pony  was  to  be \\ngot  for  love  or  money  in  the  neighbourhood  -  except  one: \\nBill  Ferny  had  one  that  he  might  possibly  sell.  ‘A  poor  old \\nhalf-starved  creature  it  is,’  said  Bob;  ‘but  he  won’t  part  with \\nit  for  less  than  thrice  its  worth,  seeing  how  you’re  placed,  not \\nif  I  knows  Bill  Ferny.’ \\n\\n‘Bill  Ferny?’  said  Frodo.  ‘Isn’t  there  some  trick?  Wouldn’t \\nthe  beast  bolt  back  to  him  with  all  our  stuff,  or  help  in  tracking \\nus,  or  something?’ \\n\\n‘I  wonder,’  said  Strider.  ‘But  I  cannot  imagine  any  animal \\nrunning  home  to  him,  once  it  got  away.  I  fancy  this  is  only \\nan  afterthought  of  kind  Master  Ferny’s:  just  a  way  of  increas¬ \\ning  his  profits  from  the  affair.  The  chief  danger  is  that  the \\npoor  beast  is  probably  at  death’s  door.  But  there  does  not \\nseem  any  choice.  What  does  he  want  for  it?’ \\n\\nBill  Ferny’s  price  was  twelve  silver  pennies;  and  that  was \\nindeed  at  least  three  times  the  pony’s  value  in  those  parts.  It \\nproved  to  be  a  bony,  underfed,  and  dispirited  animal;  but \\nit  did  not  look  like  dying  just  yet.  Mr.  Butterbur  paid  for  it \\nhimself,  and  offered  Merry  another  eighteen  pence  as  some \\ncompensation  for  the  lost  animals.  He  was  an  honest  man, \\nand  well-off  as  things  were  reckoned  in  Bree;  but  thirty  silver \\npennies  was  a  sore  blow  to  him,  and  being  cheated  by  Bill \\nFerny  made  it  harder  to  bear. \\n\\nAs  a  matter  of  fact  he  came  out  on  the  right  side  in  the \\nend.  It  turned  out  later  that  only  one  horse  had  been  actually \\nstolen.  The  others  had  been  driven  off,  or  had  bolted  in \\nterror,  and  were  found  wandering  in  different  corners  of \\nthe  Bree-land.  Merry’s  ponies  had  escaped  altogether,  and \\neventually  (having  a  good  deal  of  sense)  they  made  their  way \\nto  the  Downs  in  search  of  Fatty  Lumpkin.  So  they  came \\nunder  the  care  of  Tom  Bombadil  for  a  while,  and  were  well- \\noff.  But  when  news  of  the  events  at  Bree  came  to  Tom’s  ears, \\nhe  sent  them  to  Mr.  Butterbur,  who  thus  got  five  good  beasts \\nat  a  very  fair  price.  They  had  to  work  harder  in  Bree,  but \\nBob  treated  them  well;  so  on  the  whole  they  were  lucky:  they \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK  235 \\n\\nmissed  a  dark  and  dangerous  journey.  But  they  never  came \\nto  Rivendell. \\n\\nHowever,  in  the  meanwhile  for  all  Mr.  Butterbur  knew  his \\nmoney  was  gone  for  good,  or  for  bad.  And  he  had  other \\ntroubles.  For  there  was  a  great  commotion  as  soon  as  the \\nremaining  guests  were  astir  and  heard  news  of  the  raid  on \\nthe  inn.  The  southern  travellers  had  lost  several  horses  and \\nblamed  the  innkeeper  loudly,  until  it  became  known  that  one \\nof  their  own  number  had  also  disappeared  in  the  night,  none \\nother  than  Bill  Ferny’s  squint-eyed  companion.  Suspicion  fell \\non  him  at  once. \\n\\n‘If  you  pick  up  with  a  horse-thief,  and  bring  him  to  my \\nhouse,’  said  Butterbur  angrily,  ‘you  ought  to  pay  for  all  the \\ndamage  yourselves  and  not  come  shouting  at  me.  Go  and  ask \\nFerny  where  your  handsome  friend  is!’  But  it  appeared  that \\nhe  was  nobody’s  friend,  and  nobody  could  recollect  when  he \\nhad  joined  their  party. \\n\\nAfter  their  breakfast  the  hobbits  had  to  re -pack,  and  get \\ntogether  further  supplies  for  the  longer  journey  they  were \\nnow  expecting.  It  was  close  on  ten  o’clock  before  they  at  last \\ngot  off.  By  that  time  the  whole  of  Bree  was  buzzing  with \\nexcitement.  Frodo’s  vanishing  trick;  the  appearance  of  the \\nblack  horsemen;  the  robbing  of  the  stables;  and  not  least \\nthe  news  that  Strider  the  Ranger  had  joined  the  mysterious \\nhobbits,  made  such  a  tale  as  would  last  for  many  uneventful \\nyears.  Most  of  the  inhabitants  of  Bree  and  Staddle,  and  many \\neven  from  Combe  and  Archet,  were  crowded  in  the  road  to \\nsee  the  travellers  start.  The  other  guests  in  the  inn  were  at \\nthe  doors  or  hanging  out  of  the  windows. \\n\\nStrider  had  changed  his  mind,  and  had  decided  to  leave \\nBree  by  the  main  road.  Any  attempt  to  set  off  across  country \\nat  once  would  only  make  matters  worse:  half  the  inhabitants \\nwould  follow  them,  to  see  what  they  were  up  to,  and  to \\nprevent  them  from  trespassing. \\n\\nThey  said  farewell  to  Nob  and  Bob,  and  took  leave  of  Mr. \\nButterbur  with  many  thanks.  ‘I  hope  we  shall  meet  again \\n\\n\\n236 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nsome  day,  when  things  are  merry  once  more,’  said  Frodo.  ‘I \\nshould  like  nothing  better  than  to  stay  in  your  house  in  peace \\nfor  a  while.’ \\n\\nThey  tramped  off,  anxious  and  downhearted,  under  the \\neyes  of  the  crowd.  Not  all  the  faces  were  friendly,  nor  all  the \\nwords  that  were  shouted.  But  Strider  seemed  to  be  held  in \\nawe  by  most  of  the  Bree-landers,  and  those  that  he  stared  at \\nshut  their  mouths  and  drew  away.  He  walked  in  front  with \\nFrodo;  next  came  Merry  and  Pippin;  and  last  came  Sam \\nleading  the  pony,  which  was  laden  with  as  much  of  their \\nbaggage  as  they  had  the  heart  to  give  it;  but  already  it  looked \\nless  dejected,  as  if  it  approved  of  the  change  in  its  fortunes. \\nSam  was  chewing  an  apple  thoughtfully.  He  had  a  pocket  full \\nof  them:  a  parting  present  from  Nob  and  Bob.  ‘Apples  for \\nwalking,  and  a  pipe  for  sitting,’  he  said.  ‘But  I  reckon  I’ll  miss \\nthem  both  before  long.’ \\n\\nThe  hobbits  took  no  notice  of  the  inquisitive  heads  that \\npeeped  out  of  doors,  or  popped  over  walls  and  fences,  as \\nthey  passed.  But  as  they  drew  near  to  the  further  gate,  Frodo \\nsaw  a  dark  ill-kept  house  behind  a  thick  hedge:  the  last  house \\nin  the  village.  In  one  of  the  windows  he  caught  a  glimpse  of \\na  sallow  face  with  sly,  slanting  eyes;  but  it  vanished  at  once. \\n\\n‘So  that’s  where  that  southerner  is  hiding!’  he  thought.  ‘He \\nlooks  more  than  half  like  a  goblin.’ \\n\\nOver  the  hedge  another  man  was  staring  boldly.  He  had \\nheavy  black  brows,  and  dark  scornful  eyes;  his  large  mouth \\ncurled  in  a  sneer.  He  was  smoking  a  short  black  pipe.  As  they \\napproached  he  took  it  out  of  his  mouth  and  spat. \\n\\n‘Morning,  Longshanks!’  he  said.  ‘Off  early?  Found  some \\nfriends  at  last?’  Strider  nodded,  but  did  not  answer. \\n\\n‘Morning,  my  little  friends!’  he  said  to  the  others.  ‘I  sup¬ \\npose  you  know  who  you’ve  taken  up  with?  That’s  Stick-at- \\nnaught  Strider,  that  is!  Though  I’ve  heard  other  names  not \\nso  pretty.  Watch  out  tonight!  And  you,  Sammie,  don’t  go \\nill-treating  my  poor  old  pony!  Pah!’  He  spat  again. \\n\\nSam  turned  quickly.  ‘And  you,  Ferny,’  he  said,  ‘put  your \\nugly  face  out  of  sight,  or  it  will  get  hurt.’  With  a  sudden  flick, \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n237 \\n\\n\\nquick  as  lightning,  an  apple  left  his  hand  and  hit  Bill  square \\non  the  nose.  He  ducked  too  late,  and  curses  came  from \\nbehind  the  hedge.  ‘Waste  of  a  good  apple,’  said  Sam  regret¬ \\nfully,  and  strode  on. \\n\\nAt  last  they  left  the  village  behind.  The  escort  of  children \\nand  stragglers  that  had  followed  them  got  tired  and  turned \\nback  at  the  South-gate.  Passing  through,  they  kept  on  along \\nthe  Road  for  some  miles.  It  bent  to  the  left,  curving  back  into \\nits  eastward  line  as  it  rounded  the  feet  of  Bree-hill,  and  then \\nit  began  to  run  swiftly  downwards  into  wooded  country.  To \\ntheir  left  they  could  see  some  of  the  houses  and  hobbit-holes \\nof  Staddle  on  the  gentler  south-eastern  slopes  of  the  hill; \\ndown  in  a  deep  hollow  away  north  of  the  Road  there  were \\nwisps  of  rising  smoke  that  showed  where  Combe  lay;  Archet \\nwas  hidden  in  the  trees  beyond. \\n\\nAfter  the  Road  had  run  down  some  way,  and  had  left \\nBree-hill  standing  tall  and  brown  behind,  they  came  on  a \\nnarrow  track  that  led  off  towards  the  North.  ‘This  is  where \\nwe  leave  the  open  and  take  to  cover,’  said  Strider. \\n\\n‘Not  a  “short  cut”,  I  hope,’  said  Pippin.  ‘Our  last  short  cut \\nthrough  woods  nearly  ended  in  disaster.’ \\n\\n‘Ah,  but  you  had  not  got  me  with  you  then,’  laughed \\nStrider.  ‘My  cuts,  short  or  long,  don’t  go  wrong.’  He  took  a \\nlook  up  and  down  the  Road.  No  one  was  in  sight;  and  he  led \\nthe  way  quickly  down  towards  the  wooded  valley. \\n\\nHis  plan,  as  far  as  they  could  understand  it  without  know¬ \\ning  the  country,  was  to  go  towards  Archet  at  first,  but  to  bear \\nright  and  pass  it  on  the  east,  and  then  to  steer  as  straight  as \\nhe  could  over  the  wild  lands  to  Weathertop  Hill.  In  that  way \\nthey  would,  if  all  went  well,  cut  off  a  great  loop  of  the  Road, \\nwhich  further  on  bent  southwards  to  avoid  the  Midgewater \\nMarshes.  But,  of  course,  they  would  have  to  pass  through \\nthe  marshes  themselves,  and  Strider’s  description  of  them \\nwas  not  encouraging. \\n\\nHowever,  in  the  meanwhile,  walking  was  not  unpleasant. \\nIndeed,  if  it  had  not  been  for  the  disturbing  events  of  the \\n\\n\\n238 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nnight  before,  they  would  have  enjoyed  this  part  of  the  journey \\nbetter  than  any  up  to  that  time.  The  sun  was  shining,  clear \\nbut  not  too  hot.  The  woods  in  the  valley  were  still  leafy  and \\nfull  of  colour,  and  seemed  peaceful  and  wholesome.  Strider \\nguided  them  confidently  among  the  many  crossing  paths, \\nalthough  left  to  themselves  they  would  soon  have  been  at  a \\nloss.  He  was  taking  a  wandering  course  with  many  turns  and \\ndoublings,  to  put  off  any  pursuit. \\n\\n‘Bill  Ferny  will  have  watched  where  we  left  the  Road,  for \\ncertain,’  he  said;  ‘though  I  don’t  think  he  will  follow  us  him¬ \\nself.  He  knows  the  land  round  here  well  enough,  but  he  knows \\nhe  is  not  a  match  for  me  in  a  wood.  It  is  what  he  may  tell \\nothers  that  I  am  afraid  of.  I  don’t  suppose  they  are  far  away. \\nIf  they  think  we  have  made  for  Archet,  so  much  the  better.’ \\n\\nWhether  because  of  Strider’s  skill  or  for  some  other  reason, \\nthey  saw  no  sign  and  heard  no  sound  of  any  other  living  thing \\nall  that  day:  neither  two-footed,  except  birds;  nor  four-footed, \\nexcept  one  fox  and  a  few  squirrels.  The  next  day  they  began \\nto  steer  a  steady  course  eastwards;  and  still  all  was  quiet  and \\npeaceful.  On  the  third  day  out  from  Bree  they  came  out  of  the \\nChetwood.  The  land  had  been  falling  steadily,  ever  since  they \\nturned  aside  from  the  Road,  and  they  now  entered  a  wide  flat \\nexpanse  of  country,  much  more  difficult  to  manage .  They  were \\nfar  beyond  the  borders  of  the  Bree-land,  out  in  the  pathless \\nwilderness,  and  drawing  near  to  the  Midgewater  Marshes. \\n\\nThe  ground  now  became  damp,  and  in  places  boggy  and \\nhere  and  there  they  came  upon  pools,  and  wide  stretches  of \\nreeds  and  rushes  filled  with  the  warbling  of  little  hidden  birds. \\nThey  had  to  pick  their  way  carefully  to  keep  both  dry-footed \\nand  on  their  proper  course.  At  first  they  made  fair  progress, \\nbut  as  they  went  on,  their  passage  became  slower  and  more \\ndangerous.  The  marshes  were  bewildering  and  treacherous, \\nand  there  was  no  permanent  trail  even  for  Rangers  to  find \\nthrough  their  shifting  quagmires.  The  flies  began  to  torment \\nthem,  and  the  air  was  full  of  clouds  of  tiny  midges  that  crept \\nup  their  sleeves  and  breeches  and  into  their  hair. \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK  239 \\n\\n‘I  am  being  eaten  alive!’  cried  Pippin.  ‘Midgewater!  There \\nare  more  midges  than  water!’ \\n\\n‘What  do  they  live  on  when  they  can’t  get  hobbit?’  asked \\nSam,  scratching  his  neck. \\n\\nThey  spent  a  miserable  day  in  this  lonely  and  unpleasant \\ncountry.  Their  camping-place  was  damp,  cold,  and  uncom¬ \\nfortable;  and  the  biting  insects  would  not  let  them  sleep. \\nThere  were  also  abominable  creatures  haunting  the  reeds  and \\ntussocks  that  from  the  sound  of  them  were  evil  relatives  of  the \\ncricket.  There  were  thousands  of  them,  and  they  squeaked  all \\nround,  neek-breek ,  breek-neek,  unceasingly  all  the  night,  until \\nthe  hobbits  were  nearly  frantic. \\n\\nThe  next  day,  the  fourth,  was  little  better,  and  the  night \\nalmost  as  comfortless.  Though  the  Neekerbreekers  (as  Sam \\ncalled  them)  had  been  left  behind,  the  midges  still  pursued \\nthem. \\n\\nAs  Frodo  lay,  tired  but  unable  to  close  his  eyes,  it  seemed \\nto  him  that  far  away  there  came  a  light  in  the  eastern  sky:  it \\nflashed  and  faded  many  times.  It  was  not  the  dawn,  for  that \\nwas  still  some  hours  off. \\n\\nWhat  is  the  light?’  he  said  to  Strider,  who  had  risen,  and \\nwas  standing,  gazing  ahead  into  the  night. \\n\\n‘I  do  not  know,’  Strider  answered.  ‘It  is  too  distant  to  make \\nout.  It  is  like  lightning  that  leaps  up  from  the  hill-tops.’ \\n\\nFrodo  lay  down  again,  but  for  a  long  while  he  could  still \\nsee  the  white  flashes,  and  against  them  the  tall  dark  figure  of \\nStrider,  standing  silent  and  watchful.  At  last  he  passed  into \\nuneasy  sleep. \\n\\nThey  had  not  gone  far  on  the  fifth  day  when  they  left  the \\nlast  straggling  pools  and  reed-beds  of  the  marshes  behind \\nthem.  The  land  before  them  began  steadily  to  rise  again. \\nAway  in  the  distance  eastward  they  could  now  see  a  line  of \\nhills.  The  highest  of  them  was  at  the  right  of  the  line  and  a \\nlittle  separated  from  the  others.  It  had  a  conical  top,  slightly \\nflattened  at  the  summit. \\n\\n‘That  is  Weathertop,’  said  Strider.  ‘The  Old  Road,  which \\n\\n\\n240  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nwe  have  left  far  away  on  our  right,  runs  to  the  south  of  it  and \\npasses  not  far  from  its  foot.  We  might  reach  it  by  noon \\ntomorrow,  if  we  go  straight  towards  it.  I  suppose  we  had \\nbetter  do  so.’ \\n\\nWhat  do  you  mean?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘I  mean:  when  we  do  get  there,  it  is  not  certain  what  we \\nshall  find.  It  is  close  to  the  Road.’ \\n\\n‘But  surely  we  were  hoping  to  find  Gandalf  there?’ \\n\\n‘Yes;  but  the  hope  is  faint.  If  he  comes  this  way  at  all,  he \\nmay  not  pass  through  Bree,  and  so  he  may  not  know  what \\nwe  are  doing.  And  anyway,  unless  by  luck  we  arrive  almost \\ntogether,  we  shall  miss  one  another;  it  will  not  be  safe  for  him \\nor  for  us  to  wait  there  long.  If  the  Riders  fail  to  find  us  in \\nthe  wilderness,  they  are  likely  to  make  for  Weathertop  them¬ \\nselves.  It  commands  a  wide  view  all  round.  Indeed,  there  are \\nmany  birds  and  beasts  in  this  country  that  could  see  us,  as \\nwe  stand  here,  from  that  hill-top.  Not  all  the  birds  are  to  be \\ntrusted,  and  there  are  other  spies  more  evil  than  they  are.’ \\n\\nThe  hobbits  looked  anxiously  at  the  distant  hills.  Sam \\nlooked  up  into  the  pale  sky,  fearing  to  see  hawks  or  eagles \\nhovering  over  them  with  bright  unfriendly  eyes.  ‘You  do \\nmake  me  feel  uncomfortable  and  lonesome,  Strider!’  he  said. \\n\\n‘What  do  you  advise  us  to  do?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘I  think,’  answered  Strider  slowly,  as  if  he  was  not  quite \\nsure,  ‘I  think  the  best  thing  is  to  go  as  straight  eastward  from \\nhere  as  we  can,  to  make  for  the  line  of  hills,  not  for \\nWeathertop.  There  we  can  strike  a  path  I  know  that  runs  at \\ntheir  feet;  it  will  bring  us  to  Weathertop  from  the  north  and \\nless  openly.  Then  we  shall  see  what  we  shall  see.’ \\n\\nAll  that  day  they  plodded  along,  until  the  cold  and  early \\nevening  came  down.  The  land  became  drier  and  more  barren; \\nbut  mists  and  vapours  lay  behind  them  on  the  marshes.  A \\nfew  melancholy  birds  were  piping  and  wailing,  until  the  round \\nred  sun  sank  slowly  into  the  western  shadows;  then  an  empty \\nsilence  fell.  The  hobbits  thought  of  the  soft  light  of  sunset \\nglancing  through  the  cheerful  windows  of  Bag  End  far  away. \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n241 \\n\\n\\nAt  the  day’s  end  they  came  to  a  stream  that  wandered \\ndown  from  the  hills  to  lose  itself  in  the  stagnant  marshland, \\nand  they  went  up  along  its  hanks  while  the  light  lasted.  It  was \\nalready  night  when  at  last  they  halted  and  made  their  camp \\nunder  some  stunted  alder-trees  by  the  shores  of  the  stream. \\nAhead  there  loomed  now  against  the  dusky  sky  the  bleak  and \\ntreeless  backs  of  the  hills.  That  night  they  set  a  watch,  and \\nStrider,  it  seemed,  did  not  sleep  at  all.  The  moon  was  waxing, \\nand  in  the  early  night-hours  a  cold  grey  light  lay  on  the  land. \\n\\nNext  morning  they  set  out  again  soon  after  sunrise.  There \\nwas  a  frost  in  the  air,  and  the  sky  was  a  pale  clear  blue.  The \\nhobbits  felt  refreshed,  as  if  they  had  had  a  night  of  unbroken \\nsleep.  Already  they  were  getting  used  to  much  walking  on \\nshort  commons  -  shorter  at  any  rate  than  what  in  the  Shire \\nthey  would  have  thought  barely  enough  to  keep  them  on  their \\nlegs.  Pippin  declared  that  Frodo  was  looking  twice  the  hobbit \\nthat  he  had  been. \\n\\n‘Very  odd,’  said  Frodo,  tightening  his  belt,  ‘considering \\nthat  there  is  actually  a  good  deal  less  of  me.  I  hope  the \\nthinning  process  will  not  go  on  indefinitely,  or  I  shall  become \\na  wraith.’ \\n\\n‘Do  not  speak  of  such  things!’  said  Strider  quickly,  and \\nwith  surprising  earnestness. \\n\\nThe  hills  drew  nearer.  They  made  an  undulating  ridge, \\noften  rising  almost  to  a  thousand  feet,  and  here  and  there \\nfalling  again  to  low  clefts  or  passes  leading  into  the  eastern \\nland  beyond.  Along  the  crest  of  the  ridge  the  hobbits  could \\nsee  what  looked  to  be  the  remains  of  green-grown  walls  and \\ndikes,  and  in  the  clefts  there  still  stood  the  ruins  of  old  works \\nof  stone.  By  night  they  had  reached  the  feet  of  the  westward \\nslopes,  and  there  they  camped.  It  was  the  night  of  the  fifth \\nof  October,  and  they  were  six  days  out  from  Bree. \\n\\nIn  the  morning  they  found,  for  the  first  time  since  they  had \\nleft  the  Chetwood,  a  track  plain  to  see.  They  turned  right \\nand  followed  it  southwards.  It  ran  cunningly,  taking  a  line \\nthat  seemed  chosen  so  as  to  keep  as  much  hidden  as  possible \\n\\n\\n242  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nfrom  the  view,  both  of  the  hill-tops  above  and  of  the  flats  to \\nthe  west.  It  dived  into  dells,  and  hugged  steep  banks;  and \\nwhere  it  passed  over  flatter  and  more  open  ground  on  either \\nside  of  it  there  were  lines  of  large  boulders  and  hewn  stones \\nthat  screened  the  travellers  almost  like  a  hedge. \\n\\n‘I  wonder  who  made  this  path,  and  what  for,’  said  Merry, \\nas  they  walked  along  one  of  these  avenues,  where  the  stones \\nwere  unusually  large  and  closely  set.  ‘I  am  not  sure  that  I  like \\nit:  it  has  a  -  well,  rather  a  barrow-wightish  look.  Is  there  any \\nbarrow  on  Weathertop?’ \\n\\n‘No.  There  is  no  barrow  on  Weathertop,  nor  on  any  of \\nthese  hills,’  answered  Strider.  ‘The  Men  of  the  West  did  not \\nlive  here;  though  in  their  latter  days  they  defended  the  hills \\nfor  a  while  against  the  evil  that  came  out  of  Angmar.  This \\npath  was  made  to  serve  the  forts  along  the  walls.  But  long \\nbefore,  in  the  first  days  of  the  North  Kingdom,  they  built  a \\ngreat  watch-tower  on  Weathertop,  Amon  Sul  they  called  it. \\nIt  was  burned  and  broken,  and  nothing  remains  of  it  now  but \\na  tumbled  ring,  like  a  rough  crown  on  the  old  hill’s  head.  Yet \\nonce  it  was  tall  and  fair.  It  is  told  that  Elendil  stood  there \\nwatching  for  the  coming  of  Gil-galad  out  of  the  West,  in  the \\ndays  of  the  Last  Alliance.’ \\n\\nThe  hobbits  gazed  at  Strider.  It  seemed  that  he  was  learned \\nin  old  lore,  as  well  as  in  the  ways  of  the  wild.  ‘Who  was \\nGil-galad?’  asked  Merry;  but  Strider  did  not  answer,  and \\nseemed  to  be  lost  in  thought.  Suddenly  a  low  voice \\nmurmured: \\n\\n\\nGil-galad  was  an  Elven-king. \\n\\nOf  him  the  harpers  sadly  sing: \\nthe  last  whose  realm  was  fair  and  free \\nbetween  the  Mountains  and  the  Sea. \\n\\nHis  sword  was  long,  his  lance  was  keen, \\nhis  shining  helm  afar  was  seen; \\nthe  countless  stars  of  heaven’s  field \\nwere  mirrored  in  his  silver  shield. \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n243 \\n\\n\\nBut  long  ago  he  rode  away, \\nand  where  he  dwelleth  none  can  say; \\nfor  into  darkness  fell  his  star \\nin  Mordor  where  the  shadows  are. \\n\\nThe  others  turned  in  amazement,  for  the  voice  was  Sam’s. \\n\\n‘Don’t  stop!’  said  Merry. \\n\\n‘That’s  all  I  know,’  stammered  Sam,  blushing.  ‘I  learned  it \\nfrom  Mr.  Bilbo  when  I  was  a  lad.  He  used  to  tell  me  tales \\nlike  that,  knowing  how  I  was  always  one  for  hearing  about \\nElves.  It  was  Mr.  Bilbo  as  taught  me  my  letters.  He  was \\nmighty  book-learned  was  dear  old  Mr.  Bilbo.  And  he  wrote \\npoetry.  He  wrote  what  I  have  just  said.’ \\n\\n‘He  did  not  make  it  up,’  said  Strider.  ‘It  is  part  of  the  lay \\nthat  is  called  The  Fall  of  Gil-galad,  which  is  in  an  ancient \\ntongue.  Bilbo  must  have  translated  it.  I  never  knew  that.’ \\n\\n‘There  was  a  lot  more,’  said  Sam,  ‘all  about  Mordor.  I \\ndidn’t  learn  that  part,  it  gave  me  the  shivers.  I  never  thought \\nI  should  be  going  that  way  myself!’ \\n\\n‘Going  to  Mordor!’  cried  Pippin.  ‘I  hope  it  won’t  come  to \\nthat!’ \\n\\n‘Do  not  speak  that  name  so  loudly!’  said  Strider. \\n\\nIt  was  already  mid-day  when  they  drew  near  the  southern \\nend  of  the  path,  and  saw  before  them,  in  the  pale  clear  light \\nof  the  October  sun,  a  grey-green  bank,  leading  up  like  a \\nbridge  on  to  the  northward  slope  of  the  hill.  They  decided \\nto  make  for  the  top  at  once,  while  the  daylight  was  broad. \\nConcealment  was  no  longer  possible,  and  they  could  only \\nhope  that  no  enemy  or  spy  was  observing  them.  Nothing  was \\nto  be  seen  moving  on  the  hill.  If  Gandalf  was  anywhere  about, \\nthere  was  no  sign  of  him. \\n\\nOn  the  western  flank  of  Weathertop  they  found  a  sheltered \\nhollow,  at  the  bottom  of  which  there  was  a  bowl-shaped  dell \\nwith  grassy  sides.  There  they  left  Sam  and  Pippin  with  the \\npony  and  their  packs  and  luggage.  The  other  three  went  on. \\nAfter  half  an  hour’s  plodding  climb  Strider  reached  the  crown \\n\\n\\n244 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nof  the  hill;  Frodo  and  Merry  followed,  tired  and  breathless. \\nThe  last  slope  had  been  steep  and  rocky. \\n\\nOn  the  top  they  found,  as  Strider  had  said,  a  wide  ring  of \\nancient  stone -work,  now  crumbling  or  covered  with  age-long \\ngrass.  But  in  the  centre  a  cairn  of  broken  stones  had  been \\npiled.  They  were  blackened  as  if  with  fire.  About  them  the \\nturf  was  burned  to  the  roots  and  all  within  the  ring  the  grass \\nwas  scorched  and  shrivelled,  as  if  flames  had  swept  the  hill¬ \\ntop;  but  there  was  no  sign  of  any  living  thing. \\n\\nStanding  upon  the  rim  of  the  ruined  circle,  they  saw  all \\nround  below  them  a  wide  prospect,  for  the  most  part  of  lands \\nempty  and  featureless,  except  for  patches  of  woodland  away \\nto  the  south,  beyond  which  they  caught  here  and  there  the \\nglint  of  distant  water.  Beneath  them  on  this  southern  side \\nthere  ran  like  a  ribbon  the  Old  Road,  coming  out  of  the  West \\nand  winding  up  and  down,  until  it  faded  behind  a  ridge  of \\ndark  land  to  the  east.  Nothing  was  moving  on  it.  Following \\nits  line  eastward  with  their  eyes  they  saw  the  Mountains:  the \\nnearer  foothills  were  brown  and  sombre;  behind  them  stood \\ntaller  shapes  of  grey,  and  behind  those  again  were  high  white \\npeaks  glimmering  among  the  clouds. \\n\\nWell,  here  we  are!’  said  Merry.  ‘And  very  cheerless  and \\nuninviting  it  looks!  There  is  no  water  and  no  shelter.  And  no \\nsign  of  Gandalf.  But  I  don’t  blame  him  for  not  waiting  -  if \\nhe  ever  came  here.’ \\n\\n‘I  wonder,’  said  Strider,  looking  round  thoughtfully.  ‘Even \\nif  he  was  a  day  or  two  behind  us  at  Bree,  he  could  have \\narrived  here  first.  He  can  ride  very  swiftly  when  need  presses.’ \\nSuddenly  he  stooped  and  looked  at  the  stone  on  the  top  of \\nthe  cairn;  it  was  flatter  than  the  others,  and  whiter,  as  if  it \\nhad  escaped  the  fire.  He  picked  it  up  and  examined  it,  turning \\nit  in  his  fingers.  ‘This  has  been  handled  recently,’  he  said. \\n‘What  do  you  think  of  these  marks?’ \\n\\nOn  the  flat  under-side  Frodo  saw  some  scratches:  I*- III \\n‘There  seems  to  be  a  stroke,  a  dot,  and  three  more  strokes,’ \\nhe  said. \\n\\n‘The  stroke  on  the  left  might  be  a  G-rune  with  thin \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n245 \\n\\n\\nbranches,’  said  Strider.  ‘It  might  be  a  sign  left  by  Gandalf, \\nthough  one  cannot  be  sure.  The  scratches  are  fine,  and  they \\ncertainly  look  fresh.  But  the  marks  might  mean  something \\nquite  different,  and  have  nothing  to  do  with  us.  Rangers  use \\nrunes,  and  they  come  here  sometimes.’ \\n\\n‘What  could  they  mean,  even  if  Gandalf  made  them?’ \\nasked  Merry. \\n\\n‘I  should  say,’  answered  Strider,  ‘that  they  stood  for  G3, \\nand  were  a  sign  that  Gandalf  was  here  on  October  the  third: \\nthat  is  three  days  ago  now.  It  would  also  show  that  he  was  in \\na  hurry  and  danger  was  at  hand,  so  that  he  had  no  time  or \\ndid  not  dare  to  write  anything  longer  or  plainer.  If  that  is  so, \\nwe  must  be  wary.’ \\n\\n‘I  wish  we  could  feel  sure  that  he  made  the  marks,  whatever \\nthey  may  mean,’  said  Frodo.  ‘It  would  be  a  great  comfort  to \\nknow  that  he  was  on  the  way,  in  front  of  us  or  behind  us.’ \\n\\n‘Perhaps,’  said  Strider.  ‘For  myself,  I  believe  that  he  was \\nhere,  and  was  in  danger.  There  have  been  scorching  flames \\nhere;  and  now  the  light  that  we  saw  three  nights  ago  in  the \\neastern  sky  comes  back  to  my  mind.  I  guess  that  he  was \\nattacked  on  this  hill-top,  but  with  what  result  I  cannot  tell. \\nHe  is  here  no  longer,  and  we  must  now  look  after  ourselves \\nand  make  our  own  way  to  Rivendell,  as  best  we  can.’ \\n\\n‘How  far  is  Rivendell?’  asked  Merry,  gazing  round  wearily. \\nThe  world  looked  wild  and  wide  from  Weathertop. \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know  if  the  Road  has  ever  been  measured  in  miles \\nbeyond  the  Forsaken  Inn ,  a  day’s  journey  east  of  Bree,’ \\nanswered  Strider.  ‘Some  say  it  is  so  far,  and  some  say  other¬ \\nwise.  It  is  a  strange  road,  and  folk  are  glad  to  reach  their \\njourney’s  end,  whether  the  time  is  long  or  short.  But  I  know \\nhow  long  it  would  take  me  on  my  own  feet,  with  fair  weather \\nand  no  ill  fortune:  twelve  days  from  here  to  the  Ford  of \\nBruinen,  where  the  Road  crosses  the  Loudwater  that  runs \\nout  of  Rivendell.  We  have  at  least  a  fortnight’s  journey  before \\nus,  for  I  do  not  think  we  shall  be  able  to  use  the  Road.’ \\n\\n‘A  fortnight!’  said  Frodo.  ‘A  lot  may  happen  in  that  time.’ \\n\\n‘It  may,’  said  Strider. \\n\\n\\n246  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nThey  stood  for  a  while  silent  on  the  hill-top,  near  its  south¬ \\nward  edge.  In  that  lonely  place  Frodo  for  the  first  time  fully \\nrealized  his  homelessness  and  danger.  He  wished  bitterly  that \\nhis  fortune  had  left  him  in  the  quiet  and  beloved  Shire.  He \\nstared  down  at  the  hateful  Road,  leading  back  westward  -  to \\nhis  home.  Suddenly  he  was  aware  that  two  black  specks  were \\nmoving  slowly  along  it,  going  westward;  and  looking  again \\nhe  saw  that  three  others  were  creeping  eastward  to  meet \\nthem.  He  gave  a  cry  and  clutched  Strider’s  arm. \\n\\n‘Look,’  he  said,  pointing  downwards. \\n\\nAt  once  Strider  flung  himself  on  the  ground  behind  the \\nruined  circle,  pulling  Frodo  down  beside  him.  Merry  threw \\nhimself  alongside. \\n\\n‘What  is  it?’  he  whispered. \\n\\n‘I  do  not  know,  but  I  fear  the  worst,’  answered  Strider. \\n\\nSlowly  they  crawled  up  to  the  edge  of  the  ring  again,  and \\npeered  through  a  cleft  between  two  jagged  stones.  The  light \\nwas  no  longer  bright,  for  the  clear  morning  had  faded,  and \\nclouds  creeping  out  of  the  East  had  now  overtaken  the  sun, \\nas  it  began  to  go  down.  They  could  all  see  the  black  specks, \\nbut  neither  Frodo  nor  Merry  could  make  out  their  shapes  for \\ncertain;  yet  something  told  them  that  there,  far  below,  were \\nBlack  Riders  assembling  on  the  Road  beyond  the  foot  of  the \\nhill. \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  Strider,  whose  keener  sight  left  him  in  no  doubt. \\n‘The  enemy  is  here!’ \\n\\nHastily  they  crept  away  and  slipped  down  the  north  side \\nof  the  hill  to  find  their  companions. \\n\\nSam  and  Peregrin  had  not  been  idle.  They  had  explored \\nthe  small  dell  and  the  surrounding  slopes.  Not  far  away  they \\nfound  a  spring  of  clear  water  in  the  hillside,  and  near  it \\nfootprints  not  more  than  a  day  or  two  old.  In  the  dell  itself \\nthey  found  recent  traces  of  a  fire,  and  other  signs  of  a  hasty \\ncamp.  There  were  some  fallen  rocks  on  the  edge  of  the  dell \\nnearest  to  the  hill.  Behind  them  Sam  came  upon  a  small  store \\nof  firewood  neatly  stacked. \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n247 \\n\\n\\n‘I  wonder  if  old  Gandalf  has  been  here,’  he  said  to  Pippin. \\n‘Whoever  it  was  put  this  stuff  here  meant  to  come  back  it \\nseems.’ \\n\\nStrider  was  greatly  interested  in  these  discoveries.  ‘I  wish  I \\nhad  waited  and  explored  the  ground  down  here  myself,’  he \\nsaid,  hurrying  off  to  the  spring  to  examine  the  footprints. \\n\\n‘It  is  just  as  I  feared,’  he  said,  when  he  came  back.  ‘Sam \\nand  Pippin  have  trampled  the  soft  ground,  and  the  marks  are \\nspoilt  or  confused.  Rangers  have  been  here  lately.  It  is  they \\nwho  left  the  firewood  behind.  But  there  are  also  several  newer \\ntracks  that  were  not  made  by  Rangers.  At  least  one  set  was \\nmade,  only  a  day  or  two  ago,  by  heavy  boots.  At  least  one.  I \\ncannot  now  be  certain,  but  I  think  there  were  many  booted \\nfeet.’  He  paused  and  stood  in  anxious  thought. \\n\\nEach  of  the  hobbits  saw  in  his  mind  a  vision  of  the  cloaked \\nand  booted  Riders.  If  the  horsemen  had  already  found  the  dell, \\nthe  sooner  Strider  led  them  somewhere  else  the  better.  Sam \\nviewed  the  hollow  with  great  dislike,  now  that  he  had  heard \\nnews  of  their  enemies  on  the  Road,  only  a  few  miles  away. \\n\\n‘Hadn’t  we  better  clear  out  quick,  Mr.  Strider?’  he  asked \\nimpatiently.  ‘It  is  getting  late,  and  I  don’t  like  this  hole:  it \\nmakes  my  heart  sink  somehow.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  we  certainly  must  decide  what  to  do  at  once,’ \\nanswered  Strider,  looking  up  and  considering  the  time  and \\nthe  weather.  ‘Well,  Sam,’  he  said  at  last,  ‘I  do  not  like  this \\nplace  either;  but  I  cannot  think  of  anywhere  better  that  we \\ncould  reach  before  nightfall.  At  least  we  are  out  of  sight  for \\nthe  moment,  and  if  we  moved  we  should  be  much  more  likely \\nto  be  seen  by  spies.  All  we  could  do  would  be  to  go  right  out \\nof  our  way  back  north  on  this  side  of  the  line  of  hills,  where \\nthe  land  is  all  much  the  same  as  it  is  here.  The  Road  is \\nwatched,  but  we  should  have  to  cross  it,  if  we  tried  to  take \\ncover  in  the  thickets  away  to  the  south.  On  the  north  side  of \\nthe  Road  beyond  the  hills  the  country  is  bare  and  flat  for \\nmiles.’ \\n\\n‘Can  the  Riders  see ?’  asked  Merry.  ‘I  mean,  they  seem \\nusually  to  have  used  their  noses  rather  than  their  eyes, \\n\\n\\n248 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nsmelling  for  us,  if  smelling  is  the  right  word,  at  least  in  the \\ndaylight.  But  you  made  us  lie  down  flat  when  you  saw  them \\ndown  below;  and  now  you  talk  of  being  seen,  if  we  move.’ \\n\\n‘I  was  too  careless  on  the  hill-top,’  answered  Strider.  ‘I  was \\nvery  anxious  to  find  some  sign  of  Gandalf;  but  it  was  a \\nmistake  for  three  of  us  to  go  up  and  stand  there  so  long.  For \\nthe  black  horses  can  see,  and  the  Riders  can  use  men  and \\nother  creatures  as  spies,  as  we  found  at  Bree.  They  themselves \\ndo  not  see  the  world  of  light  as  we  do,  but  our  shapes  cast \\nshadows  in  their  minds,  which  only  the  noon  sun  destroys; \\nand  in  the  dark  they  perceive  many  signs  and  forms  that  are \\nhidden  from  us:  then  they  are  most  to  be  feared.  And  at  all \\ntimes  they  smell  the  blood  of  living  things,  desiring  and  hating \\nit.  Senses,  too,  there  are  other  than  sight  or  smell.  We  can \\nfeel  their  presence  -  it  troubled  our  hearts,  as  soon  as  we \\ncame  here,  and  before  we  saw  them;  they  feel  ours  more \\nkeenly.  Also,’  he  added,  and  his  voice  sank  to  a  whisper,  ‘the \\nRing  draws  them.’ \\n\\n‘Is  there  no  escape  then?’  said  Frodo,  looking  round  wildly. \\n‘If  I  move  I  shall  be  seen  and  hunted!  If  I  stay,  I  shall  draw \\nthem  to  me!’ \\n\\nStrider  laid  his  hand  on  his  shoulder.  ‘There  is  still  hope,’  he \\nsaid.  ‘You  are  not  alone.  Let  us  take  this  wood  that  is  set  ready \\nfor  the  fire  as  a  sign.  There  is  little  shelter  or  defence  here,  but \\nfire  shall  serve  for  both.  Sauron  can  put  fire  to  his  evil  uses,  as \\nhe  can  all  things,  but  these  Riders  do  not  love  it,  and  fear  those \\nwho  wield  it.  Fire  is  our  friend  in  the  wilderness.’ \\n\\n‘Maybe,’  muttered  Sam.  ‘It  is  also  as  good  a  way  of  saying \\n“here  we  are”  as  I  can  think  of,  bar  shouting.’ \\n\\nDown  in  the  lowest  and  most  sheltered  corner  of  the  dell \\nthey  lit  a  fire,  and  prepared  a  meal.  The  shades  of  evening \\nbegan  to  fall,  and  it  grew  cold.  They  were  suddenly  aware \\nof  great  hunger,  for  they  had  not  eaten  anything  since  break¬ \\nfast;  but  they  dared  not  make  more  than  a  frugal  supper. \\nThe  lands  ahead  were  empty  of  all  save  birds  and  beasts, \\nunfriendly  places  deserted  by  all  the  races  of  the  world. \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n249 \\n\\n\\nRangers  passed  at  times  beyond  the  hills,  but  they  were  few \\nand  did  not  stay.  Other  wanderers  were  rare,  and  of  evil  sort: \\ntrolls  might  stray  down  at  times  out  of  the  northern  valleys \\nof  the  Misty  Mountains.  Only  on  the  Road  would  travellers \\nbe  found,  most  often  dwarves,  hurrying  along  on  business  of \\ntheir  own,  and  with  no  help  and  few  words  to  spare  for \\nstrangers. \\n\\n‘I  don’t  see  how  our  food  can  be  made  to  last,’  said  Frodo. \\n‘We  have  been  careful  enough  in  the  last  few  days,  and  this \\nsupper  is  no  feast;  but  we  have  used  more  than  we  ought,  if \\nwe  have  two  weeks  still  to  go,  and  perhaps  more.’ \\n\\n‘There  is  food  in  the  wild,’  said  Strider;  ‘berry,  root,  and \\nherb;  and  I  have  some  skill  as  a  hunter  at  need.  You  need  not \\nbe  afraid  of  starving  before  winter  comes.  But  gathering  and \\ncatching  food  is  long  and  weary  work,  and  we  need  haste.  So \\ntighten  your  belts,  and  think  with  hope  of  the  tables  of \\nElrond’s  house!’ \\n\\nThe  cold  increased  as  darkness  came  on.  Peering  out  from \\nthe  edge  of  the  dell  they  could  see  nothing  but  a  grey  land \\nnow  vanishing  quickly  into  shadow.  The  sky  above  had \\ncleared  again  and  was  slowly  filled  with  twinkling  stars.  Frodo \\nand  his  companions  huddled  round  the  fire,  wrapped  in  every \\ngarment  and  blanket  they  possessed;  but  Strider  was  content \\nwith  a  single  cloak,  and  sat  a  little  apart,  drawing  thoughtfully \\nat  his  pipe. \\n\\nAs  night  fell  and  the  light  of  the  fire  began  to  shine  out \\nbrightly  he  began  to  tell  them  tales  to  keep  their  minds  from \\nfear.  He  knew  many  histories  and  legends  of  long  ago,  of \\nElves  and  Men  and  the  good  and  evil  deeds  of  the  Elder \\nDays.  They  wondered  how  old  he  was,  and  where  he  had \\nlearned  all  this  lore. \\n\\n‘Tell  us  of  Gil-galad,’  said  Merry  suddenly,  when  he \\npaused  at  the  end  of  a  story  of  the  Elf-kingdoms.  ‘Do  you \\nknow  any  more  of  that  old  lay  that  you  spoke  of?’ \\n\\n‘I  do  indeed,’  answered  Strider.  ‘So  also  does  Frodo,  for  it \\nconcerns  us  closely.’  Merry  and  Pippin  looked  at  Frodo,  who \\nwas  staring  into  the  fire. \\n\\n\\n250 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘I  know  only  the  little  that  Gandalf  has  told  me,’  said  Frodo \\nslowly.  ‘Gil-galad  was  the  last  of  the  great  Elf-kings  of \\nMiddle-earth.  Gil-galad  is  Starlight  in  their  tongue.  With \\nElendil,  the  Elf-friend,  he  went  to  the  land  of - ’ \\n\\n‘No!’  said  Strider  interrupting,  ‘I  do  not  think  that  tale \\nshould  be  told  now  with  the  servants  of  the  Enemy  at  hand. \\nIf  we  win  through  to  the  house  of  Elrond,  you  may  hear  it \\nthere,  told  in  full.’ \\n\\n‘Then  tell  us  some  other  tale  of  the  old  days,’  begged  Sam; \\n‘a  tale  about  the  Elves  before  the  fading  time.  I  would  dearly \\nlike  to  hear  more  about  Elves;  the  dark  seems  to  press  round \\nso  close.’ \\n\\n‘I  will  tell  you  the  tale  of  Tinuviel,’  said  Strider,  ‘in  brief - \\nfor  it  is  a  long  tale  of  which  the  end  is  not  known;  and  there \\nare  none  now,  except  Elrond,  that  remember  it  aright  as  it \\nwas  told  of  old.  It  is  a  fair  tale,  though  it  is  sad,  as  are  all  the \\ntales  of  Middle-earth,  and  yet  it  may  lift  up  your  hearts.’  He \\nwas  silent  for  some  time,  and  then  he  began  not  to  speak  but \\nto  chant  softly: \\n\\nThe  leaves  were  long,  the  grass  was  green, \\n\\nThe  hemlock-umbels  tall  and  fair, \\n\\nAnd  in  the  glade  a  light  was  seen \\nOf  stars  in  shadow  shimmering. \\n\\nTinuviel  was  dancing  there \\nTo  music  of  a  pipe  unseen, \\n\\nAnd  light  of  stars  was  in  her  hair, \\n\\nAnd  in  her  raiment  glimmering. \\n\\nThere  Beren  came  from  mountains  cold, \\n\\nAnd  lost  he  wandered  under  leaves, \\n\\nAnd  where  the  Elven-river  rolled \\nHe  walked  alone  and  sorrowing. \\n\\nHe  peered  between  the  hemlock-leaves \\nAnd  saw  in  wonder  flowers  of  gold \\nUpon  her  mantle  and  her  sleeves, \\n\\nAnd  her  hair  like  shadow  following. \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n251 \\n\\n\\nEnchantment  healed  his  weary  feet \\nThat  over  hills  were  doomed  to  roam; \\nAnd  forth  he  hastened,  strong  and  fleet, \\n\\nAnd  grasped  at  moonbeams  glistening. \\nThrough  woven  woods  in  Elvenhome \\nShe  lightly  fled  on  dancing  feet, \\n\\nAnd  left  him  lonely  still  to  roam \\nIn  the  silent  forest  listening. \\n\\nHe  heard  there  oft  the  flying  sound \\nOf  feet  as  light  as  linden-leaves, \\n\\nOr  music  welling  underground, \\n\\nIn  hidden  hollows  quavering. \\n\\nNow  withered  lay  the  hemlock-sheaves, \\n\\nAnd  one  by  one  with  sighing  sound \\nWhispering  fell  the  beechen  leaves \\nIn  the  wintry  woodland  wavering. \\n\\nHe  sought  her  ever,  wandering  far \\n\\nWhere  leaves  of  years  were  thickly  strewn. \\nBy  light  of  moon  and  ray  of  star \\nIn  frosty  heavens  shivering. \\n\\nHer  mantle  glinted  in  the  moon, \\n\\nAs  on  a  hill-top  high  and  far \\nShe  danced,  and  at  her  feet  was  strewn \\nA  mist  of  silver  quivering. \\n\\nWhen  winter  passed,  she  came  again, \\n\\nAnd  her  song  released  the  sudden  spring, \\nLike  rising  lark,  and  falling  rain, \\n\\nAnd  melting  water  bubbling. \\n\\nHe  saw  the  elven-flowers  spring \\nAbout  her  feet,  and  healed  again \\nHe  longed  by  her  to  dance  and  sing \\nUpon  the  grass  untroubling. \\n\\n\\n252 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nAgain  she  fled,  but  swift  he  came. \\n\\nTiniwiel!  Tiniwiel! \\n\\nHe  called  her  by  her  Elvish  name; \\n\\nAnd  there  she  halted  listening. \\n\\nOne  moment  stood  she,  and  a  spell \\nHis  voice  laid  on  her:  Beren  came, \\n\\nAnd  doom  fell  on  Tiniwiel \\n\\nThat  in  his  arms  lay  glistening. \\n\\nAs  Beren  looked  into  her  eyes \\nWithin  the  shadows  of  her  hair, \\n\\nThe  trembling  starlight  of  the  skies \\nHe  saw  there  mirrored  shimmering. \\n\\nTiniwiel  the  elven-fair, \\n\\nImmortal  maiden  elven-wise, \\n\\nAbout  him  cast  her  shadowy  hair \\nAnd  arms  like  silver  glimmering. \\n\\nLong  was  the  way  that  fate  them  bore, \\n\\nO’er  stony  mountains  cold  and  grey, \\n\\nThrough  halls  of  iron  and  darkling  door. \\n\\nAnd  woods  of  nightshade  morrowless. \\n\\nThe  Sundering  Seas  between  them  lay, \\n\\nAnd  yet  at  last  they  met  once  more, \\n\\nAnd  long  ago  they  passed  away \\nIn  the  forest  singing  sorrowless. \\n\\nStrider  sighed  and  paused  before  he  spoke  again.  ‘That  is \\na  song,’  he  said,  ‘in  the  mode  that  is  called  ann-thennath \\namong  the  Elves,  but  is  hard  to  render  in  our  Common \\nSpeech,  and  this  is  but  a  rough  echo  of  it.  It  tells  of  the \\nmeeting  of  Beren  son  of  Barahir  and  Luthien  Timiviel.  Beren \\nwas  a  mortal  man,  but  Luthien  was  the  daughter  of  Thingol, \\na  King  of  Elves  upon  Middle-earth  when  the  world  was \\nyoung;  and  she  was  the  fairest  maiden  that  has  ever  been \\namong  all  the  children  of  this  world.  As  the  stars  above  the \\nmists  of  the  Northern  lands  was  her  loveliness,  and  in  her \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n253 \\n\\n\\nface  was  a  shining  light.  In  those  days  the  Great  Enemy, \\nof  whom  Sauron  of  Mordor  was  but  a  servant,  dwelt  in \\nAngband  in  the  North,  and  the  Elves  of  the  West  coming \\nback  to  Middle-earth  made  war  upon  him  to  regain  the \\nSilmarils  which  he  had  stolen;  and  the  fathers  of  Men  aided \\nthe  Elves.  But  the  Enemy  was  victorious  and  Barahir  was \\nslain,  and  Beren  escaping  through  great  peril  came  over  the \\nMountains  of  Terror  into  the  hidden  Kingdom  of  Thingol  in \\nthe  forest  of  Neldoreth.  There  he  beheld  Luthien  singing  and \\ndancing  in  a  glade  beside  the  enchanted  river  Esgalduin;  and \\nhe  named  her  Tinuviel,  that  is  Nightingale  in  the  language \\nof  old.  Many  sorrows  befell  them  afterwards,  and  they  were \\nparted  long.  Tinuviel  rescued  Beren  from  the  dungeons  of \\nSauron,  and  together  they  passed  through  great  dangers,  and \\ncast  down  even  the  Great  Enemy  from  his  throne,  and  took \\nfrom  his  iron  crown  one  of  the  three  Silmarils,  brightest  of \\nall  jewels,  to  be  the  bride-price  of  Luthien  to  Thingol  her \\nfather.  Yet  at  the  last  Beren  was  slain  by  the  Wolf  that  came \\nfrom  the  gates  of  Angband,  and  he  died  in  the  arms  of \\nTinuviel.  But  she  chose  mortality,  and  to  die  from  the  world, \\nso  that  she  might  follow  him;  and  it  is  sung  that  they  met \\nagain  beyond  the  Sundering  Seas,  and  after  a  brief  time  walk¬ \\ning  alive  once  more  in  the  green  woods,  together  they  passed, \\nlong  ago,  beyond  the  confines  of  this  world.  So  it  is  that \\nLuthien  Tinuviel  alone  of  the  Elf-kindred  has  died  indeed \\nand  left  the  world,  and  they  have  lost  her  whom  they  most \\nloved.  But  from  her  the  lineage  of  the  Elf-lords  of  old \\ndescended  among  Men.  There  live  still  those  of  whom \\nLuthien  was  the  foremother,  and  it  is  said  that  her  line  shall \\nnever  fail.  Elrond  of  Rivendell  is  of  that  Kin.  For  of  Beren \\nand  Luthien  was  born  Dior  Thingol’s  heir;  and  of  him  Elwing \\nthe  White  whom  Earendil  wedded,  he  that  sailed  his  ship  out \\nof  the  mists  of  the  world  into  the  seas  of  heaven  with  the \\nSilmaril  upon  his  brow.  And  of  Earendil  came  the  Kings  of \\nNumenor,  that  is  Westernesse.’ \\n\\nAs  Strider  was  speaking  they  watched  his  strange  eager \\nface,  dimly  lit  in  the  red  glow  of  the  wood-fire.  His  eyes \\n\\n\\n254 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nshone,  and  his  voice  was  rich  and  deep.  Above  him  was  a \\nblack  starry  sky.  Suddenly  a  pale  light  appeared  over  the \\ncrown  of  Weathertop  behind  him.  The  waxing  moon  was \\nclimbing  slowly  above  the  hill  that  overshadowed  them,  and \\nthe  stars  above  the  hill-top  faded. \\n\\nThe  story  ended.  The  hobbits  moved  and  stretched. \\n‘Look!’  said  Merry.  ‘The  Moon  is  rising:  it  must  be  getting \\nlate.’ \\n\\nThe  others  looked  up.  Even  as  they  did  so,  they  saw  on \\nthe  top  of  the  hill  something  small  and  dark  against  the  glim¬ \\nmer  of  the  moonrise.  It  was  perhaps  only  a  large  stone  or \\njutting  rock  shown  up  by  the  pale  light. \\n\\nSam  and  Merry  got  up  and  walked  away  from  the  fire. \\nFrodo  and  Pippin  remained  seated  in  silence.  Strider  was \\nwatching  the  moonlight  on  the  hill  intently.  All  seemed  quiet \\nand  still,  but  Frodo  felt  a  cold  dread  creeping  over  his  heart, \\nnow  that  Strider  was  no  longer  speaking.  He  huddled  closer \\nto  the  fire.  At  that  moment  Sam  came  running  back  from  the \\nedge  of  the  dell. \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know  what  it  is,’  he  said,  ‘but  I  suddenly  felt  afraid. \\nI  durstn’t  go  outside  this  dell  for  any  money;  I  felt  that  some¬ \\nthing  was  creeping  up  the  slope.’ \\n\\n‘Did  you  see  anything?’  asked  Frodo,  springing  to  his  feet. \\n\\n‘No,  sir.  I  saw  nothing,  but  I  didn’t  stop  to  look.’ \\n\\n‘I  saw  something,’  said  Merry;  ‘or  I  thought  I  did  -  away \\nwestwards  where  the  moonlight  was  falling  on  the  flats \\nbeyond  the  shadow  of  the  hill-tops,  I  thought  there  were  two \\nor  three  black  shapes.  They  seemed  to  be  moving  this  way.’ \\n\\n‘Keep  close  to  the  fire,  with  your  faces  outward!’  cried \\nStrider.  ‘Get  some  of  the  longer  sticks  ready  in  your  hands!’ \\n\\nFor  a  breathless  time  they  sat  there,  silent  and  alert,  with \\ntheir  backs  turned  to  the  wood-fire,  each  gazing  into  the \\nshadows  that  encircled  them.  Nothing  happened.  There  was \\nno  sound  or  movement  in  the  night.  Frodo  stirred,  feeling \\nthat  he  must  break  the  silence:  he  longed  to  shout  out  aloud. \\n\\n‘Hush!’  whispered  Strider.  ‘What’s  that?’  gasped  Pippin  at \\nthe  same  moment. \\n\\n\\nA  KNIFE  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n255 \\n\\n\\nOver  the  lip  of  the  little  dell,  on  the  side  away  from  the \\nhill,  they  felt,  rather  than  saw,  a  shadow  rise,  one  shadow  or \\nmore  than  one.  They  strained  their  eyes,  and  the  shadows \\nseemed  to  grow.  Soon  there  could  be  no  doubt:  three  or  four \\ntall  black  figures  were  standing  there  on  the  slope,  looking \\ndown  on  them.  So  black  were  they  that  they  seemed  like \\nblack  holes  in  the  deep  shade  behind  them.  Frodo  thought \\nthat  he  heard  a  faint  hiss  as  of  venomous  breath  and  felt  a \\nthin  piercing  chill.  Then  the  shapes  slowly  advanced. \\n\\nTerror  overcame  Pippin  and  Merry,  and  they  threw  them¬ \\nselves  flat  on  the  ground.  Sam  shrank  to  Frodo’s  side.  Frodo \\nwas  hardly  less  terrified  than  his  companions;  he  was  quaking \\nas  if  he  was  bitter  cold,  but  his  terror  was  swallowed  up  in  a \\nsudden  temptation  to  put  on  the  Ring.  The  desire  to  do  this \\nlaid  hold  of  him,  and  he  could  think  of  nothing  else.  He \\ndid  not  forget  the  Barrow,  nor  the  message  of  Gandalf; \\nbut  something  seemed  to  be  compelling  him  to  disregard \\nall  warnings,  and  he  longed  to  yield.  Not  with  the  hope  of \\nescape,  or  of  doing  anything,  either  good  or  bad:  he  simply \\nfelt  that  he  must  take  the  Ring  and  put  it  on  his  finger.  He \\ncould  not  speak.  He  felt  Sam  looking  at  him,  as  if  he  knew \\nthat  his  master  was  in  some  great  trouble,  but  he  could  not \\nturn  towards  him.  He  shut  his  eyes  and  struggled  for  a  while; \\nbut  resistance  became  unbearable,  and  at  last  he  slowly  drew \\nout  the  chain,  and  slipped  the  Ring  on  the  forefinger  of  his \\nleft  hand. \\n\\nImmediately,  though  everything  else  remained  as  before, \\ndim  and  dark,  the  shapes  became  terribly  clear.  He  was  able \\nto  see  beneath  their  black  wrappings.  There  were  five  tall \\nfigures:  two  standing  on  the  lip  of  the  dell,  three  advancing. \\nIn  their  white  faces  burned  keen  and  merciless  eyes;  under \\ntheir  mantles  were  long  grey  robes;  upon  their  grey  hairs  were \\nhelms  of  silver;  in  their  haggard  hands  were  swords  of  steel. \\nTheir  eyes  fell  on  him  and  pierced  him,  as  they  rushed \\ntowards  him.  Desperate,  he  drew  his  own  sword,  and  it \\nseemed  to  him  that  it  flickered  red,  as  if  it  was  a  firebrand. \\nTwo  of  the  figures  halted.  The  third  was  taller  than  the  others: \\n\\n\\n256 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nhis  hair  was  long  and  gleaming  and  on  his  helm  was  a  crown. \\nIn  one  hand  he  held  a  long  sword,  and  in  the  other  a  knife; \\nboth  the  knife  and  the  hand  that  held  it  glowed  with  a  pale \\nlight.  He  sprang  forward  and  bore  down  on  Frodo. \\n\\nAt  that  moment  Frodo  threw  himself  forward  on  the \\nground,  and  he  heard  himself  crying  aloud:  O  Elbereth! \\nGilthoniel!  At  the  same  time  he  struck  at  the  feet  of  his  enemy. \\nA  shrill  cry  rang  out  in  the  night;  and  he  felt  a  pain  like  a  dart \\nof  poisoned  ice  pierce  his  left  shoulder.  Even  as  he  swooned \\nhe  caught,  as  through  a  swirling  mist,  a  glimpse  of  Strider \\nleaping  out  of  the  darkness  with  a  flaming  brand  of  wood  in \\neither  hand.  With  a  last  effort  Frodo,  dropping  his  sword, \\nslipped  the  Ring  from  his  finger  and  closed  his  right  hand \\ntight  upon  it. \\n\\n\\nChapter  12 \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD \\n\\n\\nWhen  Frodo  came  to  himself  he  was  still  clutching  the  Ring \\ndesperately.  He  was  lying  by  the  fire,  which  was  now  piled \\nhigh  and  burning  brightly.  His  three  companions  were  bend¬ \\ning  over  him. \\n\\nWhat  has  happened?  Where  is  the  pale  king?’  he  asked \\nwildly. \\n\\nThey  were  too  overjoyed  to  hear  him  speak  to  answer  for \\na  while;  nor  did  they  understand  his  question.  At  length  he \\ngathered  from  Sam  that  they  had  seen  nothing  but  the  vague \\nshadowy  shapes  coming  towards  them.  Suddenly  to  his \\nhorror  Sam  found  that  his  master  had  vanished;  and  at  that \\nmoment  a  black  shadow  rushed  past  him,  and  he  fell.  He \\nheard  Frodo’s  voice,  but  it  seemed  to  come  from  a  great \\ndistance,  or  from  under  the  earth,  crying  out  strange  words. \\nThey  saw  nothing  more,  until  they  stumbled  over  the  body \\nof  Frodo,  lying  as  if  dead,  face  downwards  on  the  grass  with \\nhis  sword  beneath  him.  Strider  ordered  them  to  pick  him  up \\nand  lay  him  near  the  fire,  and  then  he  disappeared.  That  was \\nnow  a  good  while  ago. \\n\\nSam  plainly  was  beginning  to  have  doubts  again  about \\nStrider;  but  while  they  were  talking  he  returned,  appearing \\nsuddenly  out  of  the  shadows.  They  started,  and  Sam  drew \\nhis  sword  and  stood  over  Frodo;  but  Strider  knelt  down \\nswiftly  at  his  side. \\n\\n‘I  am  not  a  Black  Rider,  Sam,’  he  said  gently,  ‘nor  in  league \\nwith  them.  I  have  been  trying  to  discover  something  of  their \\nmovements;  but  I  have  found  nothing.  I  cannot  think  why \\nthey  have  gone  and  do  not  attack  again.  But  there  is  no  feeling \\nof  their  presence  anywhere  at  hand.’ \\n\\nWhen  he  heard  what  Frodo  had  to  tell,  he  became  full  of \\n\\n\\n258 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nconcern,  and  shook  his  head  and  sighed.  Then  he  ordered \\nPippin  and  Merry  to  heat  as  much  water  as  they  could  in \\ntheir  small  kettles,  and  to  bathe  the  wound  with  it.  ‘Keep  the \\nfire  going  well,  and  keep  Frodo  warm!’  he  said.  Then  he \\ngot  up  and  walked  away,  and  called  Sam  to  him.  ‘I  think  I \\nunderstand  things  better  now,’  he  said  in  a  low  voice.  ‘There \\nseem  only  to  have  been  five  of  the  enemy.  Why  they  were \\nnot  all  here,  I  don’t  know;  but  I  don’t  think  they  expected  to \\nbe  resisted.  They  have  drawn  off  for  the  time  being.  But  not \\nfar,  I  fear.  They  will  come  again  another  night,  if  we  cannot \\nescape.  They  are  only  waiting,  because  they  think  that  their \\npurpose  is  almost  accomplished,  and  that  the  Ring  cannot  fly \\nmuch  further.  I  fear,  Sam,  that  they  believe  your  master  has \\na  deadly  wound  that  will  subdue  him  to  their  will.  We  shall \\nsee!’ \\n\\nSam  choked  with  tears.  ‘Don’t  despair!’  said  Strider.  ‘You \\nmust  trust  me  now.  Your  Frodo  is  made  of  sterner  stuff  than \\nI  had  guessed,  though  Gandalf  hinted  that  it  might  prove  so. \\nHe  is  not  slain,  and  I  think  he  will  resist  the  evil  power  of  the \\nwound  longer  than  his  enemies  expect.  I  will  do  all  I  can  to \\nhelp  and  heal  him.  Guard  him  well,  while  I  am  away!’  He \\nhurried  off  and  disappeared  again  into  the  darkness. \\n\\nFrodo  dozed,  though  the  pain  of  his  wound  was  slowly \\ngrowing,  and  a  deadly  chill  was  spreading  from  his  shoulder \\nto  his  arm  and  side.  His  friends  watched  over  him,  warming \\nhim,  and  bathing  his  wound.  The  night  passed  slowly  and \\nwearily.  Dawn  was  growing  in  the  sky,  and  the  dell  was  filling \\nwith  grey  light,  when  Strider  at  last  returned. \\n\\n‘Look!’  he  cried;  and  stooping  he  lifted  from  the  ground  a \\nblack  cloak  that  had  lain  there  hidden  by  the  darkness.  A  foot \\nabove  the  lower  hem  there  was  a  slash.  ‘This  was  the  stroke \\nof  Frodo’s  sword,’  he  said.  ‘The  only  hurt  that  it  did  to  his \\nenemy,  I  fear;  for  it  is  unharmed,  but  all  blades  perish  that \\npierce  that  dreadful  King.  More  deadly  to  him  was  the  name \\nof  Elbereth.’ \\n\\n‘And  more  deadly  to  Frodo  was  this!’  He  stooped  again \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD \\n\\n\\n259 \\n\\n\\nand  lifted  up  a  long  thin  knife.  There  was  a  cold  gleam  in  it. \\nAs  Strider  raised  it  they  saw  that  near  the  end  its  edge  was \\nnotched  and  the  point  was  broken  off.  But  even  as  he  held  it \\nup  in  the  growing  light,  they  gazed  in  astonishment,  for  the \\nblade  seemed  to  melt,  and  vanished  like  a  smoke  in  the  air, \\nleaving  only  the  hilt  in  Strider’s  hand.  ‘Alas!’  he  cried.  ‘It  was \\nthis  accursed  knife  that  gave  the  wound.  Few  now  have  the \\nskill  in  healing  to  match  such  evil  weapons.  But  I  will  do  what \\nI  can.’ \\n\\nHe  sat  down  on  the  ground,  and  taking  the  dagger-hilt  laid \\nit  on  his  knees,  and  he  sang  over  it  a  slow  song  in  a  strange \\ntongue.  Then  setting  it  aside,  he  turned  to  Frodo  and  in  a \\nsoft  tone  spoke  words  the  others  could  not  catch.  From  the \\npouch  at  his  belt  he  drew  out  the  long  leaves  of  a  plant. \\n\\n‘These  leaves,’  he  said,  ‘I  have  walked  far  to  find;  for \\nthis  plant  does  not  grow  in  the  bare  hills;  but  in  the  thickets \\naway  south  of  the  Road  I  found  it  in  the  dark  by  the  scent \\nof  its  leaves.’  He  crushed  a  leaf  in  his  fingers,  and  it  gave  out \\na  sweet  and  pungent  fragrance.  ‘It  is  fortunate  that  I  could \\nfind  it,  for  it  is  a  healing  plant  that  the  Men  of  the  West \\nbrought  to  Middle-earth.  Athelas  they  named  it,  and  it  grows \\nnow  sparsely  and  only  near  places  where  they  dwelt  or \\ncamped  of  old;  and  it  is  not  known  in  the  North,  except  to \\nsome  of  those  who  wander  in  the  Wild.  It  has  great  virtues, \\nbut  over  such  a  wound  as  this  its  healing  powers  may  be \\nsmall.’ \\n\\nHe  threw  the  leaves  into  boiling  water  and  bathed  Frodo’s \\nshoulder.  The  fragrance  of  the  steam  was  refreshing,  and \\nthose  that  were  unhurt  felt  their  minds  calmed  and  cleared. \\nThe  herb  had  also  some  power  over  the  wound,  for  Frodo \\nfelt  the  pain  and  also  the  sense  of  frozen  cold  lessen  in  his \\nside;  but  the  life  did  not  return  to  his  arm,  and  he  could  not \\nraise  or  use  his  hand.  He  bitterly  regretted  his  foolishness, \\nand  reproached  himself  for  weakness  of  will;  for  he  now \\nperceived  that  in  putting  on  the  Ring  he  obeyed  not  his \\nown  desire  but  the  commanding  wish  of  his  enemies.  He \\nwondered  if  he  would  remain  maimed  for  life,  and  how  they \\n\\n\\n260 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nwould  now  manage  to  continue  their  journey.  He  felt  too \\nweak  to  stand. \\n\\nThe  others  were  discussing  this  very  question.  They \\nquickly  decided  to  leave  Weathertop  as  soon  as  possible.  ‘I \\nthink  now,’  said  Strider,  ‘that  the  enemy  has  been  watching \\nthis  place  for  some  days.  If  Gandalf  ever  came  here,  then  he \\nmust  have  been  forced  to  ride  away,  and  he  will  not  return. \\nIn  any  case  we  are  in  great  peril  here  after  dark,  since  the \\nattack  of  last  night,  and  we  can  hardly  meet  greater  danger \\nwherever  we  go.’ \\n\\nAs  soon  as  the  daylight  was  full,  they  had  some  hurried \\nfood  and  packed.  It  was  impossible  for  Frodo  to  walk,  so  they \\ndivided  the  greater  part  of  their  baggage  among  the  four  of \\nthem,  and  put  Frodo  on  the  pony.  In  the  last  few  days  the \\npoor  beast  had  improved  wonderfully;  it  already  seemed  fat¬ \\nter  and  stronger,  and  had  begun  to  show  an  affection  for  its \\nnew  masters,  especially  for  Sam.  Bill  Ferny’s  treatment  must \\nhave  been  very  hard  for  the  journey  in  the  wild  to  seem  so \\nmuch  better  than  its  former  life. \\n\\nThey  started  off  in  a  southerly  direction.  This  would  mean \\ncrossing  the  Road,  but  it  was  the  quickest  way  to  more \\nwooded  country.  And  they  needed  fuel;  for  Strider  said  that \\nFrodo  must  be  kept  warm,  especially  at  night,  while  fire \\nwould  be  some  protection  for  them  all.  It  was  also  his  plan \\nto  shorten  their  journey  by  cutting  across  another  great  loop \\nof  the  Road:  east  beyond  Weathertop  it  changed  its  course \\nand  took  a  wide  bend  northwards. \\n\\nThey  made  their  way  slowly  and  cautiously  round  the \\nsouth-western  slopes  of  the  hill,  and  came  in  a  little  while  to \\nthe  edge  of  the  Road.  There  was  no  sign  of  the  Riders.  But \\neven  as  they  were  hurrying  across  they  heard  far  away  two \\ncries:  a  cold  voice  calling  and  a  cold  voice  answering.  Trem¬ \\nbling  they  sprang  forward,  and  made  for  the  thickets  that  lay \\nahead.  The  land  before  them  sloped  away  southwards,  but  it \\nwas  wild  and  pathless;  bushes  and  stunted  trees  grew  in  dense \\npatches  with  wide  barren  spaces  in  between.  The  grass  was \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD \\n\\n\\n26l \\n\\n\\nscanty,  coarse,  and  grey;  and  the  leaves  in  the  thickets  were \\nfaded  and  falling.  It  was  a  cheerless  land,  and  their  journey \\nwas  slow  and  gloomy.  They  spoke  little  as  they  trudged \\nalong.  Frodo’s  heart  was  grieved  as  he  watched  them  walking \\nbeside  him  with  their  heads  down,  and  their  backs  bowed \\nunder  their  burdens.  Even  Strider  seemed  tired  and  heavy- \\nhearted. \\n\\nBefore  the  first  day’s  march  was  over  Frodo’s  pain  began \\nto  grow  again,  but  he  did  not  speak  of  it  for  a  long  time.  Four \\ndays  passed,  without  the  ground  or  the  scene  changing \\nmuch,  except  that  behind  them  Weathertop  slowly  sank,  and \\nbefore  them  the  distant  mountains  loomed  a  little  nearer.  Yet \\nsince  that  far  cry  they  had  seen  and  heard  no  sign  that  the \\nenemy  had  marked  their  flight  or  followed  them.  They \\ndreaded  the  dark  hours,  and  kept  watch  in  pairs  by  night, \\nexpecting  at  any  time  to  see  black  shapes  stalking  in  the \\ngrey  night,  dimly  lit  by  the  cloud-veiled  moon;  but  they  saw \\nnothing,  and  heard  no  sound  but  the  sigh  of  withered  leaves \\nand  grass.  Not  once  did  they  feel  the  sense  of  present  evil \\nthat  had  assailed  them  before  the  attack  in  the  dell.  It  seemed \\ntoo  much  to  hope  that  the  Riders  had  already  lost  their  trail \\nagain.  Perhaps  they  were  waiting  to  make  some  ambush  in  a \\nnarrow  place? \\n\\nAt  the  end  of  the  fifth  day  the  ground  began  once  more  to \\nrise  slowly  out  of  the  wide  shallow  valley  into  which  they  had \\ndescended.  Strider  now  turned  their  course  again  north¬ \\neastwards,  and  on  the  sixth  day  they  reached  the  top  of  a \\nlong  slow-climbing  slope,  and  saw  far  ahead  a  huddle  of \\nwooded  hills.  Away  below  them  they  could  see  the  Road \\nsweeping  round  the  feet  of  the  hills;  and  to  their  right  a  grey \\nriver  gleamed  pale  in  the  thin  sunshine.  In  the  distance  they \\nglimpsed  yet  another  river  in  a  stony  valley  half-veiled  in \\nmist. \\n\\n‘I  am  afraid  we  must  go  back  to  the  Road  here  for  a  while,’ \\nsaid  Strider.  ‘We  have  now  come  to  the  River  Hoarwell,  that \\nthe  Elves  call  Mitheithel.  It  flows  down  out  of  the  Ettenmoors, \\nthe  troll-fells  north  of  Rivendell,  and  joins  the  Loudwater \\n\\n\\n262 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\naway  in  the  South.  Some  call  it  the  Greyflood  after  that.  It  is \\na  great  water  before  it  finds  the  Sea.  There  is  no  way  over  it \\nbelow  its  sources  in  the  Ettenmoors,  except  by  the  Last \\nBridge  on  which  the  Road  crosses.’ \\n\\n‘What  is  that  other  river  we  can  see  far  away  there?’  asked \\nMerry. \\n\\n‘That  is  Loudwater,  the  Bruinen  of  Rivendell,’  answered \\nStrider.  ‘The  Road  runs  along  the  edge  of  the  hills  for  many \\nmiles  from  the  Bridge  to  the  Ford  of  Bruinen.  But  I  have  not \\nyet  thought  how  we  shall  cross  that  water.  One  river  at  a \\ntime!  We  shall  be  fortunate  indeed  if  we  do  not  find  the  Last \\nBridge  held  against  us.’ \\n\\nNext  day,  early  in  the  morning,  they  came  down  again  to \\nthe  borders  of  the  Road.  Sam  and  Strider  went  forward,  but \\nthey  found  no  sign  of  any  travellers  or  riders.  Here  under  the \\nshadow  of  the  hills  there  had  been  some  rain.  Strider  judged \\nthat  it  had  fallen  two  days  before,  and  had  washed  away  all \\nfootprints.  No  horseman  had  passed  since  then,  as  far  as  he \\ncould  see. \\n\\nThey  hurried  along  with  all  the  speed  they  could  make, \\nand  after  a  mile  or  two  they  saw  the  Last  Bridge  ahead,  at \\nthe  bottom  of  a  short  steep  slope.  They  dreaded  to  see  black \\nfigures  waiting  there,  but  they  saw  none.  Strider  made  them \\ntake  cover  in  a  thicket  at  the  side  of  the  Road,  while  he  went \\nforward  to  explore. \\n\\nBefore  long  he  came  hurrying  back.  ‘I  can  see  no  sign  of \\nthe  enemy,’  he  said,  ‘and  I  wonder  very  much  what  that \\nmeans.  But  I  have  found  something  very  strange.’ \\n\\nHe  held  out  his  hand,  and  showed  a  single  pale-green  jewel. \\n‘I  found  it  in  the  mud  in  the  middle  of  the  Bridge,’  he  said. \\n‘It  is  a  beryl,  an  elf-stone.  Whether  it  was  set  there,  or  let  fall \\nby  chance,  I  cannot  say;  but  it  brings  hope  to  me.  I  will  take \\nit  as  a  sign  that  we  may  pass  the  Bridge;  but  beyond  that  I \\ndare  not  keep  to  the  Road,  without  some  clearer  token.’ \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD \\n\\n\\n263 \\n\\n\\nAt  once  they  went  on  again.  They  crossed  the  Bridge  in \\nsafety,  hearing  no  sound  but  the  water  swirling  against  its \\nthree  great  arches.  A  mile  further  on  they  came  to  a  narrow \\nravine  that  led  away  northwards  through  the  steep  lands  on \\nthe  left  of  the  Road.  Here  Strider  turned  aside,  and  soon  they \\nwere  lost  in  a  sombre  country  of  dark  trees  winding  among \\nthe  feet  of  sullen  hills. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  were  glad  to  leave  the  cheerless  lands  and \\nthe  perilous  Road  behind  them;  but  this  new  country  seemed \\nthreatening  and  unfriendly.  As  they  went  forward  the  hills \\nabout  them  steadily  rose.  Here  and  there  upon  heights  and \\nridges  they  caught  glimpses  of  ancient  walls  of  stone,  and \\nthe  ruins  of  towers:  they  had  an  ominous  look.  Frodo,  who \\nwas  not  walking,  had  time  to  gaze  ahead  and  to  think.  He \\nrecalled  Bilbo’s  account  of  his  journey  and  the  threatening \\ntowers  on  the  hills  north  of  the  Road,  in  the  country  near \\nthe  Trolls’  wood  where  his  first  serious  adventure  had \\nhappened.  Frodo  guessed  that  they  were  now  in  the  same \\nregion,  and  wondered  if  by  chance  they  would  pass  near \\nthe  spot. \\n\\n‘Who  lives  in  this  land?’  he  asked.  ‘And  who  built  these \\ntowers?  Is  this  troll-country?’ \\n\\n‘No!’  said  Strider.  ‘Trolls  do  not  build.  No  one  fives  in  this \\nland.  Men  once  dwelt  here,  ages  ago;  but  none  remain  now. \\nThey  became  an  evil  people,  as  legends  tell,  for  they  fell \\nunder  the  shadow  of  Angmar.  But  all  were  destroyed  in  the \\nwar  that  brought  the  North  Kingdom  to  its  end.  But  that  is \\nnow  so  long  ago  that  the  hills  have  forgotten  them,  though  a \\nshadow  still  lies  on  the  land.’ \\n\\n‘Where  did  you  learn  such  tales,  if  all  the  land  is  empty \\nand  forgetful?’  asked  Peregrin.  ‘The  birds  and  beasts  do  not \\ntell  tales  of  that  sort.’ \\n\\n‘The  heirs  of  Elendil  do  not  forget  all  things  past,’  said \\nSttider;  ‘and  many  more  things  than  I  can  tell  are  remem¬ \\nbered  in  Rivendell.’ \\n\\n‘Have  you  often  been  to  Rivendell?’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘I  have,’  said  Strider.  ‘I  dwelt  there  once,  and  still  I  return \\n\\n\\n264  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nwhen  I  may.  There  my  heart  is;  but  it  is  not  my  fate  to  sit  in \\npeace,  even  in  the  fair  house  of  Elrond.’ \\n\\nThe  hills  now  began  to  shut  them  in.  The  Road  behind \\nheld  on  its  way  to  the  River  Bruinen,  but  both  were  now \\nhidden  from  view.  The  travellers  came  into  a  long  valley; \\nnarrow,  deeply  cloven,  dark  and  silent.  Trees  with  old  and \\ntwisted  roots  hung  over  cliffs,  and  piled  up  behind  into \\nmounting  slopes  of  pine-wood. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  grew  very  weary.  They  advanced  slowly,  for \\nthey  had  to  pick  their  way  through  a  pathless  country,  encum¬ \\nbered  by  fallen  trees  and  tumbled  rocks.  As  long  as  they  could \\nthey  avoided  climbing  for  Frodo’s  sake,  and  because  it  was \\nin  fact  difficult  to  find  any  way  up  out  of  the  narrow  dales. \\nThey  had  been  two  days  in  this  country  when  the  weather \\nturned  wet.  The  wind  began  to  blow  steadily  out  of  the  West \\nand  pour  the  water  of  the  distant  seas  on  the  dark  heads  of \\nthe  hills  in  fine  drenching  rain.  By  nightfall  they  were  all \\nsoaked,  and  their  camp  was  cheerless,  for  they  could  not  get \\nany  fire  to  burn.  The  next  day  the  hills  rose  still  higher  and \\nsteeper  before  them,  and  they  were  forced  to  turn  away  north¬ \\nwards  out  of  their  course.  Strider  seemed  to  be  getting  anxi¬ \\nous:  they  were  nearly  ten  days  out  from  Weathertop,  and \\ntheir  stock  of  provisions  was  beginning  to  run  low.  It  went \\non  raining. \\n\\nThat  night  they  camped  on  a  stony  shelf  with  a  rock-wall \\nbehind  them,  in  which  there  was  a  shallow  cave,  a  mere  scoop \\nin  the  cliff.  Frodo  was  restless.  The  cold  and  wet  had  made \\nhis  wound  more  painful  than  ever,  and  the  ache  and  sense  of \\ndeadly  chill  took  away  all  sleep.  He  lay  tossing  and  turning \\nand  listening  fearfully  to  the  stealthy  night-noises:  wind  in \\nchinks  of  rock,  water  dripping,  a  crack,  the  sudden  rattling \\nfall  of  a  loosened  stone.  He  felt  that  black  shapes  were \\nadvancing  to  smother  him;  but  when  he  sat  up  he  saw  nothing \\nbut  the  back  of  Strider  sitting  hunched  up,  smoking  his  pipe, \\nand  watching.  He  lay  down  again  and  passed  into  an  uneasy \\ndream,  in  which  he  walked  on  the  grass  in  his  garden  in  the \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD  265 \\n\\nShire,  but  it  seemed  faint  and  dim,  less  clear  than  the  tall \\nblack  shadows  that  stood  looking  over  the  hedge. \\n\\nIn  the  morning  he  woke  to  find  that  the  rain  had  stopped. \\nThe  clouds  were  still  thick,  but  they  were  breaking,  and  pale \\nstrips  of  blue  appeared  between  them.  The  wind  was  shifting \\nagain.  They  did  not  start  early.  Immediately  after  their  cold \\nand  comfortless  breakfast  Strider  went  off  alone,  telling  the \\nothers  to  remain  under  the  shelter  of  the  cliff,  until  he  came \\nback.  He  was  going  to  climb  up,  if  he  could,  and  get  a  look \\nat  the  lie  of  the  land. \\n\\nWhen  he  returned  he  was  not  reassuring.  We  have  come \\ntoo  far  to  the  north,’  he  said,  ‘and  we  must  find  some  way  to \\nturn  back  southwards  again.  If  we  keep  on  as  we  are  going \\nwe  shall  get  up  into  the  Ettendales  far  north  of  Rivendell. \\nThat  is  troll-country,  and  little  known  to  me.  We  could  per¬ \\nhaps  find  our  way  through  and  come  round  to  Rivendell \\nfrom  the  north;  but  it  would  take  too  long,  for  I  do  not  know \\nthe  way,  and  our  food  would  not  last.  So  somehow  or  other \\nwe  must  find  the  Ford  of  Bruinen.’ \\n\\nThe  rest  of  that  day  they  spent  scrambling  over  rocky \\nground.  They  found  a  passage  between  two  hills  that  led \\nthem  into  a  valley  running  south-east,  the  direction  that  they \\nwished  to  take;  but  towards  the  end  of  the  day  they  found \\ntheir  road  again  barred  by  a  ridge  of  high  land;  its  dark  edge \\nagainst  the  sky  was  broken  into  many  bare  points  like  teeth \\nof  a  blunted  saw.  They  had  a  choice  between  going  back  or \\nclimbing  over  it. \\n\\nThey  decided  to  attempt  the  climb,  but  it  proved  very \\ndifficult.  Before  long  Frodo  was  obliged  to  dismount  and \\nstruggle  along  on  foot.  Even  so  they  often  despaired  of  getting \\ntheir  pony  up,  or  indeed  of  finding  a  path  for  themselves, \\nburdened  as  they  were.  The  light  was  nearly  gone,  and  they \\nwere  all  exhausted,  when  at  last  they  reached  the  top.  They \\nhad  climbed  on  to  a  narrow  saddle  between  two  higher  points, \\nand  the  land  fell  steeply  away  again,  only  a  short  distance \\nahead.  Frodo  threw  himself  down,  and  lay  on  the  ground \\n\\n\\n266 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nshivering.  His  left  arm  was  lifeless,  and  his  side  and  shoulder \\nfelt  as  if  icy  claws  were  laid  upon  them.  The  trees  and  rocks \\nabout  him  seemed  shadowy  and  dim. \\n\\n‘We  cannot  go  any  further,’  said  Merry  to  Strider.  ‘I  am \\nafraid  this  has  been  too  much  for  Frodo.  I  am  dreadfully \\nanxious  about  him.  What  are  we  to  do?  Do  you  think  they \\nwill  be  able  to  cure  him  in  Rivendell,  if  we  ever  get  there?’ \\n\\nWe  shall  see,’  answered  Strider.  ‘There  is  nothing  more \\nthat  I  can  do  in  the  wilderness;  and  it  is  chiefly  because  of \\nhis  wound  that  I  am  so  anxious  to  press  on.  But  I  agree  that \\nwe  can  go  no  further  tonight.’ \\n\\nWhat  is  the  matter  with  my  master?’  asked  Sam  in  a  low \\nvoice,  looking  appealingly  at  Strider.  ‘His  wound  was  small, \\nand  it  is  already  closed.  There’s  nothing  to  be  seen  but  a  cold \\nwhite  mark  on  his  shoulder.’ \\n\\n‘Frodo  has  been  touched  by  the  weapons  of  the  Enemy,’ \\nsaid  Strider,  ‘and  there  is  some  poison  or  evil  at  work  that \\nis  beyond  my  skill  to  drive  out.  But  do  not  give  up  hope, \\nSam!’ \\n\\nNight  was  cold  up  on  the  high  ridge.  They  lit  a  small  fire \\ndown  under  the  gnarled  roots  of  an  old  pine,  that  hung  over \\na  shallow  pit:  it  looked  as  if  stone  had  once  been  quarried \\nthere.  They  sat  huddled  together.  The  wind  blew  chill \\nthrough  the  pass,  and  they  heard  the  tree-tops  lower  down \\nmoaning  and  sighing.  Frodo  lay  half  in  a  dream,  imagining \\nthat  endless  dark  wings  were  sweeping  by  above  him,  and \\nthat  on  the  wings  rode  pursuers  that  sought  him  in  all  the \\nhollows  of  the  hills. \\n\\nThe  morning  dawned  bright  and  fair;  the  air  was  clean, \\nand  the  light  pale  and  clear  in  a  rain-washed  sky.  Their  hearts \\nwere  encouraged,  but  they  longed  for  the  sun  to  warm  their \\ncold  stiff  limbs.  As  soon  as  it  was  light,  Strider  took  Merry \\nwith  him  and  went  to  survey  the  country  from  the  height  to \\nthe  east  of  the  pass.  The  sun  had  risen  and  was  shining \\nbrightly  when  he  returned  with  more  comforting  news.  They \\nwere  now  going  more  or  less  in  the  right  direction.  If  they \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD \\n\\n\\n267 \\n\\n\\nwent  on,  down  the  further  side  of  the  ridge,  they  would \\nhave  the  Mountains  on  their  left.  Some  way  ahead  Strider \\nhad  caught  a  glimpse  of  the  Loudwater  again,  and  he  knew \\nthat,  though  it  was  hidden  from  view,  the  Road  to  the  Ford \\nwas  not  far  from  the  River  and  lay  on  the  side  nearest  to \\nthem. \\n\\n‘We  must  make  for  the  Road  again,’  he  said.  We  cannot \\nhope  to  find  a  path  through  these  hills.  Whatever  danger  may \\nbeset  it,  the  Road  is  our  only  way  to  the  Ford.’ \\n\\nAs  soon  as  they  had  eaten  they  set  out  again.  They  climbed \\nslowly  down  the  southern  side  of  the  ridge;  but  the  way  was \\nmuch  easier  than  they  had  expected,  for  the  slope  was  far \\nless  steep  on  this  side,  and  before  long  Frodo  was  able  to \\nride  again.  Bill  Ferny’s  poor  old  pony  was  developing  an \\nunexpected  talent  for  picking  out  a  path,  and  for  sparing  its \\nrider  as  many  jolts  as  possible.  The  spirits  of  the  party  rose \\nagain.  Even  Frodo  felt  better  in  the  morning  light,  but  every \\nnow  and  again  a  mist  seemed  to  obscure  his  sight,  and  he \\npassed  his  hands  over  his  eyes. \\n\\nPippin  was  a  little  ahead  of  the  others.  Suddenly  he  turned \\nround  and  called  to  them.  ‘There  is  a  path  here!’  he  cried. \\n\\nWhen  they  came  up  with  him,  they  saw  that  he  had  made \\nno  mistake:  there  were  clearly  the  beginnings  of  a  path,  that \\nclimbed  with  many  windings  out  of  the  woods  below  and \\nfaded  away  on  the  hill-top  behind.  In  places  it  was  now  faint \\nand  overgrown,  or  choked  with  fallen  stones  and  trees;  but \\nat  one  time  it  seemed  to  have  been  much  used.  It  was  a  path \\nmade  by  strong  arms  and  heavy  feet.  Here  and  there  old  trees \\nhad  been  cut  or  broken  down,  and  large  rocks  cloven  or \\nheaved  aside  to  make  a  way. \\n\\nThey  followed  the  track  for  some  while,  for  it  offered  much \\nthe  easiest  way  down,  but  they  went  cautiously,  and  their \\nanxiety  increased  as  they  came  into  the  dark  woods,  and  the \\npath  grew  plainer  and  broader.  Suddenly  coming  out  of  a \\nbelt  of  fir-trees  it  ran  steeply  down  a  slope,  and  turned  sharply \\nto  the  left  round  the  corner  of  a  rocky  shoulder  of  the  hill. \\n\\n\\n268 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nWhen  they  came  to  the  corner  they  looked  round  and  saw \\nthat  the  path  ran  on  over  a  level  strip  under  the  face  of  a  low \\ncliff  overhung  with  trees.  In  the  stony  wall  there  was  a  door \\nhanging  crookedly  ajar  upon  one  great  hinge. \\n\\nOutside  the  door  they  all  halted.  There  was  a  cave  or \\nrock-chamber  behind,  but  in  the  gloom  inside  nothing  could \\nbe  seen.  Strider,  Sam,  and  Merry  pushing  with  all  their \\nstrength  managed  to  open  the  door  a  little  wider,  and  then \\nStrider  and  Merry  went  in.  They  did  not  go  far,  for  on  the \\nfloor  lay  many  old  bones,  and  nothing  else  was  to  be  seen \\nnear  the  entrance  except  some  great  empty  jars  and  broken \\npots. \\n\\n‘Surely  this  is  a  troll-hole,  if  ever  there  was  one!’  said \\nPippin.  ‘Come  out,  you  two,  and  let  us  get  away.  Now  we \\nknow  who  made  the  path  -  and  we  had  better  get  off  it  quick.’ \\n\\n‘There  is  no  need,  I  think,’  said  Strider,  coming  out.  ‘It  is \\ncertainly  a  troll-hole,  but  it  seems  to  have  been  long  forsaken. \\nI  don’t  think  we  need  be  afraid.  But  let  us  go  on  down  warily, \\nand  we  shall  see.’ \\n\\nThe  path  went  on  again  from  the  door,  and  turning  to  the \\nright  again  across  the  level  space  plunged  down  a  thick \\nwooded  slope.  Pippin,  not  liking  to  show  Strider  that  he  was \\nstill  afraid,  went  on  ahead  with  Merry.  Sam  and  Strider  came \\nbehind,  one  on  each  side  of  Frodo’s  pony,  for  the  path  was \\nnow  broad  enough  for  four  or  five  hobbits  to  walk  abreast. \\nBut  they  had  not  gone  very  far  before  Pippin  came  running \\nback,  followed  by  Merry.  They  both  looked  terrified. \\n\\n‘There  are  trolls!’  Pippin  panted.  ‘Down  in  a  clearing  in \\nthe  woods  not  far  below.  We  got  a  sight  of  them  through  the \\ntree-trunks.  They  are  very  large!’ \\n\\n‘We  will  come  and  look  at  them,’  said  Strider,  picking  up \\na  stick.  Frodo  said  nothing,  but  Sam  looked  scared. \\n\\nThe  sun  was  now  high,  and  it  shone  down  through  the \\nhalf-stripped  branches  of  the  trees,  and  lit  the  clearing  with \\nbright  patches  of  light.  They  halted  suddenly  on  the  edge, \\nand  peered  through  the  tree-trunks,  holding  their  breath. \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD  269 \\n\\nThere  stood  the  trolls:  three  large  trolls.  One  was  stooping, \\nand  the  other  two  stood  staring  at  him. \\n\\nStrider  walked  forward  unconcernedly.  ‘Get  up,  old  stone!’ \\nhe  said,  and  broke  his  stick  upon  the  stooping  troll. \\n\\nNothing  happened.  There  was  a  gasp  of  astonishment \\nfrom  the  hobbits,  and  then  even  Frodo  laughed.  ‘Well!’  he \\nsaid.  ‘We  are  forgetting  our  family  history!  These  must  be \\nthe  very  three  that  were  caught  by  Gandalf,  quarrelling  over \\nthe  right  way  to  cook  thirteen  dwarves  and  one  hobbit.’ \\n\\n‘I  had  no  idea  we  were  anywhere  near  the  place!’  said \\nPippin.  He  knew  the  story  well.  Bilbo  and  Frodo  had  told  it \\noften;  but  as  a  matter  of  fact  he  had  never  more  than  half \\nbelieved  it.  Even  now  he  looked  at  the  stone  trolls  with  sus¬ \\npicion,  wondering  if  some  magic  might  not  suddenly  bring \\nthem  to  life  again. \\n\\n‘You  are  forgetting  not  only  your  family  history,  but  all \\nyou  ever  knew  about  trolls,’  said  Strider.  ‘It  is  broad  daylight \\nwith  a  bright  sun,  and  yet  you  come  back  trying  to  scare  me \\nwith  a  tale  of  live  trolls  waiting  for  us  in  this  glade!  In  any \\ncase  you  might  have  noticed  that  one  of  them  has  an  old \\nbird’s  nest  behind  his  ear.  That  would  be  a  most  unusual \\nornament  for  a  live  troll!’ \\n\\nThey  all  laughed.  Frodo  felt  his  spirits  reviving:  the  re¬ \\nminder  of  Bilbo’s  first  successful  adventure  was  heartening. \\nThe  sun,  too,  was  warm  and  comforting,  and  the  mist  before \\nhis  eyes  seemed  to  be  lifting  a  little.  They  rested  for  some \\ntime  in  the  glade,  and  took  their  mid-day  meal  right  under \\nthe  shadow  of  the  trolls’  large  legs. \\n\\n‘Won’t  somebody  give  us  a  bit  of  a  song,  while  the  sun  is \\nhigh?’  said  Merry,  when  they  had  finished.  ‘We  haven’t  had \\na  song  or  a  tale  for  days.’ \\n\\n‘Not  since  Weathertop,’  said  Frodo.  The  others  looked  at \\nhim.  ‘Don’t  worry  about  me!’  he  added.  ‘I  feel  much  better, \\nbut  I  don’t  think  I  could  sing.  Perhaps  Sam  could  dig  some¬ \\nthing  out  of  his  memory.’ \\n\\n‘Come  on,  Sam!’  said  Merry.  ‘There’s  more  stored  in  your \\nhead  than  you  let  on  about.’ \\n\\n\\n270 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘I  don’t  know  about  that,’  said  Sam.  ‘But  how  would  this \\nsuit?  It  ain’t  what  I  call  proper  poetry,  if  you  understand  me: \\njust  a  bit  of  nonsense.  But  these  old  images  here  brought  it \\nto  my  mind.’  Standing  up,  with  his  hands  behind  his  back, \\nas  if  he  was  at  school,  he  began  to  sing  to  an  old  tune. \\n\\nTroll  sat  alone  on  his  seat  of  stone, \\n\\nAnd  munched  and  mumbled  a  bare  old  bone; \\n\\nFor  many  a  year  he  had  gnawed  it  near, \\n\\nFor  meat  was  hard  to  come  by. \\n\\nDone  by!  Gum  by! \\n\\nIn  a  cave  in  the  hills  he  dwelt  alone, \\n\\nAnd  meat  was  hard  to  come  by. \\n\\nUp  came  Tom  with  his  big  boots  on. \\n\\nSaid  he  to  Troll:  ‘Pray,  what  is  yon? \\n\\nFor  it  looks  like  the  shin  o’  my  nuncle  Tim, \\n\\nAs  should  be  a-lyin ’  in  graveyard. \\n\\nCaveyard!  Paveyard! \\n\\nThis  many  a  year  has  Tim  been  gone, \\n\\nAnd  I  thought  he  were  lyin’  in  graveyard.’ \\n\\n‘My  lad,’  said  Troll,  ‘this  bone  I  stole. \\n\\nBut  what  be  bones  that  lie  in  a  hole? \\n\\nThy  nuncle  was  dead  as  a  lump  o’  lead, \\n\\nAfore  I  found  his  shinbone. \\n\\nTinbone!  Thinbone! \\n\\nHe  can  spare  a  share  for  a  poor  old  troll, \\n\\nFor  he  don’t  need  his  shinbone.’ \\n\\nSaid  Tom:  7  don’t  see  why  the  likes  o’  thee \\nWithout  axin’  leave  should  go  makin’  free \\nWith  the  shank  or  the  shin  o’  my  father’s  kin; \\n\\nSo  hand  the  old  bone  over! \\n\\nRover!  Trover! \\n\\nThough  dead  he  be,  it  belongs  to  he; \\n\\nSo  hand  the  old  bone  over!’ \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD \\n\\n\\n271 \\n\\n\\nFor  a  couple  o’  pins,’  says  Troll,  and  grins, \\n\\n‘I’ll  eat  thee  too,  and  gnaw  thy  shins. \\n\\nA  bit  0’  fresh  meat  will  go  down  sweet! \\n\\nI’ll  try  my  teeth  on  thee  now. \\n\\nHee  now!  See  now! \\n\\nI’m  tired  o’  gnawing  old  bones  and  skins; \\n\\nI’ve  a  mind  to  dine  on  thee  now.  ’ \\n\\nBut  just  as  he  thought,  his  dinner  was  caught, \\n\\nHe  found  his  hands  had  hold  of  naught. \\n\\nBefore  he  could  mind,  Tom  slipped  behind \\nAnd  gave  him  the  boot  to  larn  him. \\n\\nWarn  him!  Darn  him! \\n\\nA  bump  o’  the  boot  on  the  seat,  Tom  thought, \\n\\nWould  be  the  way  to  larn  him. \\n\\nBut  harder  than  stone  is  the  flesh  and  bone \\nOf  a  troll  that  sits  in  the  hills  alone. \\n\\nAs  well  set  your  boot  to  the  mountain’s  root, \\n\\nFor  the  seat  of  a  troll  don’t  feel  it. \\n\\nPeel  it!  Heal  it! \\n\\nOld  Troll  laughed,  when  he  heard  Tom  groan, \\n\\nAnd  he  knew  his  toes  could  feel  it. \\n\\nTom’s  leg  is  game,  since  home  he  came, \\n\\nAnd  his  bootless  foot  is  lasting  lame; \\n\\nBut  Troll  don’t  care,  and  he’s  still  there \\nWith  the  bone  he  boned  from  its  owner. \\n\\nDoner!  Boner! \\n\\nTroll’s  old  seat  is  still  the  same, \\n\\nAnd  the  bone  he  boned  from  its  owner! \\n\\n‘Well,  that’s  a  warning  to  us  all!’  laughed  Merry.  ‘It  is  as \\nwell  you  used  a  stick,  and  not  your  hand,  Strider!’ \\n\\n‘Where  did  you  come  by  that,  Sam?’  asked  Pippin.  ‘I’ve \\nnever  heard  those  words  before.’ \\n\\nSam  muttered  something  inaudible.  ‘It’s  out  of  his  own \\n\\n\\n272  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nhead,  of  course,’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  am  learning  a  lot  about  Sam \\nGamgee  on  this  journey.  First  he  was  a  conspirator,  now  he’s \\na  jester.  He’ll  end  up  by  becoming  a  wizard  -  or  a  warrior!’ \\n\\n‘I  hope  not,’  said  Sam.  ‘I  don’t  want  to  be  neither!’ \\n\\nIn  the  afternoon  they  went  on  down  the  woods.  They  were \\nprobably  following  the  very  track  that  Gandalf,  Bilbo,  and \\nthe  dwarves  had  used  many  years  before.  After  a  few  miles \\nthey  came  out  on  the  top  of  a  high  bank  above  the  Road.  At \\nthis  point  the  Road  had  left  the  Hoarwell  far  behind  in  its \\nnarrow  valley,  and  now  clung  close  to  the  feet  of  the  hills, \\nrolling  and  winding  eastward  among  woods  and  heather- \\ncovered  slopes  towards  the  Ford  and  the  Mountains.  Not  far \\ndown  the  bank  Strider  pointed  out  a  stone  in  the  grass.  On \\nit  roughly  cut  and  now  much  weathered  could  still  be  seen \\ndwarf-runes  and  secret  marks. \\n\\n‘There!’  said  Merry.  ‘That  must  be  the  stone  that  marked \\nthe  place  where  the  trolls’  gold  was  hidden.  How  much  is  left \\nof  Bilbo’s  share,  I  wonder,  Frodo?’ \\n\\nFrodo  looked  at  the  stone,  and  wished  that  Bilbo  had \\nbrought  home  no  treasure  more  perilous,  nor  less  easy  to  part \\nwith.  ‘None  at  all,’  he  said.  ‘Bilbo  gave  it  all  away.  He  told \\nme  he  did  not  feel  it  was  really  his,  as  it  came  from  robbers.’ \\n\\nThe  Road  lay  quiet  under  the  long  shadows  of  early \\nevening.  There  was  no  sign  of  any  other  travellers  to  be  seen. \\nAs  there  was  now  no  other  possible  course  for  them  to  take, \\nthey  climbed  down  the  bank,  and  turning  left  went  off  as  fast \\nas  they  could.  Soon  a  shoulder  of  the  hills  cut  off  the  light  of \\nthe  fast  westering  sun.  A  cold  wind  flowed  down  to  meet \\nthem  from  the  mountains  ahead. \\n\\nThey  were  beginning  to  look  out  for  a  place  off  the  Road, \\nwhere  they  could  camp  for  the  night,  when  they  heard  a \\nsound  that  brought  sudden  fear  back  into  their  hearts:  the \\nnoise  of  hoofs  behind  them.  They  looked  back,  but  they  could \\nnot  see  far  because  of  the  many  windings  and  rollings  of  the \\nRoad.  As  quickly  as  they  could  they  scrambled  off  the  beaten \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD \\n\\n\\n273 \\n\\n\\nway  and  up  into  the  deep  heather  and  bilberry  brushwood \\non  the  slopes  above,  until  they  came  to  a  small  patch  of \\nthick-growing  hazels.  As  they  peered  out  from  among  the \\nbushes,  they  could  see  the  Road,  faint  and  grey  in  the  failing \\nlight,  some  thirty  feet  below  them.  The  sound  of  hoofs  drew \\nnearer.  They  were  going  fast,  with  a  light  clippety-clippety-clip. \\nThen  faintly,  as  if  it  was  blown  away  from  them  by  the  breeze, \\nthey  seemed  to  catch  a  dim  ringing,  as  of  small  bells  tinkling. \\n\\n‘That  does  not  sound  like  a  Black  Rider’s  horse!’  said \\nFrodo,  listening  intently.  The  other  hobbits  agreed  hopefully \\nthat  it  did  not,  but  they  all  remained  full  of  suspicion.  They \\nhad  been  in  fear  of  pursuit  for  so  long  that  any  sound  from \\nbehind  seemed  ominous  and  unfriendly.  But  Strider  was  now \\nleaning  forward,  stooped  to  the  ground,  with  a  hand  to  his \\near,  and  a  look  of  joy  on  his  face. \\n\\nThe  light  faded,  and  the  leaves  on  the  bushes  rustled  softly. \\nClearer  and  nearer  now  the  bells  jingled,  and  clippety-clip \\ncame  the  quick  trotting  feet.  Suddenly  into  view  below  came \\na  white  horse,  gleaming  in  the  shadows,  running  swiftly.  In \\nthe  dusk  its  headstall  flickered  and  flashed,  as  if  it  were  stud¬ \\nded  with  gems  like  living  stars.  The  rider’s  cloak  streamed \\nbehind  him,  and  his  hood  was  thrown  back;  his  golden  hair \\nflowed  shimmering  in  the  wind  of  his  speed.  To  Frodo  it \\nappeared  that  a  white  light  was  shining  through  the  form  and \\nraiment  of  the  rider,  as  if  through  a  thin  veil. \\n\\nStrider  sprang  from  hiding  and  dashed  down  towards  the \\nRoad,  leaping  with  a  cry  through  the  heather;  but  even  before \\nhe  had  moved  or  called,  the  rider  had  reined  in  his  horse  and \\nhalted,  looking  up  towards  the  thicket  where  they  stood. \\nWhen  he  saw  Strider,  he  dismounted  and  ran  to  meet  him \\ncalling  out:  Ai  na  vedui  Dunadan!  Mae  govannen!  His  speech \\nand  clear  ringing  voice  left  no  doubt  in  their  hearts:  the  rider \\nwas  of  the  Elven-folk.  No  others  that  dwelt  in  the  wide  world \\nhad  voices  so  fair  to  hear.  But  there  seemed  to  be  a  note  of \\nhaste  or  fear  in  his  call,  and  they  saw  that  he  was  now  speaking \\nquickly  and  urgently  to  Strider. \\n\\nSoon  Strider  beckoned  to  them,  and  the  hobbits  left  the \\n\\n\\n274  THE  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nbushes  and  hurried  down  to  the  Road.  ‘This  is  Glorfindel, \\nwho  dwells  in  the  house  of  Elrond,’  said  Strider. \\n\\n‘Hail,  and  well  met  at  last!’  said  the  Elf-lord  to  Frodo.  ‘I \\nwas  sent  from  Rivendell  to  look  for  you.  We  feared  that  you \\nwere  in  danger  upon  the  road.’ \\n\\n‘Then  Gandalf  has  reached  Rivendell?’  cried  Frodo \\njoyfully. \\n\\n‘No.  He  had  not  when  I  departed;  but  that  was  nine  days \\nago,’  answered  Glorfindel.  ‘Elrond  received  news  that \\ntroubled  him.  Some  of  my  kindred,  journeying  in  your  land \\nbeyond  the  Baranduin,*  learned  that  things  were  amiss,  and \\nsent  messages  as  swiftly  as  they  could.  They  said  that  the \\nNine  were  abroad,  and  that  you  were  astray  bearing  a  great \\nburden  without  guidance,  for  Gandalf  had  not  returned. \\nThere  are  few  even  in  Rivendell  that  can  ride  openly  against \\nthe  Nine;  but  such  as  there  were,  Elrond  sent  out  north,  west, \\nand  south.  It  was  thought  that  you  might  turn  far  aside  to \\navoid  pursuit,  and  become  lost  in  the  Wilderness. \\n\\n‘It  was  my  lot  to  take  the  Road,  and  I  came  to  the  Bridge \\nof  Mitheithel,  and  left  a  token  there,  nigh  on  seven  days  ago. \\nThree  of  the  servants  of  Sauron  were  upon  the  Bridge,  but \\nthey  withdrew  and  I  pursued  them  westward.  I  came  also \\nupon  two  others,  but  they  turned  away  southward.  Since  then \\nI  have  searched  for  your  trail.  Two  days  ago  I  found  it,  and \\nfollowed  it  over  the  Bridge;  and  today  I  marked  where  you \\ndescended  from  the  hills  again.  But  come!  There  is  no  time \\nfor  further  news.  Since  you  are  here  we  must  risk  the  peril  of \\nthe  Road  and  go.  There  are  five  behind  us,  and  when  they \\nfind  your  trail  upon  the  Road  they  will  ride  after  us  like  the \\nwind.  And  they  are  not  all.  Where  the  other  four  may  be,  I \\ndo  not  know.  I  fear  that  we  may  find  the  Ford  is  already  held \\nagainst  us.’ \\n\\nWhile  Glorfindel  was  speaking  the  shades  of  evening  deep¬ \\nened.  Frodo  felt  a  great  weariness  come  over  him.  Ever  since \\nthe  sun  began  to  sink  the  mist  before  his  eyes  had  darkened, \\n\\n\\nThe  Brandywine  River. \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD \\n\\n\\n275 \\n\\n\\nand  he  felt  that  a  shadow  was  coming  between  him  and  the \\nfaces  of  his  friends.  Now  pain  assailed  him,  and  he  felt  cold. \\nHe  swayed,  clutching  at  Sam’s  arm. \\n\\n‘My  master  is  sick  and  wounded,’  said  Sam  angrily.  ‘He \\ncan’t  go  on  riding  after  nightfall.  He  needs  rest.’ \\n\\nGlorhndel  caught  Frodo  as  he  sank  to  the  ground,  and \\ntaking  him  gently  in  his  arms  he  looked  in  his  face  with  grave \\nanxiety. \\n\\nBriefly  Strider  told  of  the  attack  on  their  camp  under \\nWeathertop,  and  of  the  deadly  knife.  He  drew  out  the  hilt, \\nwhich  he  had  kept,  and  handed  it  to  the  Elf.  Glorfindel \\nshuddered  as  he  took  it,  but  he  looked  intently  at  it. \\n\\n‘There  are  evil  things  written  on  this  hilt,’  he  said;  ‘though \\nmaybe  your  eyes  cannot  see  them.  Keep  it,  Aragorn,  till  we \\nreach  the  house  of  Elrond!  But  be  wary,  and  handle  it  as  little \\nas  you  may!  Alas!  the  wounds  of  this  weapon  are  beyond  my \\nskill  to  heal.  I  will  do  what  I  can  -  but  all  the  more  do  I  urge \\nyou  now  to  go  on  without  rest.’ \\n\\nHe  searched  the  wound  on  Frodo’s  shoulder  with  his \\nfingers,  and  his  face  grew  graver,  as  if  what  he  learned  dis¬ \\nquieted  him.  But  Frodo  felt  the  chill  lessen  in  his  side  and \\narm;  a  little  warmth  crept  down  from  his  shoulder  to  his \\nhand,  and  the  pain  grew  easier.  The  dusk  of  evening  seemed \\nto  grow  lighter  about  him,  as  if  a  cloud  had  been  withdrawn. \\nHe  saw  his  friends’  faces  more  clearly  again,  and  a  measure \\nof  new  hope  and  strength  returned. \\n\\n‘You  shall  ride  my  horse,’  said  Glorfindel.  ‘I  will  shorten \\nthe  stirrups  up  to  the  saddle-skirts,  and  you  must  sit  as  tight \\nas  you  can.  But  you  need  not  fear:  my  horse  will  not  let  any \\nrider  fall  that  I  command  him  to  bear.  His  pace  is  light  and \\nsmooth;  and  if  danger  presses  too  near,  he  will  bear  you  away \\nwith  a  speed  that  even  the  black  steeds  of  the  enemy  cannot \\nrival.’ \\n\\n‘No,  he  will  not!’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  shall  not  ride  him,  if  I  am \\nto  be  carried  off  to  Rivendell  or  anywhere  else,  leaving  my \\nfriends  behind  in  danger.’ \\n\\nGlorfindel  smiled.  ‘I  doubt  very  much,’  he  said,  ‘if  your \\n\\n\\n276 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nfriends  would  be  in  danger  if  you  were  not  with  them!  The \\npursuit  would  follow  you  and  leave  us  in  peace,  I  think.  It  is \\nyou,  Frodo,  and  that  which  you  bear  that  brings  us  all  in \\nperil.’ \\n\\nTo  that  Frodo  had  no  answer,  and  he  was  persuaded  to \\nmount  Glorfindel’s  white  horse.  The  pony  was  laden  instead \\nwith  a  great  part  of  the  others’  burdens,  so  that  they  now \\nmarched  lighter,  and  for  a  time  made  good  speed;  but  the \\nhobbits  began  to  find  it  hard  to  keep  up  with  the  swift  tireless \\nfeet  of  the  Elf.  On  he  led  them,  into  the  mouth  of  darkness, \\nand  still  on  under  the  deep  clouded  night.  There  was  neither \\nstar  nor  moon.  Not  until  the  grey  of  dawn  did  he  allow  them \\nto  halt.  Pippin,  Merry,  and  Sam  were  by  that  time  nearly \\nasleep  on  their  stumbling  legs;  and  even  Strider  seemed  by \\nthe  sag  of  his  shoulders  to  be  weary.  Frodo  sat  upon  the  horse \\nin  a  dark  dream. \\n\\nThey  cast  themselves  down  in  the  heather  a  few  yards \\nfrom  the  road-side,  and  fell  asleep  immediately.  They  seemed \\nhardly  to  have  closed  their  eyes  when  Glorfindel,  who  had \\nset  himself  to  watch  while  they  slept,  awoke  them  again.  The \\nsun  had  now  climbed  far  into  the  morning,  and  the  clouds \\nand  mists  of  the  night  were  gone. \\n\\n‘Drink  this!’  said  Glorfindel  to  them,  pouring  for  each  in \\nturn  a  little  liquor  from  his  silver-studded  flask  of  leather.  It \\nwas  clear  as  spring  water  and  had  no  taste,  and  it  did  not  feel \\neither  cool  or  warm  in  the  mouth;  but  strength  and  vigour \\nseemed  to  flow  into  all  their  limbs  as  they  drank  it.  Eaten \\nafter  that  draught  the  stale  bread  and  dried  fruit  (which  was \\nnow  all  that  they  had  left)  seemed  to  satisfy  their  hunger \\nbetter  than  many  a  good  breakfast  in  the  Shire  had  done. \\n\\nThey  had  rested  rather  less  than  five  hours  when  they  took \\nto  the  Road  again.  Glorfindel  still  urged  them  on,  and  only \\nallowed  two  brief  halts  during  the  day’s  march.  In  this  way \\nthey  covered  almost  twenty  miles  before  nightfall,  and  came \\nto  a  point  where  the  Road  bent  right  and  ran  down  towards \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD \\n\\n\\n277 \\n\\n\\nthe  bottom  of  the  valley,  now  making  straight  for  the  Bruinen. \\nSo  far  there  had  been  no  sign  or  sound  of  pursuit  that  the \\nhobbits  could  see  or  hear;  but  often  Glorfindel  would  halt \\nand  listen  for  a  moment,  if  they  lagged  behind,  and  a  look  of \\nanxiety  clouded  his  face.  Once  or  twice  he  spoke  to  Strider \\nin  the  elf-tongue. \\n\\nBut  however  anxious  their  guides  might  be,  it  was  plain \\nthat  the  hobbits  could  go  no  further  that  night.  They  were \\nstumbling  along  dizzy  with  weariness,  and  unable  to  think  of \\nanything  but  their  feet  and  legs.  Frodo’s  pain  had  redoubled, \\nand  during  the  day  things  about  him  faded  to  shadows  of \\nghostly  grey.  Fie  almost  welcomed  the  coming  of  night,  for \\nthen  the  world  seemed  less  pale  and  empty. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  were  still  weary,  when  they  set  out  again  early \\nnext  morning.  There  were  many  miles  yet  to  go  between \\nthem  and  the  Ford,  and  they  hobbled  forward  at  the  best \\npace  they  could  manage. \\n\\n‘Our  peril  will  be  greatest  just  ere  we  reach  the  river,’  said \\nGlorfindel;  ‘for  my  heart  warns  me  that  the  pursuit  is  now \\nswift  behind  us,  and  other  danger  may  be  waiting  by  the \\nFord.’ \\n\\nThe  Road  was  still  running  steadily  downhill,  and  there \\nwas  now  in  places  much  grass  at  either  side,  in  which  the \\nhobbits  walked  when  they  could,  to  ease  their  tired  feet.  In \\nthe  late  afternoon  they  came  to  a  place  where  the  Road  went \\nsuddenly  under  the  dark  shadow  of  tall  pine-trees,  and  then \\nplunged  into  a  deep  cutting  with  steep  moist  walls  of  red \\nstone.  Echoes  ran  along  as  they  hurried  forward;  and  there \\nseemed  to  be  a  sound  of  many  footfalls  following  their  own. \\nAll  at  once,  as  if  through  a  gate  of  light,  the  Road  ran  out \\nagain  from  the  end  of  the  tunnel  into  the  open.  There  at  the \\nbottom  of  a  sharp  incline  they  saw  before  them  a  long  flat \\nmile,  and  beyond  that  the  Ford  of  Rivendell.  On  the  further \\nside  was  a  steep  brown  bank,  threaded  by  a  winding  path; \\nand  behind  that  the  tall  mountains  climbed,  shoulder  above \\nshoulder,  and  peak  beyond  peak,  into  the  fading  sky. \\n\\n\\n278 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nThere  was  still  an  echo  as  of  following  feet  in  the  cutting \\nbehind  them;  a  rushing  noise  as  if  a  wind  were  rising  and \\npouring  through  the  branches  of  the  pines.  One  moment \\nGlorfmdel  turned  and  listened,  then  he  sprang  forward  with \\na  loud  cry. \\n\\n‘Fly!’  he  called.  ‘Fly!  The  enemy  is  upon  us!’ \\n\\nThe  white  horse  leaped  forward.  The  hobbits  ran  down \\nthe  slope.  Glorfmdel  and  Strider  followed  as  rearguard.  They \\nwere  only  half  way  across  the  flat,  when  suddenly  there  was \\na  noise  of  horses  galloping.  Out  of  the  gate  in  the  trees  that \\nthey  had  just  left  rode  a  Black  Rider.  He  reined  his  horse  in, \\nand  halted,  swaying  in  his  saddle.  Another  followed  him,  and \\nthen  another;  then  again  two  more. \\n\\n‘Ride  forward!  Ride!’  cried  Glorfindel  to  Frodo. \\n\\nHe  did  not  obey  at  once,  for  a  strange  reluctance  seized \\nhim.  Checking  the  horse  to  a  walk,  he  turned  and  looked \\nback.  The  Riders  seemed  to  sit  upon  their  great  steeds  like \\nthreatening  statues  upon  a  hill,  dark  and  solid,  while  all  the \\nwoods  and  land  about  them  receded  as  if  into  a  mist.  Sud¬ \\ndenly  he  knew  in  his  heart  that  they  were  silently  command¬ \\ning  him  to  wait.  Then  at  once  fear  and  hatred  awoke  in  him. \\nHis  hand  left  the  bridle  and  gripped  the  hilt  of  his  sword,  and \\nwith  a  red  flash  he  drew  it. \\n\\n‘Ride  on!  Ride  on!’  cried  Glorfmdel,  and  then  loud  and \\nclear  he  called  to  the  horse  in  the  elf-tongue:  now  lim,  now \\nlim,  Asfaloth! \\n\\nAt  once  the  white  horse  sprang  away  and  sped  like  the \\nwind  along  the  last  lap  of  the  Road.  At  the  same  moment  the \\nblack  horses  leaped  down  the  hill  in  pursuit,  and  from \\nthe  Riders  came  a  terrible  cry,  such  as  Frodo  had  heard  filling \\nthe  woods  with  horror  in  the  Eastfarthing  far  away.  It  was \\nanswered;  and  to  the  dismay  of  Frodo  and  his  friends  out \\nfrom  the  trees  and  rocks  away  on  the  left  four  other  Riders \\ncame  flying.  Two  rode  towards  Frodo;  two  galloped  madly \\ntowards  the  Ford  to  cut  off  his  escape.  They  seemed  to  him \\nto  run  like  the  wind  and  to  grow  swiftly  larger  and  darker,  as \\ntheir  courses  converged  with  his. \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD \\n\\n\\n279 \\n\\n\\nFrodo  looked  back  for  a  moment  over  his  shoulder.  He \\ncould  no  longer  see  his  friends.  The  Riders  behind  were \\nfalling  back:  even  their  great  steeds  were  no  match  in  speed \\nfor  the  white  elf-horse  of  Glorfindel.  He  looked  forward \\nagain,  and  hope  faded.  There  seemed  no  chance  of  reaching \\nthe  Ford  before  he  was  cut  off  by  the  others  that  had  lain  in \\nambush.  He  could  see  them  clearly  now:  they  appeared  to \\nhave  cast  aside  their  hoods  and  black  cloaks,  and  they  were \\nrobed  in  white  and  grey.  Swords  were  naked  in  their  pale \\nhands;  helms  were  on  their  heads.  Their  cold  eyes  glittered, \\nand  they  called  to  him  with  fell  voices. \\n\\nFear  now  filled  all  Frodo’s  mind.  He  thought  no  longer  of \\nhis  sword.  No  cry  came  from  him.  He  shut  his  eyes  and  clung \\nto  the  horse’s  mane.  The  wind  whistled  in  his  ears,  and  the \\nbells  upon  the  harness  rang  wild  and  shrill.  A  breath  of  deadly \\ncold  pierced  him  like  a  spear,  as  with  a  last  spurt,  like  a  flash \\nof  white  fire,  the  elf-horse  speeding  as  if  on  wings,  passed \\nright  before  the  face  of  the  foremost  Rider. \\n\\nFrodo  heard  the  splash  of  water.  It  foamed  about  his  feet. \\nHe  felt  the  quick  heave  and  surge  as  the  horse  left  the  river \\nand  struggled  up  the  stony  path.  He  was  climbing  the  steep \\nbank.  He  was  across  the  Ford. \\n\\nBut  the  pursuers  were  close  behind.  At  the  top  of  the \\nbank  the  horse  halted  and  turned  about  neighing  fiercely. \\nThere  were  Nine  Riders  at  the  water’s  edge  below,  and \\nFrodo’s  spirit  quailed  before  the  threat  of  their  uplifted  faces. \\nHe  knew  of  nothing  that  would  prevent  them  from  crossing \\nas  easily  as  he  had  done;  and  he  felt  that  it  was  useless  to \\ntry  to  escape  over  the  long  uncertain  path  from  the  Ford  to \\nthe  edge  of  Rivendell,  if  once  the  Riders  crossed.  In  any \\ncase  he  felt  that  he  was  commanded  urgently  to  halt.  Hatred \\nagain  stirred  in  him,  but  he  had  no  longer  the  strength  to \\nrefuse. \\n\\nSuddenly  the  foremost  Rider  spurred  his  horse  forward.  It \\nchecked  at  the  water  and  reared  up.  With  a  great  effort  Frodo \\nsat  upright  and  brandished  his  sword. \\n\\n‘Go  back!’  he  cried.  ‘Go  back  to  the  Land  of  Mordor,  and \\n\\n\\n280 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nfollow  me  no  more!’  His  voice  sounded  thin  and  shrill  in  his \\nown  ears.  The  Riders  halted,  but  Frodo  had  not  the  power \\nof  Bombadil.  His  enemies  laughed  at  him  with  a  harsh  and \\nchilling  laughter.  ‘Come  back!  Come  back!’  they  called.  ‘To \\nMordor  we  will  take  you!’ \\n\\n‘Go  back!’  he  whispered. \\n\\n‘The  Ring!  The  Ring!’  they  cried  with  deadly  voices;  and \\nimmediately  their  leader  urged  his  horse  forward  into  the \\nwater,  followed  closely  by  two  others. \\n\\n‘By  Elbereth  and  Luthien  the  Fair,’  said  Frodo  with  a  last \\neffort,  lifting  up  his  sword,  ‘you  shall  have  neither  the  Ring \\nnor  me!’ \\n\\nThen  the  leader,  who  was  now  half  across  the  Ford,  stood \\nup  menacing  in  his  stirrups,  and  raised  up  his  hand.  Frodo \\nwas  stricken  dumb.  He  felt  his  tongue  cleave  to  his  mouth, \\nand  his  heart  labouring.  His  sword  broke  and  fell  out  of \\nhis  shaking  hand.  The  elf-horse  reared  and  snorted.  The \\nforemost  of  the  black  horses  had  almost  set  foot  upon  the \\nshore. \\n\\nAt  that  moment  there  came  a  roaring  and  a  rushing:  a  noise \\nof  loud  waters  rolling  many  stones.  Dimly  Frodo  saw  the \\nriver  below  him  rise,  and  down  along  its  course  there  came  a \\nplumed  cavalry  of  waves.  White  flames  seemed  to  Frodo  to \\nflicker  on  their  crests,  and  he  half  fancied  that  he  saw  amid \\nthe  water  white  riders  upon  white  horses  with  frothing \\nmanes.  The  three  Riders  that  were  still  in  the  midst  of  the \\nFord  were  overwhelmed:  they  disappeared,  buried  suddenly \\nunder  angry  foam.  Those  that  were  behind  drew  back  in \\ndismay. \\n\\nWith  his  last  failing  senses  Frodo  heard  cries,  and  it  seemed \\nto  him  that  he  saw,  beyond  the  Riders  that  hesitated  on  the \\nshore,  a  shining  figure  of  white  light;  and  behind  it  ran  small \\nshadowy  forms  waving  flames,  that  flared  red  in  the  grey  mist \\nthat  was  falling  over  the  world. \\n\\nThe  black  horses  were  filled  with  madness,  and  leaping \\nforward  in  terror  they  bore  their  riders  into  the  rushing  flood. \\nTheir  piercing  cries  were  drowned  in  the  roaring  of  the  river \\n\\n\\nFLIGHT  TO  THE  FORD \\n\\n\\n28l \\n\\n\\nas  it  carried  them  away.  Then  Frodo  felt  himself  falling,  and \\nthe  roaring  and  confusion  seemed  to  rise  and  engulf  him \\ntogether  with  his  enemies.  He  heard  and  saw  no  more. \\n\\n\\nBOOK  TWO \\n\\n\\nChapter  I \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\nFrodo  woke  and  found  himself  lying  in  bed.  At  first  he \\nthought  that  he  had  slept  late,  after  a  long  unpleasant  dream \\nthat  still  hovered  on  the  edge  of  memory.  Or  perhaps  he  had \\nbeen  ill?  But  the  ceiling  looked  strange;  it  was  flat,  and  it  had \\ndark  beams  richly  carved.  Fie  lay  a  little  while  longer  looking \\nat  patches  of  sunlight  on  the  wall,  and  listening  to  the  sound \\nof  a  waterfall. \\n\\n‘Where  am  I,  and  what  is  the  time?’  he  said  aloud  to  the \\nceiling. \\n\\n‘In  the  house  of  Elrond,  and  it  is  ten  o’clock  in  the  morn¬ \\ning,’  said  a  voice.  ‘It  is  the  morning  of  October  the  twenty- \\nfourth,  if  you  want  to  know.’ \\n\\n‘Gandalf !’  criedFrodo,  sittingup.  There  was  the  old  wizard, \\nsitting  in  a  chair  by  the  open  window. \\n\\n‘Yes,’  he  said,  ‘I  am  here.  And  you  are  lucky  to  be  here, \\ntoo,  after  all  the  absurd  things  you  have  done  since  you  left \\nhome.’ \\n\\nFrodo  lay  down  again.  He  felt  too  comfortable  and  peaceful \\nto  argue,  and  in  any  case  he  did  not  think  he  would  get  the \\nbetter  of  an  argument.  He  was  fully  awake  now,  and  the \\nmemory  of  his  journey  was  returning:  the  disastrous  ‘short \\ncut’  through  the  Old  Forest;  the  ‘accident’  at  The  Prancing \\nPony. ;  and  his  madness  in  putting  on  the  Ring  in  the  dell \\nunder  Weathertop.  While  he  was  thinking  of  all  these  things \\nand  trying  in  vain  to  bring  his  memory  down  to  his  arriving \\nin  Rivendell,  there  was  a  long  silence,  broken  only  by  the  soft \\npuffs  of  Gandalf ’s  pipe,  as  he  blew  white  smoke -rings  out  of \\nthe  window. \\n\\n‘Where’s  Sam?’  Frodo  asked  at  length.  ‘And  are  the  others \\nall  right?’ \\n\\n\\n286 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Yes,  they  are  all  safe  and  sound,’  answered  Gandalf.  ‘Sam \\nwas  here  until  I  sent  him  off  to  get  some  rest,  about  half  an \\nhour  ago.’ \\n\\n‘What  happened  at  the  Ford?’  said  Frodo.  ‘It  all  seemed \\nso  dim,  somehow;  and  it  still  does.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  it  would.  You  were  beginning  to  fade,’  answered \\nGandalf.  ‘The  wound  was  overcoming  you  at  last.  A  few \\nmore  hours  and  you  would  have  been  beyond  our  aid.  But \\nyou  have  some  strength  in  you,  my  dear  hobbit!  As  you \\nshowed  in  the  Barrow.  That  was  touch  and  go:  perhaps  the \\nmost  dangerous  moment  of  all.  I  wish  you  could  have  held \\nout  at  Weathertop.’ \\n\\n‘You  seem  to  know  a  great  deal  already,’  said  Frodo.  ‘I \\nhave  not  spoken  to  the  others  about  the  Barrow.  At  first  it \\nwas  too  horrible,  and  afterwards  there  were  other  things  to \\nthink  about.  How  do  you  know  about  it?’ \\n\\n‘You  have  talked  long  in  your  sleep,  Frodo,’  said  Gandalf \\ngently,  ‘and  it  has  not  been  hard  for  me  to  read  your  mind \\nand  memory.  Do  not  worry!  Though  I  said  “absurd”  just \\nnow,  I  did  not  mean  it.  I  think  well  of  you  -  and  of  the  others. \\nIt  is  no  small  feat  to  have  come  so  far,  and  through  such \\ndangers,  still  bearing  the  Ring.’ \\n\\n‘We  should  never  have  done  it  without  Strider,’  said  Frodo. \\n‘But  we  needed  you.  I  did  not  know  what  to  do  without  you.’ \\n\\n‘I  was  delayed,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘and  that  nearly  proved  our \\nruin.  And  yet  I  am  not  sure:  it  may  have  been  better  so.’ \\n\\n‘I  wish  you  would  tell  me  what  happened!’ \\n\\n‘All  in  good  time!  You  are  not  supposed  to  talk  or  worry \\nabout  anything  today,  by  Elrond’s  orders.’ \\n\\n‘But  talking  would  stop  me  thinking  and  wondering,  which \\nare  quite  as  tiring,’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  am  wide  awake  now,  and  I \\nremember  so  many  things  that  want  explaining.  Why  were \\nyou  delayed?  You  ought  to  tell  me  that  at  least.’ \\n\\n‘You  will  soon  hear  all  you  wish  to  know,’  said  Gandalf. \\nWe  shall  have  a  Council,  as  soon  as  you  are  well  enough.  At \\nthe  moment  I  will  only  say  that  I  was  held  captive.’ \\n\\n‘You?’  cried  Frodo. \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\n287 \\n\\n\\n‘Yes,  I,  Gandalf  the  Grey,’  said  the  wizard  solemnly. \\n‘There  are  many  powers  in  the  world,  for  good  or  for  evil. \\nSome  are  greater  than  I  am.  Against  some  I  have  not  yet  been \\nmeasured.  But  my  time  is  coming.  The  Morgul-lord  and  his \\nBlack  Riders  have  come  forth.  War  is  preparing!’ \\n\\n‘Then  you  knew  of  the  Riders  already  -  before  I  met  them?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  I  knew  of  them.  Indeed  I  spoke  of  them  once  to  you; \\nfor  the  Black  Riders  are  the  Ringwraiths,  the  Nine  Servants \\nof  the  Lord  of  the  Rings.  But  I  did  not  know  that  they  had \\narisen  again  or  I  should  have  fled  with  you  at  once.  I  heard \\nnews  of  them  only  after  I  left  you  in  June;  but  that  story  must \\nwait.  For  the  moment  we  have  been  saved  from  disaster,  by \\nAragorn.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  Frodo,  ‘it  was  Strider  that  saved  us.  Yet  I  was \\nafraid  of  him  at  first.  Sam  never  quite  trusted  him,  I  think, \\nnot  at  any  rate  until  we  met  Glorfindel.’ \\n\\nGandalf  smiled.  ‘I  have  heard  all  about  Sam,’  he  said.  ‘He \\nhas  no  more  doubts  now.’ \\n\\n‘I  am  glad,’  said  Frodo.  ‘For  I  have  become  very  fond  of \\nStrider.  Well,  fond  is  not  the  right  word.  I  mean  he  is  dear  to \\nme;  though  he  is  strange,  and  grim  at  times.  In  fact,  he \\nreminds  me  often  of  you.  I  didn’t  know  that  any  of  the  Big \\nPeople  were  like  that.  I  thought,  well,  that  they  were  just  big, \\nand  rather  stupid:  kind  and  stupid  like  Butterbur;  or  stupid \\nand  wicked  like  Bill  Ferny.  But  then  we  don’t  know  much \\nabout  Men  in  the  Shire,  except  perhaps  the  Bree-landers.’ \\n\\n‘You  don’t  know  much  even  about  them,  if  you  think  old \\nBarliman  is  stupid,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘He  is  wise  enough  on  his \\nown  ground.  He  thinks  less  than  he  talks,  and  slower;  yet  he \\ncan  see  through  a  brick  wall  in  time  (as  they  say  in  Bree). \\nBut  there  are  few  left  in  Middle-earth  like  Aragorn  son  of \\nArathorn.  The  race  of  the  Kings  from  over  the  Sea  is  nearly \\nat  an  end.  It  may  be  that  this  War  of  the  Ring  will  be  their \\nlast  adventure.’ \\n\\n‘Do  you  really  mean  that  Strider  is  one  of  the  people  of \\nthe  old  Kings?’  said  Frodo  in  wonder.  ‘I  thought  they  had  all \\nvanished  long  ago.  I  thought  he  was  only  a  Ranger.’ \\n\\n\\n288 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Only  a  Ranger!’  cried  Gandalf.  ‘My  dear  Frodo,  that  is \\njust  what  the  Rangers  are:  the  last  remnant  in  the  North  of \\nthe  great  people,  the  Men  of  the  West.  They  have  helped  me \\nbefore;  and  I  shall  need  their  help  in  the  days  to  come;  for \\nwe  have  reached  Rivendell,  but  the  Ring  is  not  yet  at  rest.’ \\n\\n‘I  suppose  not,’  said  Frodo.  ‘But  so  far  my  only  thought \\nhas  been  to  get  here;  and  I  hope  I  shan’t  have  to  go  any \\nfurther.  It  is  very  pleasant  just  to  rest.  I  have  had  a  month  of \\nexile  and  adventure,  and  I  find  that  has  been  as  much  as  I \\nwant.  ’ \\n\\nHe  fell  silent  and  shut  his  eyes.  After  a  while  he  spoke \\nagain.  ‘I  have  been  reckoning,’  he  said,  ‘and  I  can’t  bring \\nthe  total  up  to  October  the  twenty-fourth.  It  ought  to  be \\nthe  twenty-first.  We  must  have  reached  the  Ford  by  the \\ntwentieth.’ \\n\\n‘You  have  talked  and  reckoned  more  than  is  good  for  you,’ \\nsaid  Gandalf.  ‘How  do  the  side  and  shoulder  feel  now?’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know,’  Frodo  answered.  ‘They  don’t  feel  at  all: \\nwhich  is  an  improvement,  but’  -  he  made  an  effort  -  ‘I  can \\nmove  my  arm  again  a  little.  Yes,  it  is  coming  back  to  life.  It \\nis  not  cold,’  he  added,  touching  his  left  hand  with  his  right. \\n\\n‘Good!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘It  is  mending  fast.  You  will  soon  be \\nsound  again.  Elrond  has  cured  you:  he  has  tended  you  for \\ndays,  ever  since  you  were  brought  in.’ \\n\\n‘Days?’  said  Frodo. \\n\\nWell,  four  nights  and  three  days,  to  be  exact.  The  Elves \\nbrought  you  from  the  Ford  on  the  night  of  the  twentieth,  and \\nthat  is  where  you  lost  count.  We  have  been  terribly  anxious, \\nand  Sam  has  hardly  left  your  side,  day  or  night,  except  to \\nrun  messages.  Elrond  is  a  master  of  healing,  but  the  weapons \\nof  our  Enemy  are  deadly.  To  tell  you  the  truth,  I  had  very \\nlittle  hope;  for  I  suspected  that  there  was  some  fragment  of \\nthe  blade  still  in  the  closed  wound.  But  it  could  not  be  found \\nuntil  last  night.  Then  Elrond  removed  a  splinter.  It  was  deeply \\nburied,  and  it  was  working  inwards.’ \\n\\nFrodo  shuddered,  remembering  the  cruel  knife  with \\nnotched  blade  that  had  vanished  in  Strider’s  hands.  ‘Don’t \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\n289 \\n\\n\\nbe  alarmed!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘It  is  gone  now.  It  has  been  melted. \\nAnd  it  seems  that  Hobbits  fade  very  reluctantly.  I  have  known \\nstrong  warriors  of  the  Big  People  who  would  quickly  have \\nbeen  overcome  by  that  splinter,  which  you  bore  for  seventeen \\ndays.’ \\n\\n‘What  would  they  have  done  to  me?’  asked  Frodo.  ‘What \\nwere  the  Riders  trying  to  do?’ \\n\\n‘They  tried  to  pierce  your  heart  with  a  Morgul-knife  which \\nremains  in  the  wound.  If  they  had  succeeded,  you  would \\nhave  become  like  they  are,  only  weaker  and  under  their  com¬ \\nmand.  You  would  have  become  a  wraith  under  the  dominion \\nof  the  Dark  Lord;  and  he  would  have  tormented  you  for \\ntrying  to  keep  his  Ring,  if  any  greater  torment  were  possible \\nthan  being  robbed  of  it  and  seeing  it  on  his  hand.’ \\n\\n‘Thank  goodness  I  did  not  realize  the  horrible  danger!’  said \\nFrodo  faintly.  ‘I  was  mortally  afraid,  of  course;  but  if  I  had \\nknown  more,  I  should  not  have  dared  even  to  move.  It  is  a \\nmarvel  that  I  escaped!’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  fortune  or  fate  have  helped  you,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘not \\nto  mention  courage.  For  your  heart  was  not  touched,  and \\nonly  your  shoulder  was  pierced;  and  that  was  because  you \\nresisted  to  the  last.  But  it  was  a  terribly  narrow  shave,  so  to \\nspeak.  You  were  in  gravest  peril  while  you  wore  the  Ring,  for \\nthen  you  were  half  in  the  wraith-world  yourself,  and  they \\nmight  have  seized  you.  You  could  see  them,  and  they  could \\nsee  you.’ \\n\\n‘I  know,’  said  Frodo.  ‘They  were  terrible  to  behold!  But \\nwhy  could  we  all  see  their  horses?’ \\n\\n‘Because  they  are  real  horses;  just  as  the  black  robes  are \\nreal  robes  that  they  wear  to  give  shape  to  their  nothingness \\nwhen  they  have  dealings  with  the  living.’ \\n\\n‘Then  why  do  these  black  horses  endure  such  riders?  All \\nother  animals  are  terrified  when  they  draw  near,  even  the \\nelf-horse  of  Glorhndel.  The  dogs  howl  and  the  geese  scream \\nat  them.’ \\n\\n‘Because  these  horses  are  born  and  bred  to  the  service  of \\nthe  Dark  Lord  in  Mordor.  Not  all  his  servants  and  chattels \\n\\n\\n290  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nare  wraiths!  There  are  ores  and  trolls,  there  are  wargs  and \\nwerewolves;  and  there  have  been  and  still  are  many  Men, \\nwarriors  and  kings,  that  walk  alive  under  the  Sun,  and  yet  are \\nunder  his  sway.  And  their  number  is  growing  daily.’ \\n\\n‘What  about  Rivendell  and  the  Elves?  Is  Rivendell  safe?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  at  present,  until  all  else  is  conquered.  The  Elves  may \\nfear  the  Dark  Lord,  and  they  may  fly  before  him,  but  never \\nagain  will  they  listen  to  him  or  serve  him.  And  here  in  Riven¬ \\ndell  there  live  still  some  of  his  chief  foes:  the  Elven-wise,  lords \\nof  the  Eldar  from  beyond  the  furthest  seas.  They  do  not  fear \\nthe  Ringwraiths,  for  those  who  have  dwelt  in  the  Blessed \\nRealm  live  at  once  in  both  worlds,  and  against  both  the  Seen \\nand  the  Unseen  they  have  great  power.’ \\n\\n‘I  thought  that  I  saw  a  white  figure  that  shone  and  did  not \\ngrow  dim  like  the  others.  Was  that  Glorfindel  then?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  you  saw  him  for  a  moment  as  he  is  upon  the  other \\nside:  one  of  the  mighty  of  the  Firstborn.  He  is  an  Elf-lord  of \\na  house  of  princes.  Indeed  there  is  a  power  in  Rivendell  to \\nwithstand  the  might  of  Mordor,  for  a  while:  and  elsewhere \\nother  powers  still  dwell.  There  is  power,  too,  of  another  kind \\nin  the  Shire.  But  all  such  places  will  soon  become  islands \\nunder  siege,  if  things  go  on  as  they  are  going.  The  Dark  Lord \\nis  putting  forth  all  his  strength. \\n\\n‘Still,’  he  said,  standing  suddenly  up  and  sticking  out  his \\nchin,  while  his  beard  went  stiff  and  straight  like  bristling  wire, \\n‘we  must  keep  up  our  courage.  You  will  soon  be  well,  if  I  do \\nnot  talk  you  to  death.  You  are  in  Rivendell,  and  you  need \\nnot  worry  about  anything  for  the  present.’ \\n\\n‘I  haven’t  any  courage  to  keep  up,’  said  Frodo,  ‘but  I  am \\nnot  worried  at  the  moment.  Just  give  me  news  of  my  friends, \\nand  tell  me  the  end  of  the  affair  at  the  Ford,  as  I  keep  on \\nasking,  and  I  shall  be  content  for  the  present.  After  that  I \\nshall  have  another  sleep,  I  think;  but  I  shan’t  be  able  to  close \\nmy  eyes  until  you  have  finished  the  story  for  me.’ \\n\\nGandalf  moved  his  chair  to  the  bedside  and  took  a  good \\nlook  at  Frodo.  The  colour  had  come  back  to  his  face,  and  his \\neyes  were  clear,  and  fully  awake  and  aware.  He  was  smiling, \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\n291 \\n\\n\\nand  there  seemed  to  be  little  wrong  with  him.  But  to  the \\nwizard’s  eye  there  was  a  faint  change,  just  a  hint  as  it  were  of \\ntransparency,  about  him,  and  especially  about  the  left  hand \\nthat  lay  outside  upon  the  coverlet. \\n\\n‘Still  that  must  be  expected,’  said  Gandalf  to  himself.  ‘He \\nis  not  half  through  yet,  and  to  what  he  will  come  in  the  end \\nnot  even  Elrond  can  foretell.  Not  to  evil,  I  think.  He  may \\nbecome  like  a  glass  filled  with  a  clear  light  for  eyes  to  see  that \\ncan.’ \\n\\n‘You  look  splendid,’  he  said  aloud.  ‘I  will  risk  a  brief  tale \\nwithout  consulting  Elrond.  But  quite  brief,  mind  you,  and \\nthen  you  must  sleep  again.  This  is  what  happened,  as  far  as \\nI  can  gather.  The  Riders  made  straight  for  you,  as  soon  as \\nyou  fled.  They  did  not  need  the  guidance  of  their  horses  any \\nlonger:  you  had  become  visible  to  them,  being  already  on  the \\nthreshold  of  their  world.  And  also  the  Ring  drew  them.  Your \\nfriends  sprang  aside,  off  the  road,  or  they  would  have  been \\nridden  down.  They  knew  that  nothing  could  save  you,  if  the \\nwhite  horse  could  not.  The  Riders  were  too  swift  to  over¬ \\ntake,  and  too  many  to  oppose.  On  foot  even  Glorfindel  and \\nAragorn  together  could  not  withstand  all  the  Nine  at  once. \\n\\n‘When  the  Ringwraiths  swept  by,  your  friends  ran  up \\nbehind.  Close  to  the  Ford  there  is  a  small  hollow  beside  the \\nroad  masked  by  a  few  stunted  trees.  There  they  hastily \\nkindled  fire;  for  Glorfindel  knew  that  a  flood  would  come \\ndown,  if  the  Riders  tried  to  cross,  and  then  he  would  have  to \\ndeal  with  any  that  were  left  on  his  side  of  the  river.  The \\nmoment  the  flood  appeared,  he  rushed  out,  followed  by \\nAragorn  and  the  others  with  flaming  brands.  Caught  between \\nfire  and  water,  and  seeing  an  Elf-lord  revealed  in  his  wrath, \\nthey  were  dismayed,  and  their  horses  were  stricken  with  mad¬ \\nness.  Three  were  carried  away  by  the  first  assault  of  the  flood; \\nthe  others  were  now  hurled  into  the  water  by  their  horses  and \\noverwhelmed.’ \\n\\n‘And  is  that  the  end  of  the  Black  Riders?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘No,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Their  horses  must  have  perished, \\nand  without  them  they  are  crippled.  But  the  Ringwraiths \\n\\n\\n292  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nthemselves  cannot  be  so  easily  destroyed.  However,  there  is \\nnothing  more  to  fear  from  them  at  present.  Your  friends \\ncrossed  after  the  flood  had  passed  and  they  found  you  lying \\non  your  face  at  the  top  of  the  bank,  with  a  broken  sword \\nunder  you.  The  horse  was  standing  guard  beside  you.  You \\nwere  pale  and  cold,  and  they  feared  that  you  were  dead,  or \\nworse.  Elrond’s  folk  met  them,  carrying  you  slowly  towards \\nRivendell.’ \\n\\n‘Who  made  the  flood?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Elrond  commanded  it,’  answered  Gandalf.  ‘The  river  of \\nthis  valley  is  under  his  power,  and  it  will  rise  in  anger  when \\nhe  has  great  need  to  bar  the  Ford.  As  soon  as  the  captain  of \\nthe  Ringwraiths  rode  into  the  water  the  flood  was  released. \\nIf  I  may  say  so,  I  added  a  few  touches  of  my  own:  you  may \\nnot  have  noticed,  but  some  of  the  waves  took  the  form  of \\ngreat  white  horses  with  shining  white  riders;  and  there  were \\nmany  rolling  and  grinding  boulders.  For  a  moment  I  was \\nafraid  that  we  had  let  loose  too  fierce  a  wrath,  and  the  flood \\nwould  get  out  of  hand  and  wash  you  all  away.  There  is  great \\nvigour  in  the  waters  that  come  down  from  the  snows  of  the \\nMisty  Mountains.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  it  all  comes  back  to  me  now,’  said  Frodo:  ‘the  tremen¬ \\ndous  roaring.  I  thought  I  was  drowning,  with  my  friends  and \\nenemies  and  all.  But  now  we  are  safe!’ \\n\\nGandalf  looked  quickly  at  Frodo,  but  he  had  shut  his  eyes. \\n‘Yes,  you  are  all  safe  for  the  present.  Soon  there  will  be \\nfeasting  and  merrymaking  to  celebrate  the  victory  at  the  Ford \\nof  Bruinen,  and  you  will  all  be  there  in  places  of  honour.’ \\n\\n‘Splendid!’  said  Frodo.  ‘It  is  wonderful  that  Elrond,  and \\nGlorfindel  and  such  great  lords,  not  to  mention  Strider, \\nshould  take  so  much  trouble  and  show  me  so  much  kindness.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  there  are  many  reasons  why  they  should,’  said \\nGandalf,  smiling.  ‘I  am  one  good  reason.  The  Ring  is  another: \\nyou  are  the  Ring-bearer.  And  you  are  the  heir  of  Bilbo,  the \\nRing-finder.’ \\n\\n‘Dear  Bilbo!’  said  Frodo  sleepily.  ‘I  wonder  where  he  is.  I \\nwish  he  was  here  and  could  hear  all  about  it.  It  would  have \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS  293 \\n\\nmade  him  laugh.  The  cow  jumped  over  the  Moon!  And  the \\npoor  old  troll!’  With  that  he  fell  fast  asleep. \\n\\nFrodo  was  now  safe  in  the  Last  Homely  House  east  of  the \\nSea.  That  house  was,  as  Bilbo  had  long  ago  reported,  ‘a \\nperfect  house,  whether  you  like  food  or  sleep  or  story-telling \\nor  singing,  or  just  sitting  and  thinking  best,  or  a  pleasant \\nmixture  of  them  all’.  Merely  to  be  there  was  a  cure  for  weari¬ \\nness,  fear,  and  sadness. \\n\\nAs  the  evening  drew  on,  Frodo  woke  up  again,  and  he \\nfound  that  he  no  longer  felt  in  need  of  rest  or  sleep,  but  had \\na  mind  for  food  and  drink,  and  probably  for  singing  and \\nstory-telling  afterwards.  He  got  out  of  bed  and  discovered \\nthat  his  arm  was  already  nearly  as  useful  again  as  it  ever  had \\nbeen.  He  found  laid  ready  clean  garments  of  green  cloth  that \\nfitted  him  excellently.  Looking  in  a  mirror  he  was  startled  to \\nsee  a  much  thinner  reflection  of  himself  than  he  remembered: \\nit  looked  remarkably  like  the  young  nephew  of  Bilbo  who \\nused  to  go  tramping  with  his  uncle  in  the  Shire;  but  the  eyes \\nlooked  out  at  him  thoughtfully. \\n\\n‘Yes,  you  have  seen  a  thing  or  two  since  you  last  peeped \\nout  of  a  looking-glass,’  he  said  to  his  reflection.  ‘But  now  for \\na  merry  meeting!’  He  stretched  out  his  arms  and  whistled  a \\ntune. \\n\\nAt  that  moment  there  was  a  knock  on  the  door,  and  Sam \\ncame  in.  He  ran  to  Frodo  and  took  his  left  hand,  awkwardly \\nand  shyly.  He  stroked  it  gently  and  then  he  blushed  and \\nturned  hastily  away. \\n\\n‘Hullo,  Sam!’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘It’s  warm!’  said  Sam.  ‘Meaning  your  hand,  Mr.  Frodo.  It \\nhas  felt  so  cold  through  the  long  nights.  But  glory  and  trum¬ \\npets!’  he  cried,  turning  round  again  with  shining  eyes  and \\ndancing  on  the  floor.  ‘It’s  fine  to  see  you  up  and  yourself \\nagain,  sir!  Gandalf  asked  me  to  come  and  see  if  you  were \\nready  to  come  down,  and  I  thought  he  was  joking.’ \\n\\n‘I  am  ready,’  said  Frodo.  ‘Let’s  go  and  look  for  the  rest  of \\nthe  party!’ \\n\\n\\n294 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘I  can  take  you  to  them,  sir,’  said  Sam.  ‘It’s  a  big  house \\nthis,  and  very  peculiar.  Always  a  bit  more  to  discover,  and \\nno  knowing  what  you’ll  find  round  a  corner.  And  Elves,  sir! \\nElves  here,  and  Elves  there!  Some  like  lungs,  terrible  and \\nsplendid;  and  some  as  merry  as  children.  And  the  music  and \\nthe  singing  -  not  that  I  have  had  the  time  or  the  heart  for \\nmuch  listening  since  we  got  here.  But  I’m  getting  to  know \\nsome  of  the  ways  of  the  place.’ \\n\\n‘I  know  what  you  have  been  doing,  Sam,’  said  Frodo, \\ntaking  his  arm.  ‘But  you  shall  be  merry  tonight,  and  listen  to \\nyour  heart’s  content.  Come  on,  guide  me  round  the  corners!’ \\n\\nSam  led  him  along  several  passages  and  down  many  steps \\nand  out  into  a  high  garden  above  the  steep  bank  of  the  river. \\nHe  found  his  friends  sitting  in  a  porch  on  the  side  of  the \\nhouse  looking  east.  Shadows  had  fallen  in  the  valley  below, \\nbut  there  was  still  a  light  on  the  faces  of  the  mountains  far \\nabove.  The  air  was  warm.  The  sound  of  running  and  falling \\nwater  was  loud,  and  the  evening  was  filled  with  a  faint  scent \\nof  trees  and  flowers,  as  if  summer  still  lingered  in  Elrond’s \\ngardens. \\n\\n‘Hurray!’  cried  Pippin,  springing  up.  ‘Here  is  our  noble \\ncousin!  Make  way  for  Frodo,  Lord  of  the  Ring!’ \\n\\n‘Hush!’  said  Gandalf  from  the  shadows  at  the  back  of  the \\nporch.  ‘Evil  things  do  not  come  into  this  valley;  but  all  the \\nsame  we  should  not  name  them.  The  Lord  of  the  Ring  is  not \\nFrodo,  but  the  master  of  the  Dark  Tower  of  Mordor,  whose \\npower  is  again  stretching  out  over  the  world.  We  are  sitting \\nin  a  fortress.  Outside  it  is  getting  dark.’ \\n\\n‘Gandalf  has  been  saying  many  cheerful  things  like  that,’ \\nsaid  Pippin.  ‘He  thinks  I  need  keeping  in  order.  But  it  seems \\nimpossible,  somehow,  to  feel  gloomy  or  depressed  in  this \\nplace.  I  feel  I  could  sing,  if  I  knew  the  right  song  for  the \\noccasion.’ \\n\\n‘I  feel  like  singing  myself,’  laughed  Frodo.  ‘Though  at  the \\nmoment  I  feel  more  like  eating  and  drinking.’ \\n\\n‘That  will  soon  be  cured,’  said  Pippin.  ‘You  have  shown \\nyour  usual  cunning  in  getting  up  just  in  time  for  a  meal.’ \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\n295 \\n\\n\\n‘More  than  a  meal!  A  feast!’  said  Merry.  ‘As  soon  as \\nGandalf  reported  that  you  were  recovered,  the  preparations \\nbegan.’  He  had  hardly  finished  speaking  when  they  were \\nsummoned  to  the  hall  by  the  ringing  of  many  bells. \\n\\nThe  hall  of  Elrond’s  house  was  filled  with  folk:  Elves  for \\nthe  most  part,  though  there  were  a  few  guests  of  other  sorts. \\nElrond,  as  was  his  custom,  sat  in  a  great  chair  at  the  end  of \\nthe  long  table  upon  the  dais;  and  next  to  him  on  the  one  side \\nsat  Glorfindel,  on  the  other  side  sat  Gandalf. \\n\\nFrodo  looked  at  them  in  wonder;  for  he  had  never  before \\nseen  Elrond,  of  whom  so  many  tales  spoke;  and  as  they \\nsat  upon  his  right  hand  and  his  left,  Glorfindel,  and  even \\nGandalf,  whom  he  thought  he  knew  so  well,  were  revealed \\nas  lords  of  dignity  and  power. \\n\\nGandalf  was  shorter  in  stature  than  the  other  two;  but  his \\nlong  white  hair,  his  sweeping  silver  beard,  and  his  broad \\nshoulders,  made  him  look  like  some  wise  king  of  ancient \\nlegend.  In  his  aged  face  under  great  snowy  brows  his  dark \\neyes  were  set  like  coals  that  could  leap  suddenly  into  fire. \\n\\nGlorfindel  was  tall  and  straight;  his  hair  was  of  shining \\ngold,  his  face  fair  and  young  and  fearless  and  full  of  joy;  his \\neyes  were  bright  and  keen,  and  his  voice  like  music;  on  his \\nbrow  sat  wisdom,  and  in  his  hand  was  strength. \\n\\nThe  face  of  Elrond  was  ageless,  neither  old  nor  young, \\nthough  in  it  was  written  the  memory  of  many  things  both \\nglad  and  sorrowful.  His  hair  was  dark  as  the  shadows  of \\ntwilight,  and  upon  it  was  set  a  circlet  of  silver;  his  eyes  were \\ngrey  as  a  clear  evening,  and  in  them  was  a  light  like  the  light \\nof  stars.  Venerable  he  seemed  as  a  king  crowned  with  many \\nwinters,  and  yet  hale  as  a  tried  warrior  in  the  fulness  of  his \\nstrength.  He  was  the  Lord  of  Rivendell  and  mighty  among \\nboth  Elves  and  Men. \\n\\nIn  the  middle  of  the  table,  against  the  woven  cloths  upon \\nthe  wall,  there  was  a  chair  under  a  canopy,  and  there  sat  a \\nlady  fair  to  look  upon,  and  so  like  was  she  in  form  of  woman¬ \\nhood  to  Elrond  that  Frodo  guessed  that  she  was  one  of  his \\n\\n\\n296  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nclose  kindred.  Young  she  was  and  yet  not  so.  The  braids  of \\nher  dark  hair  were  touched  by  no  frost;  her  white  arms  and \\nclear  face  were  flawless  and  smooth,  and  the  light  of  stars \\nwas  in  her  bright  eyes,  grey  as  a  cloudless  night;  yet  queenly \\nshe  looked,  and  thought  and  knowledge  were  in  her  glance, \\nas  of  one  who  has  known  many  things  that  the  years  bring. \\nAbove  her  brow  her  head  was  covered  with  a  cap  of  silver \\nlace  netted  with  small  gems,  glittering  white;  but  her  soft  grey \\nraiment  had  no  ornament  save  a  girdle  of  leaves  wrought  in \\nsilver. \\n\\nSo  it  was  that  Frodo  saw  her  whom  few  mortals  had  yet \\nseen;  Arwen,  daughter  of  Elrond,  in  whom  it  was  said  that \\nthe  likeness  of  Luthien  had  come  on  earth  again;  and  she  was \\ncalled  Undomiel,  for  she  was  the  Evenstar  of  her  people. \\nLong  she  had  been  in  the  land  of  her  mother’s  kin,  in  Lorien \\nbeyond  the  mountains,  and  was  but  lately  returned  to  Riven- \\ndell  to  her  father’s  house.  But  her  brothers,  Elladan  and \\nElrohir,  were  out  upon  errantry;  for  they  rode  often  far  afield \\nwith  the  Rangers  of  the  North,  forgetting  never  their  mother’s \\ntorment  in  the  dens  of  the  ores. \\n\\nSuch  loveliness  in  living  thing  Frodo  had  never  seen  before \\nnor  imagined  in  his  mind;  and  he  was  both  surprised  and \\nabashed  to  find  that  he  had  a  seat  at  Elrond’ s  table  among  all \\nthese  folk  so  high  and  fair.  Though  he  had  a  suitable  chair, \\nand  was  raised  upon  several  cushions,  he  felt  very  small,  and \\nrather  out  of  place;  but  that  feeling  quickly  passed.  The  feast \\nwas  merry  and  the  food  all  that  his  hunger  could  desire.  It \\nwas  some  time  before  he  looked  about  him  again  or  even \\nturned  to  his  neighbours. \\n\\nHe  looked  first  for  his  friends.  Sam  had  begged  to  be \\nallowed  to  wait  on  his  master,  but  had  been  told  that  for  this \\ntime  he  was  a  guest  of  honour.  Frodo  could  see  him  now, \\nsitting  with  Pippin  and  Merry  at  the  upper  end  of  one  of \\nthe  side-tables  close  to  the  dais.  He  could  see  no  sign  of \\nStrider. \\n\\nNext  to  Frodo  on  his  right  sat  a  dwarf  of  important  appear¬ \\nance,  richly  dressed.  His  beard,  very  long  and  forked,  was \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\n297 \\n\\n\\nwhite,  nearly  as  white  as  the  snow-white  cloth  of  his  garments. \\nHe  wore  a  silver  belt,  and  round  his  neck  hung  a  chain  of \\nsilver  and  diamonds.  Frodo  stopped  eating  to  look  at  him. \\n\\n‘Welcome  and  well  met!’  said  the  dwarf,  turning  towards \\nhim.  Then  he  actually  rose  from  his  seat  and  bowed.  ‘Gloin \\nat  your  service,’  he  said,  and  bowed  still  lower. \\n\\n‘Frodo  Baggins  at  your  service  and  your  family’s,’  said \\nFrodo  correctly,  rising  in  surprise  and  scattering  his  cushions. \\n‘Am  I  right  in  guessing  that  you  are  the  Gloin,  one  of  the \\ntwelve  companions  of  the  great  Thorin  Oakenshield?’ \\n\\n‘Quite  right,’  answered  the  dwarf,  gathering  up  the \\ncushions  and  courteously  assisting  Frodo  back  into  his  seat. \\n‘And  I  do  not  ask,  for  I  have  already  been  told  that  you \\nare  the  kinsman  and  adopted  heir  of  our  friend  Bilbo  the \\nrenowned.  Allow  me  to  congratulate  you  on  your  recovery.’ \\n\\n‘Thank  you  very  much,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘You  have  had  some  very  strange  adventures,  I  hear,’  said \\nGloin.  ‘I  wonder  greatly  what  brings  four  hobbits  on  so  long \\na  journey.  Nothing  like  it  has  happened  since  Bilbo  came \\nwith  us.  But  perhaps  I  should  not  inquire  too  closely,  since \\nElrond  and  Gandalf  do  not  seem  disposed  to  talk  of  this?’ \\n\\n‘I  think  we  will  not  speak  of  it,  at  least  not  yet,’  said  Frodo \\npolitely.  He  guessed  that  even  in  Elrond’s  house  the  matter \\nof  the  Ring  was  not  one  for  casual  talk;  and  in  any  case  he \\nwished  to  forget  his  troubles  for  a  time.  ‘But  I  am  equally \\ncurious,’  he  added,  ‘to  learn  what  brings  so  important  a  dwarf \\nso  far  from  the  Lonely  Mountain.’ \\n\\nGloin  looked  at  him.  ‘If  you  have  not  heard,  I  think  we  will \\nnot  speak  yet  of  that  either.  Master  Elrond  will  summon  us \\nall  ere  long,  I  believe,  and  then  we  shall  all  hear  many  things. \\nBut  there  is  much  else  that  may  be  told.’ \\n\\nThroughout  the  rest  of  the  meal  they  talked  together,  but \\nFrodo  listened  more  than  he  spoke;  for  the  news  of  the  Shire, \\napart  from  the  Ring,  seemed  small  and  far-away  and  unim¬ \\nportant,  while  Gloin  had  much  to  tell  of  events  in  the  northern \\nregions  of  Wilderland.  Frodo  learned  that  Grimbeorn  the \\nOld,  son  of  Beorn,  was  now  the  lord  of  many  sturdy  men, \\n\\n\\n298  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nand  to  their  land  between  the  Mountains  and  Mirkwood \\nneither  ore  nor  wolf  dared  to  go. \\n\\n‘Indeed,’  said  Gloin,  ‘if  it  were  not  for  the  Beornings,  the \\npassage  from  Dale  to  Rivendell  would  long  ago  have  become \\nimpossible.  They  are  valiant  men  and  keep  open  the  High \\nPass  and  the  Ford  of  Carrock.  But  their  tolls  are  high,’  he \\nadded  with  a  shake  of  his  head;  ‘and  like  Beorn  of  old  they \\nare  not  over  fond  of  dwarves.  Still,  they  are  trusty,  and  that \\nis  much  in  these  days.  Nowhere  are  there  any  men  so  friendly \\nto  us  as  the  Men  of  Dale.  They  are  good  folic,  the  Bardings. \\nThe  grandson  of  Bard  the  Bowman  rules  them,  Brand  son \\nof  Bain  son  of  Bard.  He  is  a  strong  king,  and  his  realm  now \\nreaches  far  south  and  east  of  Esgaroth.’ \\n\\n‘And  what  of  your  own  people?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘There  is  much  to  tell,  good  and  bad,’  said  Gloin;  ‘yet  it  is \\nmostly  good:  we  have  so  far  been  fortunate,  though  we  do \\nnot  escape  the  shadow  of  these  times.  If  you  really  wish  to \\nhear  of  us,  I  will  tell  you  tidings  gladly.  But  stop  me  when \\nyou  are  weary!  Dwarves’  tongues  run  on  when  speaking  of \\ntheir  handiwork,  they  say.’ \\n\\nAnd  with  that  Gloin  embarked  on  a  long  account  of  the \\ndoings  of  the  Dwarf-kingdom.  He  was  delighted  to  have \\nfound  so  polite  a  listener;  for  Frodo  showed  no  sign  of  weari¬ \\nness  and  made  no  attempt  to  change  the  subject,  though \\nactually  he  soon  got  rather  lost  among  the  strange  names  of \\npeople  and  places  that  he  had  never  heard  of  before.  He  was \\ninterested,  however,  to  hear  that  Dain  was  still  King  under \\nthe  Mountain,  and  was  now  old  (having  passed  his  two \\nhundred  and  fiftieth  year),  venerable,  and  fabulously  rich.  Of \\nthe  ten  companions  who  had  survived  the  Battle  of  Five \\nArmies  seven  were  still  with  him:  Dwalin,  Gloin,  Dori,  Nori, \\nBifur,  Bofur,  and  Bombur.  Bombur  was  now  so  fat  that  he \\ncould  not  move  himself  from  his  couch  to  his  chair  at  table, \\nand  it  took  six  young  dwarves  to  lift  him. \\n\\n‘And  what  has  become  of  Balin  and  Ori  and  Oin?’  asked \\nFrodo. \\n\\nA  shadow  passed  over  Gloin’s  face.  ‘We  do  not  know,’  he \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\n299 \\n\\n\\nanswered.  ‘It  is  largely  on  account  of  Balin  that  I  have  come \\nto  ask  the  advice  of  those  that  dwell  in  Rivendell.  But  tonight \\nlet  us  speak  of  merrier  things!’ \\n\\nGloin  began  then  to  talk  of  the  works  of  his  people,  telling \\nFrodo  about  their  great  labours  in  Dale  and  under  the  Moun¬ \\ntain.  ‘We  have  done  well,’  he  said.  ‘But  in  metal-work  we \\ncannot  rival  our  fathers,  many  of  whose  secrets  are  lost.  We \\nmake  good  armour  and  keen  swords,  but  we  cannot  again \\nmake  mail  or  blade  to  match  those  that  were  made  before  the \\ndragon  came.  Only  in  mining  and  building  have  we  surpassed \\nthe  old  days.  You  should  see  the  waterways  of  Dale,  Frodo, \\nand  the  fountains,  and  the  pools!  You  should  see  the  stone- \\npaved  roads  of  many  colours!  And  the  halls  and  cavernous \\nstreets  under  the  earth  with  arches  carved  like  trees;  and  the \\nterraces  and  towers  upon  the  Mountain’s  sides!  Then  you \\nwould  see  that  we  have  not  been  idle.’ \\n\\n‘I  will  come  and  see  them,  if  ever  I  can,’  said  Frodo.  ‘How \\nsurprised  Bilbo  would  have  been  to  see  all  the  changes  in  the \\nDesolation  of  Smaug!’ \\n\\nGloin  looked  at  Frodo  and  smiled.  ‘You  were  very  fond  of \\nBilbo  were  you  not?’  he  asked. \\n\\n‘Yes,’  answered  Frodo.  ‘I  would  rather  see  him  than  all  the \\ntowers  and  palaces  in  the  world.’ \\n\\nAt  length  the  feast  came  to  an  end.  Elrond  and  Arwen  rose \\nand  went  down  the  hall,  and  the  company  followed  them \\nin  due  order.  The  doors  were  thrown  open,  and  they  went \\nacross  a  wide  passage  and  through  other  doors,  and  came \\ninto  a  further  hall.  In  it  were  no  tables,  but  a  bright  fire  was \\nburning  in  a  great  hearth  between  the  carven  pillars  upon \\neither  side. \\n\\nFrodo  found  himself  walking  with  Gandalf.  ‘This  is  the \\nHall  of  Fire,’  said  the  wizard.  ‘Here  you  will  hear  many  songs \\nand  tales  -  if  you  can  keep  awake.  But  except  on  high  days \\nit  usually  stands  empty  and  quiet,  and  people  come  here  who \\nwish  for  peace,  and  thought.  There  is  always  a  fire  here,  all \\nthe  year  round,  but  there  is  little  other  light.’ \\n\\n\\n300  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nAs  Elrond  entered  and  went  towards  the  seat  prepared  for \\nhim,  Elvish  minstrels  began  to  make  sweet  music.  Slowly  the \\nhall  filled,  and  Frodo  looked  with  delight  upon  the  many  fair \\nfaces  that  were  gathered  together;  the  golden  firelight  played \\nupon  them  and  shimmered  in  their  hair.  Suddenly  he  noticed, \\nnot  far  from  the  further  end  of  the  fire,  a  small  dark  figure \\nseated  on  a  stool  with  his  back  propped  against  a  pillar.  Beside \\nhim  on  the  ground  was  a  drinking-cup  and  some  bread. \\nFrodo  wondered  whether  he  was  ill  (if  people  were  ever  ill  in \\nRivendell),  and  had  been  unable  to  come  to  the  feast.  His \\nhead  seemed  sunk  in  sleep  on  his  breast,  and  a  fold  of  his \\ndark  cloak  was  drawn  over  his  face. \\n\\nElrond  went  forward  and  stood  beside  the  silent  figure. \\n‘Awake,  little  master!’  he  said,  with  a  smile.  Then,  turning  to \\nFrodo,  he  beckoned  to  him.  ‘Now  at  last  the  hour  has  come \\nthat  you  have  wished  for,  Frodo,’  he  said.  ‘Here  is  a  friend \\nthat  you  have  long  missed.’ \\n\\nThe  dark  figure  raised  its  head  and  uncovered  its  face. \\n\\n‘Bilbo!’  cried  Frodo  with  sudden  recognition,  and  he \\nsprang  forward. \\n\\n‘Hullo,  Frodo  my  lad!’  said  Bilbo.  ‘So  you  have  got  here  at \\nlast.  I  hoped  you  would  manage  it.  Well,  well!  So  all  this \\nfeasting  is  in  your  honour,  I  hear.  I  hope  you  enjoyed \\nyourself?’ \\n\\n‘Why  weren’t  you  there?’  cried  Frodo.  ‘And  why  haven’t \\nI  been  allowed  to  see  you  before?’ \\n\\n‘Because  you  were  asleep.  I  have  seen  a  good  deal  of  you. \\nI  have  sat  by  your  side  with  Sam  each  day.  But  as  for  the \\nfeast,  I  don’t  go  in  for  such  things  much  now.  And  I  had \\nsomething  else  to  do.’ \\n\\n‘What  were  you  doing?’ \\n\\n‘Why,  sitting  and  thinking.  I  do  a  lot  of  that  nowadays,  and \\nthis  is  the  best  place  to  do  it  in,  as  a  rule.  Wake  up,  indeed!’ \\nhe  said,  cocking  an  eye  at  Elrond.  There  was  a  bright  twinkle \\nin  it  and  no  sign  of  sleepiness  that  Frodo  could  see.  ‘Wake \\nup!  I  was  not  asleep,  Master  Elrond.  If  you  want  to  know, \\nyou  have  all  come  out  from  your  feast  too  soon,  and  you \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\n301 \\n\\n\\nhave  disturbed  me  -  in  the  middle  of  making  up  a  song.  I \\nwas  stuck  over  a  line  or  two,  and  was  thinking  about  them; \\nbut  now  I  don’t  suppose  I  shall  ever  get  them  right.  There \\nwill  be  such  a  deal  of  singing  that  the  ideas  will  be  driven  clean \\nout  of  my  head.  I  shall  have  to  get  my  friend  the  Dunadan  to \\nhelp  me.  Where  is  he?’ \\n\\nElrond  laughed.  ‘He  shall  be  found,’  he  said.  ‘Then  you \\ntwo  shall  go  into  a  corner  and  finish  your  task,  and  we  will \\nhear  it  and  judge  it  before  we  end  our  merrymaking.’  Messen¬ \\ngers  were  sent  to  find  Bilbo’s  friend,  though  none  knew  where \\nhe  was,  or  why  he  had  not  been  present  at  the  feast. \\n\\nIn  the  meanwhile  Frodo  and  Bilbo  sat  side  by  side,  and \\nSam  came  quickly  and  placed  himself  near  them.  They  talked \\ntogether  in  soft  voices,  oblivious  of  the  mirth  and  music  in \\nthe  hall  about  them.  Bilbo  had  not  much  to  say  of  himself. \\nWhen  he  had  left  Hobbiton  he  had  wandered  off  aimlessly, \\nalong  the  Road  or  in  the  country  on  either  side;  but  somehow \\nhe  had  steered  all  the  time  towards  Rivendell. \\n\\n‘I  got  here  without  much  adventure,’  he  said,  ‘and  after  a \\nrest  I  went  on  with  the  dwarves  to  Dale:  my  last  journey.  I \\nshan’t  travel  again.  Old  Balin  had  gone  away.  Then  I  came \\nback  here,  and  here  I  have  been.  I  have  done  this  and  that. \\nI  have  written  some  more  of  my  book.  And,  of  course,  I  make \\nup  a  few  songs.  They  sing  them  occasionally:  just  to  please \\nme,  I  think;  for,  of  course,  they  aren’t  really  good  enough  for \\nRivendell.  And  I  listen  and  I  think.  Time  doesn’t  seem  to \\npass  here:  it  just  is.  A  remarkable  place  altogether. \\n\\n‘I  hear  all  lands  of  news,  from  over  the  Mountains,  and \\nout  of  the  South,  but  hardly  anything  from  the  Shire.  I  heard \\nabout  the  Ring,  of  course.  Gandalf  has  been  here  often.  Not \\nthat  he  has  told  me  a  great  deal,  he  has  become  closer  than \\never  these  last  few  years.  The  Dunadan  has  told  me  more. \\nFancy  that  ring  of  mine  causing  such  a  disturbance!  It  is  a \\npity  that  Gandalf  did  not  find  out  more  sooner.  I  could  have \\nbrought  the  thing  here  myself  long  ago  without  so  much \\ntrouble.  I  have  thought  several  times  of  going  back  to  Hobbi¬ \\nton  for  it;  but  I  am  getting  old,  and  they  would  not  let  me: \\n\\n\\n302 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nGandalf  and  Elrond,  I  mean.  They  seemed  to  think  that  the \\nEnemy  was  looking  high  and  low  for  me,  and  would  make \\nmincemeat  of  me,  if  he  caught  me  tottering  about  in  the \\nWild. \\n\\n‘And  Gandalf  said:  “The  Ring  has  passed  on,  Bilbo.  It \\nwould  do  no  good  to  you  or  to  others,  if  you  tried  to  meddle \\nwith  it  again.”  Odd  sort  of  remark,  just  like  Gandalf.  But  he \\nsaid  he  was  looking  after  you,  so  I  let  things  be.  I  am  fright¬ \\nfully  glad  to  see  you  safe  and  sound.’  He  paused  and  looked \\nat  Frodo  doubtfully. \\n\\n‘Have  you  got  it  here?’  he  asked  in  a  whisper.  ‘I  can’t  help \\nfeeling  curious,  you  know,  after  all  I’ve  heard.  I  should  very \\nmuch  like  just  to  peep  at  it  again.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  I’ve  got  it,’  answered  Frodo,  feeling  a  strange  reluc¬ \\ntance.  ‘It  looks  just  the  same  as  ever  it  did.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  I  should  just  like  to  see  it  for  a  moment,’  said  Bilbo. \\n\\nWhen  he  had  dressed,  Frodo  found  that  while  he  slept  the \\nRing  had  been  hung  about  his  neck  on  a  new  chain,  light  but \\nstrong.  Slowly  he  drew  it  out.  Bilbo  put  out  his  hand.  But \\nFrodo  quickly  drew  back  the  Ring.  To  his  distress  and  amaze¬ \\nment  he  found  that  he  was  no  longer  looking  at  Bilbo;  a \\nshadow  seemed  to  have  fallen  between  them,  and  through \\nit  he  found  himself  eyeing  a  little  wrinkled  creature  with  a \\nhungry  face  and  bony  groping  hands.  He  felt  a  desire  to  strike \\nhim. \\n\\nThe  music  and  singing  round  them  seemed  to  falter,  and \\na  silence  fell.  Bilbo  looked  quickly  at  Frodo’s  face  and  passed \\nhis  hand  across  his  eyes.  ‘I  understand  now,’  he  said.  ‘Put  it \\naway!  I  am  sorry:  sorry  you  have  come  in  for  this  burden; \\nsorry  about  everything.  Don’t  adventures  ever  have  an  end? \\nI  suppose  not.  Someone  else  always  has  to  carry  on  the  story. \\nWell,  it  can’t  be  helped.  I  wonder  if  it’s  any  good  trying  to \\nfinish  my  book?  But  don’t  let’s  worry  about  it  now  -  let’s \\nhave  some  real  News!  Tell  me  all  about  the  Shire!’ \\n\\nFrodo  hid  the  Ring  away,  and  the  shadow  passed  leaving \\nhardly  a  shred  of  memory.  The  light  and  music  of  Rivendell \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\n303 \\n\\n\\nwas  about  him  again.  Bilbo  smiled  and  laughed  happily. \\nEvery  item  of  news  from  the  Shire  that  Frodo  could  tell  - \\naided  and  corrected  now  and  again  by  Sam  -  was  of  the \\ngreatest  interest  to  him,  from  the  felling  of  the  least  tree  to \\nthe  pranks  of  the  smallest  child  in  Hobbiton.  They  were  so \\ndeep  in  the  doings  of  the  Four  Farthings  that  they  did  not \\nnotice  the  arrival  of  a  man  clad  in  dark  green  cloth.  For  many \\nminutes  he  stood  looking  down  at  them  with  a  smile. \\n\\nSuddenly  Bilbo  looked  up.  ‘Ah,  there  you  are  at  last,  Dun- \\nadan!’  he  cried. \\n\\n‘Strider!’  said  Frodo.  ‘You  seem  to  have  a  lot  of  names.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  Strider  is  one  that  I  haven’t  heard  before,  anyway,’ \\nsaid  Bilbo.  ‘What  do  you  call  him  that  for?’ \\n\\n‘They  call  me  that  in  Bree,’  said  Strider  laughing,  ‘and  that \\nis  how  I  was  introduced  to  him.’ \\n\\n‘And  why  do  you  call  him  Dunadan?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘  The  Dunadan,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘Fie  is  often  called  that  here. \\nBut  I  thought  you  knew  enough  Elvish  at  least  to  know  dun¬ \\nadan:  Man  of  the  West,  Numenorean.  But  this  is  not  the  time \\nfor  lessons!’  He  turned  to  Strider.  Where  have  you  been,  my \\nfriend?  Why  weren’t  you  at  the  feast?  The  Lady  Arwen  was \\nthere.’ \\n\\nStrider  looked  down  at  Bilbo  gravely.  ‘I  know,’  he  said. \\n‘But  often  I  must  put  mirth  aside.  Elladan  and  Elrohir  have \\nreturned  out  of  the  Wild  unlooked-for,  and  they  had  tidings \\nthat  I  wished  to  hear  at  once.’ \\n\\nWell,  my  dear  fellow,’  said  Bilbo,  ‘now  you’ve  heard  the \\nnews,  can’t  you  spare  me  a  moment?  I  want  your  help  in \\nsomething  urgent.  Elrond  says  this  song  of  mine  is  to  be \\nfinished  before  the  end  of  the  evening,  and  I  am  stuck.  Let’s \\ngo  off  into  a  corner  and  polish  it  up!’ \\n\\nStrider  smiled.  ‘Come  then!’  he  said.  ‘Let  me  hear  it!’ \\n\\nFrodo  was  left  to  himself  for  a  while,  for  Sam  had  fallen \\nasleep.  He  was  alone  and  felt  rather  forlorn,  although  all \\nabout  him  the  folk  of  Rivendell  were  gathered.  But  those  near \\nhim  were  silent,  intent  upon  the  music  of  the  voices  and  the \\n\\n\\n304  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\ninstruments,  and  they  gave  no  heed  to  anything  else.  Frodo \\nbegan  to  listen. \\n\\nAt  first  the  beauty  of  the  melodies  and  of  the  interwoven \\nwords  in  elven-tongues,  even  though  he  understood  them \\nlittle,  held  him  in  a  spell,  as  soon  as  he  began  to  attend  to \\nthem.  Almost  it  seemed  that  the  words  took  shape,  and \\nvisions  of  far  lands  and  bright  things  that  he  had  never  yet \\nimagined  opened  out  before  him;  and  the  firelit  hall  became \\nlike  a  golden  mist  above  seas  of  foam  that  sighed  upon  the \\nmargins  of  the  world.  Then  the  enchantment  became  more \\nand  more  dreamlike,  until  he  felt  that  an  endless  river  of \\nswelling  gold  and  silver  was  flowing  over  him,  too  multitu¬ \\ndinous  for  its  pattern  to  be  comprehended;  it  became  part  of \\nthe  throbbing  air  about  him,  and  it  drenched  and  drowned \\nhim.  Swiftly  he  sank  under  its  shining  weight  into  a  deep \\nrealm  of  sleep. \\n\\nThere  he  wandered  long  in  a  dream  of  music  that  turned \\ninto  running  water,  and  then  suddenly  into  a  voice.  It  seemed \\nto  be  the  voice  of  Bilbo  chanting  verses.  Faint  at  first  and \\nthen  clearer  ran  the  words. \\n\\nEarendil  was  a  mariner \\nthat  tarried  in  Arvernien; \\nhe  built  a  boat  of  timber  felled \\nin  Nimbrethil  to  journey  in; \\nher  sails  he  wove  of  silver  fair, \\nof  silver  were  her  lanterns  made, \\nher  prow  he  fashioned  like  a  swan, \\nand  light  upon  her  banners  laid. \\n\\nIn  panoply  of  ancient  kings, \\nin  chained  rings  he  armoured  him; \\nhis  shining  shield  was  scored  with  runes \\nto  ward  all  wounds  and  harm  from  him; \\nhis  bow  was  made  of  dragon-horn, \\nhis  arrows  shorn  of  ebony, \\nof  silver  was  his  habergeon, \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\n305 \\n\\n\\nhis  scabbard  of  chalcedony; \\nhis  sword  of  steel  was  valiant, \\nof  adamant  his  helmet  tall, \\nan  eagle-plume  upon  his  crest, \\nupon  his  breast  an  emerald. \\n\\nBeneath  the  Moon  and  under  star \\nhe  wandered  far  from  northern  strands, \\nbewildered  on  enchanted  ways \\nbeyond  the  days  of  mortal  lands. \\n\\nFrom  gnashing  of  the  Narrow  Ice \\nwhere  shadow  lies  on  frozen  hills, \\nfrom  nether  heats  and  burning  waste \\nhe  turned  in  haste,  and  roving  still \\non  starless  waters  far  astray \\nat  last  he  came  to  Night  of  Naught, \\nand  passed,  and  never  sight  he  saw \\nof  shining  shore  nor  light  he  sought. \\n\\nThe  winds  of  wrath  came  driving  him, \\nand  blindly  in  the  foam  he  fled \\nfrom  west  to  east,  and  errandless, \\nunheralded  he  homeward  sped. \\n\\nThere  flying  Elwing  came  to  him, \\nand  flame  was  in  the  darkness  lit; \\nmore  bright  than  light  of  diamond \\nthe  fire  upon  her  carcanet. \\n\\nThe  Silmaril  she  bound  on  him \\nand  crowned  him  with  the  living  light, \\nand  dauntless  then  with  burning  brow \\nhe  turned  his  prow;  and  in  the  night \\nfrom  Otherworld  beyond  the  Sea \\nthere  strong  and  free  a  storm  arose, \\na  wind  of  power  in  Tarmenel; \\nby  paths  that  seldom  mortal  goes \\nhis  boat  it  bore  with  biting  breath \\nas  might  of  death  across  the  grey \\n\\n\\n306 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nand  long-forsaken  seas  distressed: \\nfrom  east  to  west  he  passed  away. \\n\\nThrough  Evernight  he  back  was  borne \\non  black  and  roaring  waves  that  ran \\no’er  leagues  unlit  and  foundered  shores \\nthat  drowned  before  the  Days  began, \\nuntil  he  heard  on  strands  of  pearl \\nwhere  ends  the  world  the  music  long, \\nwhere  ever-foaming  billows  roll \\nthe  yellow  gold  and  jewels  wan. \\n\\nHe  saw  the  Mountain  silent  rise \\nwhere  twilight  lies  upon  the  knees \\nof  Valinor,  and  Eldamar \\nbeheld  afar  beyond  the  seas. \\n\\nA  wanderer  escaped  from  night \\nto  haven  white  he  came  at  last, \\nto  Elvenhome  the  green  and  fair \\nwhere  keen  the  air,  where  pale  as  glass \\nbeneath  the  Hill  of  Ilmarin \\na-glimmer  in  a  valley  sheer \\nthe  lamplit  towers  of  Tirion \\nare  mirrored  on  the  Shadowmere. \\n\\nHe  tarried  there  from  errantry, \\nand  melodies  they  taught  to  him, \\nand  sages  old  him  marvels  told, \\nand  harps  of  gold  they  brought  to  him. \\nThey  clothed  him  then  in  elven-white, \\nand  seven  lights  before  him  sent, \\nas  through  the  Calacirian \\nto  hidden  land  forlorn  he  went. \\n\\nHe  came  unto  the  timeless  halls \\nwhere  shining  fall  the  countless  years, \\nand  endless  reigns  the  Elder  King \\nin  Ilmarin  on  Mountain  sheer; \\nand  words  unheard  were  spoken  then \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\n307 \\n\\n\\nof  folk  of  Men  and  Elven-kin, \\nbeyond  the  world  were  visions  showed \\nforbid  to  those  that  dwell  therein. \\n\\nA  ship  then  new  they  built  for  him \\nof  mithril  and  of  elven-glass \\nwith  shining  prow;  no  shaven  oar \\nnor  sail  she  bore  on  silver  mast: \\nthe  Silmaril  as  lantern  light \\nand  banner  bright  with  living  flame \\nto  gleam  thereon  by  Elbereth \\nherself  was  set,  who  thither  came \\nand  wings  immortal  made  for  him, \\nand  laid  on  him  undying  doom, \\nto  sail  the  shoreless  skies  and  come \\nbehind  the  Sun  and  light  of  Moon. \\n\\nFrom  Evereven’s  lofty  hills \\nwhere  softly  silver  fountains  fall \\nhis  wings  him  bore,  a  wandering  light, \\nbeyond  the  mighty  Mountain  Wall. \\nFrom  World’s  End  then  he  turned  away, \\nand  yearned  again  to  find  afar \\nhis  home  through  shadows  journeying, \\nand  burning  as  an  island  star \\non  high  above  the  mists  he  came, \\na  distant  flame  before  the  Sun, \\na  wonder  ere  the  waking  dawn \\nwhere  grey  the  Norland  waters  run. \\n\\nAnd  over  Middle-earth  he  passed \\nand  heard  at  last  the  weeping  sore \\nof  women  and  of  elven-maids \\nin  Elder  Days,  in  years  of  yore. \\n\\nBut  on  him  mighty  doom  was  laid, \\ntill  Moon  should  fade,  an  orbed  star \\nto  pass,  and  tarry  never  more \\n\\n\\n308 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\non  Hither  Shores  where  mortals  are;

Frodo  opened  his  eyes  and  saw  that \\nBilbo  was  seated  on  his  stool  in  a  circle  of  listeners,  who  were \\nsmiling  and  applauding. \\n\\n‘Now  we  had  better  have  it  again,’  said  an  Elf. \\n\\nBilbo  got  up  and  bowed.  ‘I  am  flattered,  Lindir,’  he  said. \\n‘But  it  would  be  too  tiring  to  repeat  it  all.’ \\n\\n‘Not  too  tiring  for  you,’  the  Elves  answered  laughing.  ‘You \\nknow  you  are  never  tired  of  reciting  your  own  verses.  But \\nreally  we  cannot  answer  your  question  at  one  hearing!’ \\n\\n‘What!’  cried  Bilbo.  ‘You  can’t  tell  which  parts  were  mine, \\nand  which  were  the  Dunadan’s?’ \\n\\n‘It  is  not  easy  for  us  to  tell  the  difference  between  two \\nmortals,’  said  the  Elf. \\n\\n‘Nonsense,  Lindir,’  snorted  Bilbo.  ‘If  you  can’t  distinguish \\nbetween  a  Man  and  a  Hobbit,  your  judgement  is  poorer  than \\nI  imagined.  They’re  as  different  as  peas  and  apples.’ \\n\\n‘Maybe.  To  sheep  other  sheep  no  doubt  appear  different,’ \\nlaughed  Lindir.  ‘Or  to  shepherds.  But  Mortals  have  not  been \\nour  study.  We  have  other  business.’ \\n\\n‘I  won’t  argue  with  you,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘I  am  sleepy  after  so \\nmuch  music  and  singing.  I’ll  leave  you  to  guess,  if  you  want \\nto.’ \\n\\nHe  got  up  and  came  towards  Frodo.  Well,  that’s  over,’  he \\nsaid  in  a  low  voice.  ‘It  went  off  better  than  I  expected.  I  don’t \\noften  get  asked  for  a  second  hearing.  What  did  you  think \\nof  it?’ \\n\\n‘I  am  not  going  to  try  and  guess,’  said  Frodo  smiling. \\n\\n‘You  needn’t,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘As  a  matter  of  fact  it  was  all \\nmine.  Except  that  Aragorn  insisted  on  my  putting  in  a  green \\nstone.  He  seemed  to  think  it  important.  I  don’t  know  why. \\nOtherwise  he  obviously  thought  the  whole  thing  rather  above \\n\\n\\nMANY  MEETINGS \\n\\n\\n309 \\n\\n\\nmy  head,  and  he  said  that  if  I  had  the  cheek  to  make  verses \\nabout  Earendil  in  the  house  of  Elrond,  it  was  my  affair.  I \\nsuppose  he  was  right.’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know,’  said  Frodo.  ‘It  seemed  to  me  to  fit  somehow, \\nthough  I  can’t  explain.  I  was  half  asleep  when  you  began, \\nand  it  seemed  to  follow  on  from  something  that  I  was  dream¬ \\ning  about.  I  didn’t  understand  that  it  was  really  you  speaking \\nuntil  near  the  end.’ \\n\\n‘It  is  difficult  to  keep  awake  here,  until  you  get  used  to  it,’ \\nsaid  Bilbo.  ‘Not  that  hobbits  would  ever  acquire  quite  the \\nElvish  appetite  for  music  and  poetry  and  tales.  They  seem  to \\nlike  them  as  much  as  food,  or  more.  They  will  be  going  on \\nfor  a  long  time  yet.  What  do  you  say  to  slipping  off  for  some \\nmore  quiet  talk?’ \\n\\n‘Can  we?’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Of  course.  This  is  merrymaking  not  business.  Come  and \\ngo  as  you  like,  as  long  as  you  don’t  make  a  noise.’ \\n\\nThey  got  up  and  withdrew  quietly  into  the  shadows,  and \\nmade  for  the  doors.  Sam  they  left  behind,  fast  asleep  still  with \\na  smile  on  his  face.  In  spite  of  his  delight  in  Bilbo’s  company \\nFrodo  felt  a  tug  of  regret  as  they  passed  out  of  the  Hall  of \\nFire.  Even  as  they  stepped  over  the  threshold  a  single  clear \\nvoice  rose  in  song. \\n\\nA  Elbereth  Gilthoniel, \\nsilivren  penna  miriel \\n0  menel  aglar  elenath! \\n\\nNa-chaered  palan-diriel \\n0  galadhremmin  ennorath, \\n\\nFanuilos,  le  linnathon \\nnef  aear,  si  nef  aearon! \\n\\nFrodo  halted  for  a  moment,  looking  back.  Elrond  was  in \\nhis  chair  and  the  fire  was  on  his  face  like  summer-light  upon \\nthe  trees.  Near  him  sat  the  Lady  Arwen.  To  his  surprise \\nFrodo  saw  that  Aragorn  stood  beside  her;  his  dark  cloak  was \\n\\n\\n3io \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nthrown  back,  and  he  seemed  to  be  clad  in  elven-mail,  and  a \\nstar  shone  on  his  breast.  They  spoke  together,  and  then  sud¬ \\ndenly  it  seemed  to  Frodo  that  Arwen  turned  towards  him, \\nand  the  light  of  her  eyes  fell  on  him  from  afar  and  pierced \\nhis  heart. \\n\\nHe  stood  still  enchanted,  while  the  sweet  syllables  of  the \\nElvish  song  fell  like  clear  jewels  of  blended  word  and  melody. \\n‘It  is  a  song  to  Elbereth,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘They  will  sing  that,  and \\nother  songs  of  the  Blessed  Realm,  many  times  tonight.  Come \\non!’ \\n\\nHe  led  Frodo  back  to  his  own  little  room.  It  opened  on  to \\nthe  gardens  and  looked  south  across  the  ravine  of  the \\nBruinen.  There  they  sat  for  some  while,  looking  through  the \\nwindow  at  the  bright  stars  above  the  steep-climbing  woods, \\nand  talking  softly.  They  spoke  no  more  of  the  small  news  of \\nthe  Shire  far  away,  nor  of  the  dark  shadows  and  perils  that \\nencompassed  them,  but  of  the  fair  things  they  had  seen  in \\nthe  world  together,  of  the  Elves,  of  the  stars,  of  trees,  and  the \\ngentle  fall  of  the  bright  year  in  the  woods. \\n\\nAt  last  there  came  a  knock  on  the  door.  ‘Begging  your \\npardon,’  said  Sam,  putting  in  his  head,  ‘but  I  was  just  wonder¬ \\ning  if  you  would  be  wanting  anything.’ \\n\\n‘And  begging  yours,  Sam  Gamgee,’  replied  Bilbo.  ‘I  guess \\nyou  mean  that  it  is  time  your  master  went  to  bed.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  sir,  there  is  a  Council  early  tomorrow,  I  hear,  and \\nhe  only  got  up  today  for  the  first  time.’ \\n\\n‘Quite  right,  Sam,’  laughed  Bilbo.  ‘You  can  trot  off  and \\ntell  Gandalf  that  he  has  gone  to  bed.  Good  night,  Frodo! \\nBless  me,  but  it  has  been  good  to  see  you  again!  There  are \\nno  folk  like  hobbits  after  all  for  a  real  good  talk.  I  am  getting \\nvery  old,  and  I  began  to  wonder  if  I  should  live  to  see  your \\nchapters  of  our  story.  Good  night!  I’ll  take  a  walk,  I  think, \\nand  look  at  the  stars  of  Elbereth  in  the  garden.  Sleep  well!’ \\n\\n\\nChapter  2 \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\nNext  day  Frodo  woke  early,  feeling  refreshed  and  well.  He \\nwalked  along  the  terraces  above  the  loud-flowing  Bruinen \\nand  watched  the  pale,  cool  sun  rise  above  the  far  mountains, \\nand  shine  down,  slanting  through  the  thin  silver  mist;  the \\ndew  upon  the  yellow  leaves  was  glimmering,  and  the  woven \\nnets  of  gossamer  twinkled  on  every  bush.  Sam  walked  beside \\nhim,  saying  nothing,  but  sniffing  the  air,  and  looking  every \\nnow  and  again  with  wonder  in  his  eyes  at  the  great  heights \\nin  the  East.  The  snow  was  white  upon  their  peaks. \\n\\nOn  a  seat  cut  in  the  stone  beside  a  turn  in  the  path  they \\ncame  upon  Gandalf  and  Bilbo  deep  in  talk.  ‘Hullo!  Good \\nmorning!’  said  Bilbo.  ‘Feel  ready  for  the  great  council?’ \\n\\n‘I  feel  ready  for  anything,’  answered  Frodo.  ‘But  most  of \\nall  I  should  like  to  go  walking  today  and  explore  the  valley.  I \\nshould  like  to  get  into  those  pine -woods  up  there.’  He  pointed \\naway  far  up  the  side  of  Rivendell  to  the  north. \\n\\n‘You  may  have  a  chance  later,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘But  we  cannot \\nmake  any  plans  yet.  There  is  much  to  hear  and  decide  today.’ \\n\\nSuddenly  as  they  were  talking  a  single  clear  bell  rang  out. \\n‘That  is  the  warning  bell  for  the  Council  of  Elrond,’  cried \\nGandalf.  ‘Come  along  now!  Both  you  and  Bilbo  are  wanted.’ \\n\\nFrodo  and  Bilbo  followed  the  wizard  quickly  along  the \\nwinding  path  back  to  the  house;  behind  them,  uninvited  and \\nfor  the  moment  forgotten,  trotted  Sam. \\n\\nGandalf  led  them  to  the  porch  where  Frodo  had  found  his \\nfriends  the  evening  before.  The  light  of  the  clear  autumn \\nmorning  was  now  glowing  in  the  valley.  The  noise  of  bub¬ \\nbling  waters  came  up  from  the  foaming  river-bed.  Birds  were \\nsinging,  and  a  wholesome  peace  lay  on  the  land.  To  Frodo \\n\\n\\n312  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nhis  dangerous  flight,  and  the  rumours  of  the  darkness  growing \\nin  the  world  outside,  already  seemed  only  the  memories  of  a \\ntroubled  dream;  but  the  faces  that  were  turned  to  meet  them \\nas  they  entered  were  grave. \\n\\nElrond  was  there,  and  several  others  were  seated  in  silence \\nabout  him.  Frodo  saw  Glorfindel  and  Gloin;  and  in  a  corner \\nalone  Strider  was  sitting,  clad  in  his  old  travel-worn  clothes \\nagain.  Elrond  drew  Frodo  to  a  seat  by  his  side,  and  presented \\nhim  to  the  company,  saying: \\n\\n‘Here,  my  friends,  is  the  hobbit,  Frodo  son  of  Drogo.  Few \\nhave  ever  come  hither  through  greater  peril  or  on  an  errand \\nmore  urgent.’ \\n\\nHe  then  pointed  out  and  named  those  whom  Frodo  had \\nnot  met  before.  There  was  a  younger  dwarf  at  Gloin’s  side: \\nhis  son  Gimli.  Beside  Glorfindel  there  were  several  other \\ncounsellors  of  Elrond’s  household,  of  whom  Erestor  was  the \\nchief;  and  with  him  was  Galdor,  an  Elf  from  the  Grey  Havens \\nwho  had  come  on  an  errand  from  Cirdan  the  Shipwright. \\nThere  was  also  a  strange  Elf  clad  in  green  and  brown, \\nLegolas,  a  messenger  from  his  father,  Thranduil,  the  King  of \\nthe  Elves  of  Northern  Mirkwood.  And  seated  a  little  apart \\nwas  a  tall  man  with  a  fair  and  noble  face,  dark-haired  and \\ngrey-eyed,  proud  and  stern  of  glance. \\n\\nHe  was  cloaked  and  booted  as  if  for  a  journey  on  horse¬ \\nback;  and  indeed  though  his  garments  were  rich,  and  his \\ncloak  was  lined  with  fur,  they  were  stained  with  long  travel. \\nHe  had  a  collar  of  silver  in  which  a  single  white  stone  was \\nset;  his  locks  were  shorn  about  his  shoulders.  On  a  baldric  he \\nwore  a  great  horn  Upped  with  silver  that  now  was  laid  upon \\nhis  knees.  He  gazed  at  Frodo  and  Bilbo  with  sudden  wonder. \\n\\n‘Here,’  said  Elrond,  turning  to  Gandalf,  ‘is  Boromir,  a  man \\nfrom  the  South.  He  arrived  in  the  grey  morning,  and  seeks \\nfor  counsel.  I  have  bidden  him  to  be  present,  for  here  his \\nquestions  will  be  answered.’ \\n\\nNot  all  that  was  spoken  and  debated  in  the  Council  need \\nnow  be  told.  Much  was  said  of  events  in  the  world  outside, \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n313 \\n\\n\\nespecially  in  the  South,  and  in  the  wide  lands  east  of  the \\nMountains.  Of  these  things  Frodo  had  already  heard  many \\nrumours;  but  the  tale  of  Gloin  was  new  to  him,  and  when  the \\ndwarf  spoke  he  listened  attentively.  It  appeared  that  amid  the \\nsplendour  of  their  works  of  hand  the  hearts  of  the  Dwarves \\nof  the  Lonely  Mountain  were  troubled. \\n\\n‘It  is  now  many  years  ago,’  said  Gloin,  ‘that  a  shadow  of \\ndisquiet  fell  upon  our  people.  Whence  it  came  we  did  not  at \\nfirst  perceive.  Words  began  to  be  whispered  in  secret:  it  was \\nsaid  that  we  were  hemmed  in  a  narrow  place,  and  that  greater \\nwealth  and  splendour  would  be  found  in  a  wider  world.  Some \\nspoke  of  Moria:  the  mighty  works  of  our  fathers  that  are \\ncalled  in  our  own  tongue  Khazad-dum;  and  they  declared \\nthat  now  at  last  we  had  the  power  and  numbers  to  return.’ \\n\\nGloin  sighed.  ‘Moria!  Moria!  Wonder  of  the  Northern \\nworld!  Too  deep  we  delved  there,  and  woke  the  nameless \\nfear.  Long  have  its  vast  mansions  lain  empty  since  the  chil¬ \\ndren  of  Durin  fled.  But  now  we  spoke  of  it  again  with  longing, \\nand  yet  with  dread;  for  no  dwarf  has  dared  to  pass  the  doors \\nof  Khazad-dum  for  many  lives  of  kings,  save  Thror  only,  and \\nhe  perished.  At  last,  however,  Balin  listened  to  the  whispers, \\nand  resolved  to  go;  and  though  Dain  did  not  give  leave  will¬ \\ningly,  he  took  with  him  Ori  and  Oin  and  many  of  our  folk, \\nand  they  went  away  south. \\n\\n‘That  was  nigh  on  thirty  years  ago.  For  a  while  we  had \\nnews  and  it  seemed  good:  messages  reported  that  Moria  had \\nbeen  entered  and  a  great  work  begun  there.  Then  there  was \\nsilence,  and  no  word  has  ever  come  from  Moria  since. \\n\\n‘Then  about  a  year  ago  a  messenger  came  to  Dain,  but  not \\nfrom  Moria  -  from  Mordor:  a  horseman  in  the  night,  who \\ncalled  Dain  to  his  gate.  The  Lord  Sauron  the  Great,  so  he \\nsaid,  wished  for  our  friendship.  Rings  he  would  give  for  it, \\nsuch  as  he  gave  of  old.  And  he  asked  urgently  concerning \\nhobbits ,  of  what  land  they  were,  and  where  they  dwelt.  “For \\nSauron  knows,”  said  he,  “that  one  of  these  was  known  to \\nyou  on  a  time.” \\n\\n‘At  this  we  were  greatly  troubled,  and  we  gave  no  answer. \\n\\n\\n314 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nAnd  then  his  fell  voice  was  lowered,  and  he  would  have \\nsweetened  it  if  he  could.  “As  a  small  token  only  of  your \\nfriendship  Sauron  asks  this,”  he  said:  “that  you  should  find \\nthis  thief,”  such  was  his  word,  “and  get  from  him,  willing  or \\nno,  a  little  ring,  the  least  of  rings,  that  once  he  stole.  It  is  but \\na  trifle  that  Sauron  fancies,  and  an  earnest  of  your  good  will. \\nFind  it,  and  three  rings  that  the  Dwarf-sires  possessed  of  old \\nshall  be  returned  to  you,  and  the  realm  of  Moria  shall  be \\nyours  for  ever.  Find  only  news  of  the  thief,  whether  he  still \\nlives  and  where,  and  you  shall  have  great  reward  and  lasting \\nfriendship  from  the  Lord.  Refuse,  and  things  will  not  seem \\nso  well.  Do  you  refuse?” \\n\\n‘At  that  his  breath  came  like  the  hiss  of  snakes,  and  all  who \\nstood  by  shuddered,  but  Dain  said:  “I  say  neither  yea  nor \\nnay.  I  must  consider  this  message  and  what  it  means  under \\nits  fair  cloak.” \\n\\n‘  “Consider  well,  but  not  too  long,”  said  he. \\n\\n‘  “The  time  of  my  thought  is  my  own  to  spend,”  answered \\nDain. \\n\\n‘  “For  the  present,”  said  he,  and  rode  into  the  darkness. \\n\\n‘Heavy  have  the  hearts  of  our  chieftains  been  since  that \\nnight.  We  needed  not  the  fell  voice  of  the  messenger  to  warn \\nus  that  his  words  held  both  menace  and  deceit;  for  we  knew \\nalready  that  the  power  that  has  re-entered  Mordor  has  not \\nchanged,  and  ever  it  betrayed  us  of  old.  Twice  the  messenger \\nhas  returned,  and  has  gone  unanswered.  The  third  and  last \\ntime,  so  he  says,  is  soon  to  come,  before  the  ending  of  the \\nyear. \\n\\n‘And  so  I  have  been  sent  at  last  by  Dain  to  warn  Bilbo  that \\nhe  is  sought  by  the  Enemy,  and  to  learn,  if  may  be,  why  he \\ndesires  this  ring,  this  least  of  rings.  Also  we  crave  the  advice \\nof  Elrond.  For  the  Shadow  grows  and  draws  nearer.  We \\ndiscover  that  messengers  have  come  also  to  King  Brand  in \\nDale,  and  that  he  is  afraid.  We  fear  that  he  may  yield.  Already \\nwar  is  gathering  on  his  eastern  borders.  If  we  make  no  answer, \\nthe  Enemy  may  move  Men  of  his  rule  to  assail  King  Brand, \\nand  Dain  also.’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n315 \\n\\n\\n‘You  have  done  well  to  come,’  said  Elrond.  ‘You  will  hear \\ntoday  all  that  you  need  in  order  to  understand  the  purposes \\nof  the  Enemy.  There  is  naught  that  you  can  do,  other  than \\nto  resist,  with  hope  or  without  it.  But  you  do  not  stand  alone. \\nYou  will  learn  that  your  trouble  is  but  part  of  the  trouble  of \\nall  the  western  world.  The  Ring!  What  shall  we  do  with  the \\nRing,  the  least  of  rings,  the  trifle  that  Sauron  fancies?  That \\nis  the  doom  that  we  must  deem. \\n\\n‘That  is  the  purpose  for  which  you  are  called  hither.  Called, \\nI  say,  though  I  have  not  called  you  to  me,  strangers  from \\ndistant  lands.  You  have  come  and  are  here  met,  in  this  very \\nnick  of  time,  by  chance  as  it  may  seem.  Yet  it  is  not  so. \\nBelieve  rather  that  it  is  so  ordered  that  we,  who  sit  here, \\nand  none  others,  must  now  find  counsel  for  the  peril  of  the \\nworld. \\n\\n‘Now,  therefore,  things  shall  be  openly  spoken  that  have \\nbeen  hidden  from  all  but  a  few  until  this  day.  And  first,  so \\nthat  all  may  understand  what  is  the  peril,  the  Tale  of  the  Ring \\nshall  be  told  from  the  beginning  even  to  this  present.  And  I \\nwill  begin  that  tale,  though  others  shall  end  it.’ \\n\\nThen  all  listened  while  Elrond  in  his  clear  voice  spoke  of \\nSauron  and  the  Rings  of  Power,  and  their  forging  in  the \\nSecond  Age  of  the  world  long  ago.  A  part  of  his  tale  was \\nknown  to  some  there,  but  the  full  tale  to  none,  and  many \\neyes  were  turned  to  Elrond  in  fear  and  wonder  as  he  told  of \\nthe  Elven-smiths  of  Eregion  and  their  friendship  with  Moria, \\nand  their  eagerness  for  knowledge,  by  which  Sauron  ensnared \\nthem.  For  in  that  time  he  was  not  yet  evil  to  behold,  and  they \\nreceived  his  aid  and  grew  mighty  in  craft,  whereas  he  learned \\nall  their  secrets,  and  betrayed  them,  and  forged  secretly  in \\nthe  Mountain  of  Fire  the  One  Ring  to  be  their  master.  But \\nCelebrimbor  was  aware  of  him,  and  hid  the  Three  which  he \\nhad  made;  and  there  was  war,  and  the  land  was  laid  waste, \\nand  the  gate  of  Moria  was  shut. \\n\\nThen  through  all  the  years  that  followed  he  traced  the \\nRing;  but  since  that  history  is  elsewhere  recounted,  even  as \\n\\n\\n3i6 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nElrond  himself  set  it  down  in  his  books  of  lore,  it  is  not  here \\nrecalled.  For  it  is  a  long  tale,  full  of  deeds  great  and  terrible, \\nand  briefly  though  Elrond  spoke,  the  sun  rode  up  the  sky, \\nand  the  morning  was  passing  ere  he  ceased. \\n\\nOf  Numenor  he  spoke,  its  glory  and  its  fall,  and  the  return \\nof  the  Kings  of  Men  to  Middle-earth  out  of  the  deeps  of  the \\nSea,  borne  upon  the  wings  of  storm.  Then  Elendil  the  Tall \\nand  his  mighty  sons,  Isildur  and  Anarion,  became  great  lords; \\nand  the  North-realm  they  made  in  Arnor,  and  the  South- \\nrealm  in  Gondor  above  the  mouths  of  Anduin.  But  Sauron \\nof  Mordor  assailed  them,  and  they  made  the  Last  Alliance  of \\nElves  and  Men,  and  the  hosts  of  Gil-galad  and  Elendil  were \\nmustered  in  Arnor. \\n\\nThereupon  Elrond  paused  a  while  and  sighed.  ‘I  remember \\nwell  the  splendour  of  their  banners,’  he  said.  ‘It  recalled  to \\nme  the  glory  of  the  Elder  Days  and  the  hosts  of  Beleriand, \\nso  many  great  princes  and  captains  were  assembled.  And  yet \\nnot  so  many,  nor  so  fair,  as  when  Thangorodrim  was  broken, \\nand  the  Elves  deemed  that  evil  was  ended  for  ever,  and  it  was \\nnot  so.’ \\n\\n‘You  remember?’  said  Frodo,  speaking  his  thought  aloud \\nin  his  astonishment.  ‘But  I  thought,’  he  stammered  as  Elrond \\nturned  towards  him,  ‘I  thought  that  the  fall  of  Gil-galad  was \\na  long  age  ago.’ \\n\\n‘So  it  was  indeed,’  answered  Elrond  gravely.  ‘But  my \\nmemory  reaches  back  even  to  the  Elder  Days.  Earendil  was \\nmy  sire,  who  was  born  in  Gondolin  before  its  fall;  and  my \\nmother  was  Elwing,  daughter  of  Dior,  son  of  Luthien  of \\nDoriath.  I  have  seen  three  ages  in  the  West  of  the  world,  and \\nmany  defeats,  and  many  fruitless  victories. \\n\\n‘I  was  the  herald  of  Gil-galad  and  marched  with  his  host. \\nI  was  at  the  Battle  of  Dagorlad  before  the  Black  Gate  of \\nMordor,  where  we  had  the  mastery:  for  the  Spear  of  Gil-galad \\nand  the  Sword  of  Elendil,  Aeglos  and  Narsil,  none  could \\nwithstand.  I  beheld  the  last  combat  on  the  slopes  of  Orodruin, \\nwhere  Gil-galad  died,  and  Elendil  fell,  and  Narsil  broke \\nbeneath  him;  but  Sauron  himself  was  overthrown,  and  Isildur \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND  317 \\n\\ncut  the  Ring  from  his  hand  with  the  hilt-shard  of  his  father’s \\nsword,  and  took  it  for  his  own.’ \\n\\nAt  this  the  stranger,  Boromir,  broke  in.  ‘So  that  is  what \\nbecame  of  the  Ring!’  he  cried.  ‘If  ever  such  a  tale  was  told  in \\nthe  South,  it  has  long  been  forgotten.  I  have  heard  of  the \\nGreat  Ring  of  him  that  we  do  not  name;  but  we  believed  that \\nit  perished  from  the  world  in  the  ruin  of  his  first  realm.  Isildur \\ntook  it!  That  is  tidings  indeed.’ \\n\\n‘Alas!  yes,’  said  Elrond.  ‘Isildur  took  it,  as  should  not  have \\nbeen.  It  should  have  been  cast  then  into  Orodruin’s  fire  nigh \\nat  hand  where  it  was  made.  But  few  marked  what  Isildur  did. \\nHe  alone  stood  by  his  father  in  that  last  mortal  contest;  and \\nby  Gil-galad  only  Cirdan  stood,  and  I.  But  Isildur  would  not \\nlisten  to  our  counsel. \\n\\n‘  “This  I  will  have  as  weregild  for  my  father,  and  my \\nbrother,”  he  said;  and  therefore  whether  we  would  or  no,  he \\ntook  it  to  treasure  it.  But  soon  he  was  betrayed  by  it  to  his \\ndeath;  and  so  it  is  named  in  the  North  Isildur’s  Bane.  Yet \\ndeath  maybe  was  better  than  what  else  might  have  befallen \\nhim. \\n\\n‘Only  to  the  North  did  these  tidings  come,  and  only  to  a \\nfew.  Small  wonder  is  it  that  you  have  not  heard  them, \\nBoromir.  From  the  ruin  of  the  Gladden  Fields,  where  Isildur \\nperished,  three  men  only  came  ever  back  over  the  mountains \\nafter  long  wandering.  One  of  these  was  Ohtar,  the  esquire  of \\nIsildur,  who  bore  the  shards  of  the  sword  of  Elendil;  and  he \\nbrought  them  to  Valandil,  the  heir  of  Isildur,  who  being  but \\na  child  had  remained  here  in  Rivendell.  But  Narsil  was  broken \\nand  its  light  extinguished,  and  it  has  not  yet  been  forged \\nagain. \\n\\n‘Fruitless  did  I  call  the  victory  of  the  Last  Alliance?  Not \\nwholly  so,  yet  it  did  not  achieve  its  end.  Sauron  was  dimin¬ \\nished,  but  not  destroyed.  His  Ring  was  lost  but  not  unmade. \\nThe  Dark  Tower  was  broken,  but  its  foundations  were  not \\nremoved;  for  they  were  made  with  the  power  of  the  Ring, \\nand  while  it  remains  they  will  endure.  Many  Elves  and  many \\nmighty  Men,  and  many  of  their  friends,  had  perished  in  the \\n\\n\\n318  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nwar.  Anarion  was  slain,  and  Isildur  was  slain;  and  Gil-galad \\nand  Elendil  were  no  more.  Never  again  shall  there  be  any \\nsuch  league  of  Elves  and  Men;  for  Men  multiply  and  the \\nFirstborn  decrease,  and  the  two  kindreds  are  estranged.  And \\never  since  that  day  the  race  of  Numenor  has  decayed,  and \\nthe  span  of  their  years  has  lessened. \\n\\n‘In  the  North  after  the  war  and  the  slaughter  of  the  Gladden \\nFields  the  Men  of  Westernesse  were  diminished,  and  their \\ncity  of  Annuminas  beside  Lake  Evendim  fell  into  ruin;  and \\nthe  heirs  of  Valandil  removed  and  dwelt  at  Fornost  on  the \\nhigh  North  Downs,  and  that  now  too  is  desolate.  Men  call  it \\nDeadmen’s  Dike,  and  they  fear  to  tread  there.  For  the  folk \\nof  Arnor  dwindled,  and  their  foes  devoured  them,  and  their \\nlordship  passed,  leaving  only  green  mounds  in  the  grassy \\nhills. \\n\\n‘In  the  South  the  realm  of  Gondor  long  endured;  and  for \\na  while  its  splendour  grew,  recalling  somewhat  of  the  might \\nof  Numenor,  ere  it  fell.  High  towers  that  people  built,  and \\nstrong  places,  and  havens  of  many  ships;  and  the  winged \\ncrown  of  the  Kings  of  Men  was  held  in  awe  by  folk  of  many \\ntongues.  Their  chief  city  was  Osgiliath,  Citadel  of  the  Stars, \\nthrough  the  midst  of  which  the  River  flowed.  And  Minas \\nIthil  they  built,  Tower  of  the  Rising  Moon,  eastward  upon  a \\nshoulder  of  the  Mountains  of  Shadow;  and  westward  at  the \\nfeet  of  the  White  Mountains  Minas  Anor  they  made,  Tower \\nof  the  Setting  Sun.  There  in  the  courts  of  the  King  grew  a \\nwhite  tree,  from  the  seed  of  that  tree  which  Isildur  brought \\nover  the  deep  waters,  and  the  seed  of  that  tree  before  came \\nfrom  Eressea,  and  before  that  out  of  the  Uttermost  West  in \\nthe  Day  before  days  when  the  world  was  young. \\n\\n‘But  in  the  wearing  of  the  swift  years  of  Middle-earth  the \\nline  of  Meneldil  son  of  Anarion  failed,  and  the  Tree  withered, \\nand  the  blood  of  the  Numenoreans  became  mingled  with  that \\nof  lesser  men.  Then  the  watch  upon  the  walls  of  Mordor \\nslept,  and  dark  things  crept  back  to  Gorgoroth.  And  on  a \\ntime  evil  things  came  forth,  and  they  took  Minas  Ithil  and \\nabode  in  it,  and  they  made  it  into  a  place  of  dread;  and  it  is \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n319 \\n\\n\\ncalled  Minas  Morgul,  the  Tower  of  Sorcery.  Then  Minas \\nAnor  was  named  anew  Minas  Tirith,  the  Tower  of  Guard; \\nand  these  two  cities  were  ever  at  war,  but  Osgiliath  which  lay \\nbetween  was  deserted  and  in  its  ruins  shadows  walked. \\n\\n‘So  it  has  been  for  many  lives  of  men.  But  the  Lords  of \\nMinas  Tirith  still  fight  on,  defying  our  enemies,  keeping  the \\npassage  of  the  River  from  Argonath  to  the  Sea.  And  now  that \\npart  of  the  tale  that  I  shall  tell  is  drawn  to  its  close.  For  in  the \\ndays  of  Isildur  the  Ruling  Ring  passed  out  of  all  knowledge, \\nand  the  Three  were  released  from  its  dominion.  But  now  in \\nthis  latter  day  they  are  in  peril  once  more,  for  to  our  sorrow \\nthe  One  has  been  found.  Others  shall  speak  of  its  finding,  for \\nin  that  I  played  small  part.’ \\n\\nHe  ceased,  but  at  once  Boromir  stood  up,  tall  and  proud, \\nbefore  them.  ‘Give  me  leave,  Master  Elrond,’  said  he,  ‘first \\nto  say  more  of  Gondor,  for  verily  from  the  land  of  Gondor  I \\nam  come.  And  it  would  be  well  for  all  to  know  what  passes \\nthere.  For  few,  I  deem,  know  of  our  deeds,  and  therefore \\nguess  little  at  their  peril,  if  we  should  fail  at  last. \\n\\n‘Believe  not  that  in  the  land  of  Gondor  the  blood  of \\nNumenor  is  spent,  nor  all  its  pride  and  dignity  forgotten.  By \\nour  valour  the  wild  folk  of  the  East  are  still  restrained,  and \\nthe  terror  of  Morgul  kept  at  bay;  and  thus  alone  are  peace \\nand  freedom  maintained  in  the  lands  behind  us,  bulwark  of \\nthe  West.  But  if  the  passages  of  the  River  should  be  won, \\nwhat  then? \\n\\n‘Yet  that  hour,  maybe,  is  not  now  far  away.  The  Name¬ \\nless  Enemy  has  arisen  again.  Smoke  rises  once  more  from \\nOrodruin  that  we  call  Mount  Doom.  The  power  of  the  Black \\nLand  grows  and  we  are  hard  beset.  When  the  Enemy  re¬ \\nturned  our  folk  were  driven  from  Ithilien,  our  fair  domain  east \\nof  the  River,  though  we  kept  a  foothold  there  and  strength  of \\narms.  But  this  very  year,  in  the  days  of  June,  sudden  war \\ncame  upon  us  out  of  Mordor,  and  we  were  swept  away. \\nWe  were  outnumbered,  for  Mordor  has  allied  itself  with  the \\nEasterlings  and  the  cruel  Haradrim;  but  it  was  not  by \\n\\n\\n320 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nnumbers  that  we  were  defeated.  A  power  was  there  that  we \\nhave  not  felt  before. \\n\\n‘Some  said  that  it  could  be  seen,  like  a  great  black  horse¬ \\nman,  a  dark  shadow  under  the  moon.  Wherever  he  came  a \\nmadness  filled  our  foes,  but  fear  fell  on  our  boldest,  so  that \\nhorse  and  man  gave  way  and  fled.  Only  a  remnant  of  our \\neastern  force  came  back,  destroying  the  last  bridge  that  still \\nstood  amid  the  ruins  of  Osgiliath. \\n\\n‘I  was  in  the  company  that  held  the  bridge,  until  it  was  cast \\ndown  behind  us.  Four  only  were  saved  by  swimming:  my \\nbrother  and  myself  and  two  others.  But  still  we  fight  on, \\nholding  all  the  west  shores  of  Anduin;  and  those  who  shelter \\nbehind  us  give  us  praise,  if  ever  they  hear  our  name:  much \\npraise  but  little  help.  Only  from  Rohan  now  will  any  men \\nride  to  us  when  we  call. \\n\\n‘In  this  evil  hour  I  have  come  on  an  errand  over  many \\ndangerous  leagues  to  Elrond:  a  hundred  and  ten  days  I  have \\njourneyed  all  alone.  But  I  do  not  seek  allies  in  war.  The  might \\nof  Elrond  is  in  wisdom  not  in  weapons,  it  is  said.  I  come  to \\nask  for  counsel  and  the  unravelling  of  hard  words.  For  on  the \\neve  of  the  sudden  assault  a  dream  came  to  my  brother  in  a \\ntroubled  sleep;  and  afterwards  a  like  dream  came  oft  to  him \\nagain,  and  once  to  me. \\n\\n‘In  that  dream  I  thought  the  eastern  sky  grew  dark  and \\nthere  was  a  growing  thunder,  but  in  the  West  a  pale  light \\nlingered,  and  out  of  it  I  heard  a  voice,  remote  but  clear, \\ncrying: \\n\\n\\nSeek  for  the  Sword  that  was  broken: \\n\\nIn  Imladris  it  dwells; \\n\\nThere  shall  be  counsels  taken \\nStronger  than  Morgul-spells. \\n\\nThere  shall  be  shown  a  token \\nThat  Doom  is  near  at  hand, \\n\\nFor  Isildur’s  Bane  shall  waken, \\n\\nAnd  the  Halfling  forth  shall  stand. \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n321 \\n\\n\\nOf  these  words  we  could  understand  little,  and  we  spoke  to \\nour  father,  Denethor,  Lord  of  Minas  Tirith,  wise  in  the  lore \\nof  Gondor.  This  only  would  he  say,  that  Imladris  was  of  old \\nthe  name  among  the  Elves  of  a  far  northern  dale,  where \\nElrond  the  Halfelven  dwelt,  greatest  of  lore -masters.  There¬ \\nfore  my  brother,  seeing  how  desperate  was  our  need,  was \\neager  to  heed  the  dream  and  seek  for  Imladris;  but  since  the \\nway  was  full  of  doubt  and  danger,  I  took  the  journey  upon \\nmyself.  Loth  was  my  father  to  give  me  leave,  and  long  have \\nI  wandered  by  roads  forgotten,  seeking  the  house  of  Elrond, \\nof  which  many  had  heard,  but  few  knew  where  it  lay.’ \\n\\n‘And  here  in  the  house  of  Elrond  more  shall  be  made  clear \\nto  you,’  said  Aragorn,  standing  up.  He  cast  his  sword  upon \\nthe  table  that  stood  before  Elrond,  and  the  blade  was  in  two \\npieces.  ‘Here  is  the  Sword  that  was  Broken!’  he  said. \\n\\n‘And  who  are  you,  and  what  have  you  to  do  with  Minas \\nTirith?’  asked  Boromir,  looking  in  wonder  at  the  lean  face  of \\nthe  Ranger  and  his  weather-stained  cloak. \\n\\n‘He  is  Aragorn  son  of  Arathorn,’  said  Elrond;  ‘and  he  is \\ndescended  through  many  fathers  from  Isildur  Elendil’s  son \\nof  Minas  Ithil.  He  is  the  Chief  of  the  Dunedain  in  the  North, \\nand  few  are  now  left  of  that  folk.’ \\n\\n‘Then  it  belongs  to  you,  and  not  to  me  at  all!’  cried  Frodo \\nin  amazement,  springing  to  his  feet,  as  if  he  expected  the \\nRing  to  be  demanded  at  once. \\n\\n‘It  does  not  belong  to  either  of  us,’  said  Aragorn;  ‘but  it \\nhas  been  ordained  that  you  should  hold  it  for  a  while.’ \\n\\n‘Bring  out  the  Ring,  Frodo!’  said  Gandalf  solemnly.  ‘The \\ntime  has  come.  Hold  it  up,  and  then  Boromir  will  understand \\nthe  remainder  of  his  riddle.’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  hush,  and  all  turned  their  eyes  on  Frodo.  He \\nwas  shaken  by  a  sudden  shame  and  fear;  and  he  felt  a  great \\nreluctance  to  reveal  the  Ring,  and  a  loathing  of  its  touch.  He \\nwished  he  was  far  away.  The  Ring  gleamed  and  flickered  as \\nhe  held  it  up  before  them  in  his  trembling  hand. \\n\\n\\n322 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Behold  Isildur’s  Bane!’  said  Elrond. \\n\\nBoromir’s  eyes  glinted  as  he  gazed  at  the  golden  thing. \\n‘The  Halfling!’  he  muttered.  ‘Is  then  the  doom  of  Minas  Tirith \\ncome  at  last?  But  why  then  should  we  seek  a  broken  sword?’ \\n\\n‘The  words  were  not  the  doom  of  Minas  Tirith ,’  said \\nAragorn.  ‘But  doom  and  great  deeds  are  indeed  at  hand.  For \\nthe  Sword  that  was  Broken  is  the  Sword  of  Elendil  that  broke \\nbeneath  him  when  he  fell.  It  has  been  treasured  by  his  heirs \\nwhen  all  other  heirlooms  were  lost;  for  it  was  spoken  of  old \\namong  us  that  it  should  be  made  again  when  the  Ring, \\nIsildur’s  Bane,  was  found.  Now  you  have  seen  the  sword  that \\nyou  have  sought,  what  would  you  ask?  Do  you  wish  for  the \\nHouse  of  Elendil  to  return  to  the  Land  of  Gondor?’ \\n\\n‘I  was  not  sent  to  beg  any  boon,  but  to  seek  only  the \\nmeaning  of  a  riddle,’  answered  Boromir  proudly.  ‘Yet  we  are \\nhard  pressed,  and  the  Sword  of  Elendil  would  be  a  help \\nbeyond  our  hope  -  if  such  a  thing  could  indeed  return  out  of \\nthe  shadows  of  the  past.’  He  looked  again  at  Aragorn,  and \\ndoubt  was  in  his  eyes. \\n\\nFrodo  felt  Bilbo  stir  impatiently  at  his  side.  Evidently  he \\nwas  annoyed  on  his  friend’s  behalf.  Standing  suddenly  up  he \\nburst  out: \\n\\nAll  that  is  gold  does  not  glitter, \\n\\nNot  all  those  who  wander  are  lost; \\n\\nThe  old  that  is  strong  does  not  wither, \\n\\nDeep  roots  are  not  reached  by  the  frost. \\n\\nFrom  the  ashes  afire  shall  be  woken, \\n\\nA  light  from  the  shadows  shall  spring; \\n\\nRenewed  shall  be  blade  that  was  broken: \\n\\nThe  crownless  again  shall  be  king. \\n\\n‘Not  very  good  perhaps,  but  to  the  point  -  if  you  need  more \\nbeyond  the  word  of  Elrond.  If  that  was  worth  a  journey  of  a \\nhundred  and  ten  days  to  hear,  you  had  best  listen  to  it.’  He \\nsat  down  with  a  snort. \\n\\n‘I  made  that  up  myself,’  he  whispered  to  Frodo,  ‘for  the \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n323 \\n\\n\\nDunadan,  a  long  time  ago  when  he  first  told  me  about  him¬ \\nself.  I  almost  wish  that  my  adventures  were  not  over,  and \\nthat  I  could  go  with  him  when  his  day  comes.’ \\n\\nAragorn  smiled  at  him;  then  he  turned  to  Boromir  again. \\n‘For  my  part  I  forgive  your  doubt,’  he  said.  ‘Little  do  I \\nresemble  the  figures  of  Elendil  and  Isildur  as  they  stand \\ncarven  in  their  majesty  in  the  halls  of  Denethor.  I  am  but  the \\nheir  of  Isildur,  not  Isildur  himself.  I  have  had  a  hard  life  and \\na  long;  and  the  leagues  that  lie  between  here  and  Gondor  are \\na  small  part  in  the  count  of  my  journeys.  I  have  crossed  many \\nmountains  and  many  rivers,  and  trodden  many  plains,  even \\ninto  the  far  countries  of  Rhun  and  Flarad  where  the  stars  are \\nstrange. \\n\\n‘But  my  home,  such  as  I  have,  is  in  the  North.  For  here \\nthe  heirs  of  Valandil  have  ever  dwelt  in  long  line  unbroken \\nfrom  father  unto  son  for  many  generations.  Our  days  have \\ndarkened,  and  we  have  dwindled;  but  ever  the  Sword  has \\npassed  to  a  new  keeper.  And  this  I  will  say  to  you,  Boromir, \\nere  I  end.  Lonely  men  are  we,  Rangers  of  the  wild,  hunters \\n-  but  hunters  ever  of  the  servants  of  the  Enemy;  for  they  are \\nfound  in  many  places,  not  in  Mordor  only. \\n\\n‘If  Gondor,  Boromir,  has  been  a  stalwart  tower,  we  have \\nplayed  another  part.  Many  evil  things  there  are  that  your \\nstrong  walls  and  bright  swords  do  not  stay.  You  know  little \\nof  the  lands  beyond  your  bounds.  Peace  and  freedom,  do \\nyou  say?  The  North  would  have  known  them  little  but  for \\nus.  Fear  would  have  destroyed  them.  But  when  dark  things \\ncome  from  the  houseless  hills,  or  creep  from  sunless  woods, \\nthey  fly  from  us.  What  roads  would  any  dare  to  tread,  what \\nsafety  would  there  be  in  quiet  lands,  or  in  the  homes  of  simple \\nmen  at  night,  if  the  Dunedain  were  asleep,  or  were  all  gone \\ninto  the  grave? \\n\\n‘And  yet  less  thanks  have  we  than  you.  Travellers  scowl  at \\nus,  and  countrymen  give  us  scornful  names.  “Strider”  I  am \\nto  one  fat  man  who  lives  within  a  day’s  march  of  foes  that \\nwould  freeze  his  heart,  or  lay  his  little  town  in  ruin,  if  he  were \\nnot  guarded  ceaselessly.  Yet  we  would  not  have  it  otherwise. \\n\\n\\n324  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nIf  simple  folk  are  free  from  care  and  fear,  simple  they  will  be, \\nand  we  must  be  secret  to  keep  them  so.  That  has  been  the \\ntask  of  my  kindred,  while  the  years  have  lengthened  and  the \\ngrass  has  grown. \\n\\n‘But  now  the  world  is  changing  once  again.  A  new  hour \\ncomes.  Isildur’s  Bane  is  found.  Battle  is  at  hand.  The  Sword \\nshall  be  reforged.  I  will  come  to  Minas  Tirith.’ \\n\\n‘Isildur’s  Bane  is  found,  you  say,’  said  Boromir.  ‘I  have \\nseen  a  bright  ring  in  the  Halfling’s  hand;  but  Isildur  perished \\nere  this  age  of  the  world  began,  they  say.  How  do  the  Wise \\nknow  that  this  ring  is  his?  And  how  has  it  passed  down  the \\nyears,  until  it  is  brought  hither  by  so  strange  a  messenger?’ \\n\\n‘That  shall  be  told,’  said  Elrond. \\n\\n‘But  not  yet,  I  beg,  Master!’  cried  Bilbo.  ‘Already  the  Sun \\nis  climbing  to  noon,  and  I  feel  the  need  of  something  to \\nstrengthen  me.’ \\n\\n‘I  had  not  named  you,’  said  Elrond  smiling.  ‘But  I  do  so \\nnow.  Come!  Tell  us  your  tale.  And  if  you  have  not  yet  cast \\nyour  story  into  verse,  you  may  tell  it  in  plain  words.  The \\nbriefer,  the  sooner  shall  you  be  refreshed.’ \\n\\n‘Very  well,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘I  will  do  as  you  bid.  But  I  will  now \\ntell  the  true  story,  and  if  some  here  have  heard  me  tell  it \\notherwise’  -  he  looked  sidelong  at  Gloin  -  ‘I  ask  them  to \\nforget  it  and  forgive  me.  I  only  wished  to  claim  the  treasure \\nas  my  very  own  in  those  days,  and  to  be  rid  of  the  name  of \\nthief  that  was  put  on  me.  But  perhaps  I  understand  things  a \\nlittle  better  now.  Anyway,  this  is  what  happened.’ \\n\\nTo  some  there  Bilbo’s  tale  was  wholly  new,  and  they \\nlistened  with  amazement  while  the  old  hobbit,  actually  not  at \\nall  displeased,  recounted  his  adventure  with  Gollum,  at  full \\nlength.  He  did  not  omit  a  single  riddle.  He  would  have  given \\nalso  an  account  of  his  party  and  disappearance  from  the \\nShire,  if  he  had  been  allowed;  but  Elrond  raised  his  hand. \\n\\n‘Well  told,  my  friend,’  he  said,  ‘but  that  is  enough  at  this \\ntime.  For  the  moment  it  suffices  to  know  that  the  Ring  passed \\nto  Frodo,  your  heir.  Let  him  now  speak!’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n325 \\n\\n\\nThen,  less  willingly  than  Bilbo,  Frodo  told  of  all  his  deal¬ \\nings  with  the  Ring  from  the  day  that  it  passed  into  his  keeping. \\nEvery  step  of  his  journey  from  Hobbiton  to  the  Ford  of \\nBruinen  was  questioned  and  considered,  and  everything  that \\nhe  could  recall  concerning  the  Black  Riders  was  examined. \\nAt  last  he  sat  down  again. \\n\\n‘Not  bad,’  Bilbo  said  to  him.  ‘You  would  have  made  a \\ngood  story  of  it,  if  they  hadn’t  kept  on  interrupting.  I  tried  to \\nmake  a  few  notes,  but  we  shall  have  to  go  over  it  all  again \\ntogether  some  time,  if  I  am  to  write  it  up.  There  are  whole \\nchapters  of  stuff  before  you  ever  got  here!’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  it  made  quite  a  long  tale,’  answered  Frodo.  ‘But  the \\nstory  still  does  not  seem  complete  to  me.  I  still  want  to  know \\na  good  deal,  especially  about  Gandalf.’ \\n\\nGaldor  of  the  Havens,  who  sat  nearby,  overheard  him. \\n‘You  speak  for  me  also,’  he  cried,  and  turning  to  Elrond  he \\nsaid:  ‘The  Wise  may  have  good  reason  to  believe  that  the \\nhalfling’s  trove  is  indeed  the  Great  Ring  of  long  debate, \\nunlikely  though  that  may  seem  to  those  who  know  less.  But \\nmay  we  not  hear  the  proofs?  And  I  would  ask  this  also.  What \\nof  Saruman?  He  is  learned  in  the  lore  of  the  Rings,  yet  he  is \\nnot  among  us.  What  is  his  counsel  -  if  he  knows  the  things \\nthat  we  have  heard?’ \\n\\n‘The  questions  that  you  ask,  Galdor,  are  bound  together,’ \\nsaid  Elrond.  ‘I  had  not  overlooked  them,  and  they  shall  be \\nanswered.  But  these  things  it  is  the  part  of  Gandalf  to  make \\nclear;  and  I  call  upon  him  last,  for  it  is  the  place  of  honour, \\nand  in  all  this  matter  he  has  been  the  chief.’ \\n\\n‘Some,  Galdor,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘would  think  the  tidings  of \\nGloin,  and  the  pursuit  of  Frodo,  proof  enough  that  the \\nhalfling’s  trove  is  a  thing  of  great  worth  to  the  Enemy.  Yet  it \\nis  a  ring.  What  then?  The  Nine  the  Nazgul  keep.  The  Seven \\nare  taken  or  destroyed.’  At  this  Gloin  stirred,  but  did  not \\nspeak.  ‘The  Three  we  know  of.  What  then  is  this  one  that  he \\ndesires  so  much? \\n\\n‘There  is  indeed  a  wide  waste  of  time  between  the  River \\n\\n\\n326 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nand  the  Mountain,  between  the  loss  and  the  finding.  But  the \\ngap  in  the  knowledge  of  the  Wise  has  been  filled  at  last.  Yet \\ntoo  slowly.  For  the  Enemy  has  been  close  behind,  closer  even \\nthan  I  feared.  And  well  is  it  that  not  until  this  year,  this  very \\nsummer,  as  it  seems,  did  he  learn  the  full  truth. \\n\\n‘Some  here  will  remember  that  many  years  ago  I  myself \\ndared  to  pass  the  doors  of  the  Necromancer  in  Dol  Guldur, \\nand  secretly  explored  his  ways,  and  found  thus  that  our  fears \\nwere  true:  he  was  none  other  than  Sauron,  our  Enemy  of \\nold,  at  length  taking  shape  and  power  again.  Some,  too,  will \\nremember  also  that  Saruman  dissuaded  us  from  open  deeds \\nagainst  him,  and  for  long  we  watched  him  only.  Yet  at  last, \\nas  his  shadow  grew,  Saruman  yielded,  and  the  Council  put \\nforth  its  strength  and  drove  the  evil  out  of  Mirkwood  -  and \\nthat  was  in  the  very  year  of  the  finding  of  this  Ring:  a  strange \\nchance,  if  chance  it  was. \\n\\n‘But  we  were  too  late,  as  Elrond  foresaw.  Sauron  also  had \\nwatched  us,  and  had  long  prepared  against  our  stroke,  gov¬ \\nerning  Mordor  from  afar  through  Minas  Morgul,  where  his \\nNine  servants  dwelt,  until  all  was  ready.  Then  he  gave  way \\nbefore  us,  but  only  feigned  to  flee,  and  soon  after  came  to \\nthe  Dark  Tower  and  openly  declared  himself.  Then  for  the \\nlast  time  the  Council  met;  for  now  we  learned  that  he  was \\nseeking  ever  more  eagerly  for  the  One.  We  feared  then  that \\nhe  had  some  news  of  it  that  we  knew  nothing  of.  But  Saruman \\nsaid  nay,  and  repeated  what  he  had  said  to  us  before:  that \\nthe  One  would  never  again  be  found  in  Middle-earth. \\n\\n‘  “At  the  worst,”  said  he,  “our  Enemy  knows  that  we  have \\nit  not,  and  that  it  still  is  lost.  But  what  was  lost  may  yet  be \\nfound,  he  thinks.  Fear  not!  Elis  hope  will  cheat  him.  Have  I \\nnot  earnestly  studied  this  matter?  Into  Anduin  the  Great  it \\nfell;  and  long  ago,  while  Sauron  slept,  it  was  rolled  down  the \\nRiver  to  the  Sea.  There  let  it  lie  until  the  End.”  ’ \\n\\nGandalf  fell  silent,  gazing  eastward  from  the  porch  to  the \\nfar  peaks  of  the  Misty  Mountains,  at  whose  great  roots  the \\nperil  of  the  world  had  so  long  lain  hidden.  He  sighed. \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n327 \\n\\n\\n‘There  I  was  at  fault,’  he  said.  ‘I  was  lulled  by  the  words \\nof  Saruman  the  Wise;  but  I  should  have  sought  for  the  truth \\nsooner,  and  our  peril  would  now  be  less.’ \\n\\nWe  were  all  at  fault,’  said  Elrond,  ‘and  but  for  your  vigil¬ \\nance  the  Darkness,  maybe,  would  already  be  upon  us.  But \\nsay  on!’ \\n\\n‘From  the  first  my  heart  misgave  me,  against  all  reason \\nthat  I  knew,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘and  I  desired  to  know  how  this \\nthing  came  to  Gollum,  and  how  long  he  had  possessed  it.  So \\nI  set  a  watch  for  him,  guessing  that  he  would  ere  long  come \\nforth  from  his  darkness  to  seek  for  his  treasure.  He  came,  but \\nhe  escaped  and  was  not  found.  And  then  alas!  I  let  the  matter \\nrest,  watching  and  waiting  only,  as  we  have  too  often  done. \\n\\n‘Time  passed  with  many  cares,  until  my  doubts  were  awak¬ \\nened  again  to  sudden  fear.  Whence  came  the  hobbit’s  ring? \\nWhat,  if  my  fear  was  true,  should  be  done  with  it?  Those \\nthings  I  must  decide.  But  I  spoke  yet  of  my  dread  to  none, \\nknowing  the  peril  of  an  untimely  whisper,  if  it  went  astray. \\nIn  all  the  long  wars  with  the  Dark  Tower  treason  has  ever \\nbeen  our  greatest  foe. \\n\\n‘That  was  seventeen  years  ago.  Soon  I  became  aware  that \\nspies  of  many  sorts,  even  beasts  and  birds,  were  gathered \\nround  the  Shire,  and  my  fear  grew.  I  called  for  the  help  of \\nthe  Dunedain,  and  their  watch  was  doubled;  and  I  opened \\nmy  heart  to  Aragorn,  the  heir  of  Isildur.’ \\n\\n‘And  I,’  said  Aragorn,  ‘counselled  that  we  should  hunt  for \\nGollum,  too  late  though  it  may  seem.  And  since  it  seemed  fit \\nthat  Isildur’s  heir  should  labour  to  repair  Isildur’s  fault,  I \\nwent  with  Gandalf  on  the  long  and  hopeless  search.’ \\n\\nThen  Gandalf  told  how  they  had  explored  the  whole  length \\nof  Wilderland,  down  even  to  the  Mountains  of  Shadow  and \\nthe  fences  of  Mordor.  ‘There  we  had  rumour  of  him,  and  we \\nguess  that  he  dwelt  there  long  in  the  dark  hills;  but  we  never \\nfound  him,  and  at  last  I  despaired.  And  then  in  my  despair  I \\nthought  again  of  a  test  that  might  make  the  finding  of  Gollum \\nunneeded.  The  ring  itself  might  tell  if  it  were  the  One.  The \\nmemory  of  words  at  the  Council  came  back  to  me:  words  of \\n\\n\\n328 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nSaruman,  half-heeded  at  the  time.  I  heard  them  now  clearly \\nin  my  heart. \\n\\n‘  “The  Nine,  the  Seven,  and  the  Three,”  he  said,  “had  each \\ntheir  proper  gem.  Not  so  the  One.  It  was  round  and \\nunadorned,  as  it  were  one  of  the  lesser  rings;  but  its  maker  set \\nmarks  upon  it  that  the  skilled,  maybe,  could  still  see  and  read.” \\n\\n‘What  those  marks  were  he  had  not  said.  Who  now  would \\nknow?  The  maker.  And  Saruman?  But  great  though  his  lore \\nmay  be,  it  must  have  a  source.  What  hand  save  Sauron’s  ever \\nheld  this  thing,  ere  it  was  lost?  The  hand  of  Isildur  alone. \\n\\nWith  that  thought,  I  forsook  the  chase,  and  passed  swiftly \\nto  Gondor.  In  former  days  the  members  of  my  order  had \\nbeen  well  received  there,  but  Saruman  most  of  all.  Often  he \\nhad  been  for  long  the  guest  of  the  Lords  of  the  City.  Less \\nwelcome  did  the  Lord  Denethor  show  me  then  than  of  old, \\nand  grudgingly  he  permitted  me  to  search  among  his  hoarded \\nscrolls  and  books. \\n\\n‘  “If  indeed  you  look  only,  as  you  say,  for  records  of  ancient \\ndays,  and  the  beginnings  of  the  City,  read  on!”  he  said.  “For \\nto  me  what  was  is  less  dark  than  what  is  to  come,  and  that  is \\nmy  care.  But  unless  you  have  more  skill  even  than  Saruman, \\nwho  has  studied  here  long,  you  will  find  naught  that  is  not \\nwell  known  to  me,  who  am  master  of  the  lore  of  this  City.” \\n\\n‘So  said  Denethor.  And  yet  there  lie  in  his  hoards  many \\nrecords  that  few  even  of  the  lore-masters  now  can  read,  for \\ntheir  scripts  and  tongues  have  become  dark  to  later  men.  And \\nBoromir,  there  lies  in  Minas  Tirith  still,  unread,  I  guess,  by \\nany  save  Saruman  and  myself  since  the  kings  failed,  a  scroll \\nthat  Isildur  made  himself.  For  Isildur  did  not  march  away \\nstraight  from  the  war  in  Mordor,  as  some  have  told  the  tale.’ \\n\\n‘Some  in  the  North,  maybe,’  Boromir  broke  in.  ‘All  know \\nin  Gondor  that  he  went  first  to  Minas  Anor  and  dwelt  a \\nwhile  with  his  nephew  Meneldil,  instructing  him,  before  he \\ncommitted  to  him  the  rule  of  the  South  Kingdom.  In  that \\ntime  he  planted  there  the  last  sapling  of  the  White  Tree  in \\nmemory  of  his  brother.’ \\n\\n‘But  in  that  time  also  he  made  this  scroll,’  said  Gandalf; \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n329 \\n\\n\\n‘and  that  is  not  remembered  in  Gondor,  it  would  seem.  For \\nthis  scroll  concerns  the  Ring,  and  thus  wrote  Isildur  therein: \\n\\nThe  Great  Ring  shall  go  now  to  be  an  heirloom  of  the \\nNorth  Kingdom;  but  records  of  it  shall  be  left  in  Gondor, \\nwhere  also  dwell  the  heirs  ofElendil,  lest  a  time  come  when \\nthe  memory  of  these  great  matters  shall  grow  dim. \\n\\n‘And  after  these  words  Isildur  described  the  Ring,  such  as  he \\nfound  it. \\n\\nIt  was  hot  when  I  first  took  it,  hot  as  a  glede,  and  my \\nhand  was  scorched,  so  that  I  doubt  if  ever  again  I  shall  be \\nfree  of  the  pain  of  it.  Yet  even  as  I  write  it  is  cooled,  and  it \\nseemeth  to  shrink,  though  it  loseth  neither  its  beauty  nor  its \\nshape.  Already  the  writing  upon  it,  which  at  first  was  as \\nclear  as  red  flame,  fadeth  and  is  now  only  barely  to  be \\nread.  It  is  fashioned  in  an  elven-script  of  Eregion,  for  they \\nhave  no  letters  in  Mordor  for  such  subtle  work;  but  the \\nlanguage  is  unknown  to  me.  I  deem  it  to  be  a  tongue  of  the \\nBlack  Land,  since  it  is  fold  and  uncouth.  What  evil  it  saith \\nI  do  not  know;  but  I  trace  here  a  copy  of  it,  lest  it  fade \\nbeyond  recall.  The  Ring  misseth,  maybe,  the  heat  of \\nSauron’s  hand,  which  was  black  and  yet  burned  like  fire, \\nand  so  Gil-galad  was  destroyed;  and  maybe  were  the  gold \\nmade  hot  again,  the  writing  would  be  refreshed.  But  for \\nmy  part  I  will  risk  no  hurt  to  this  thing:  of  all  the  works  of \\nSauron  the  only  fair.  It  is  precious  to  me,  though  I  buy  it \\nwith  great  pain. \\n\\n‘When  I  read  these  words,  my  quest  was  ended.  For  the \\ntraced  writing  was  indeed  as  Isildur  guessed,  in  the  tongue \\nof  Mordor  and  the  servants  of  the  Tower.  And  what  was  said \\ntherein  was  already  known.  For  in  the  day  that  Sauron  first \\nput  on  the  One,  Celebrimbor,  maker  of  the  Three,  was  aware \\nof  him,  and  from  afar  he  heard  him  speak  these  words,  and \\nso  his  evil  purposes  were  revealed. \\n\\n\\n330 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘At  once  I  took  my  leave  of  Denethor,  but  even  as  I  went \\nnorthwards,  messages  came  to  me  out  of  Lorien  that  Aragorn \\nhad  passed  that  way,  and  that  he  had  found  the  creature \\ncalled  Gollum.  Therefore  I  went  first  to  meet  him  and  hear \\nhis  tale.  Into  what  deadly  perils  he  had  gone  alone  I  dared \\nnot  guess.’ \\n\\n‘There  is  little  need  to  tell  of  them,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘If  a  man \\nmust  needs  walk  in  sight  of  the  Black  Gate,  or  tread  the \\ndeadly  flowers  of  Morgul  Vale,  then  perils  he  will  have.  I, \\ntoo,  despaired  at  last,  and  I  began  my  homeward  journey. \\nAnd  then,  by  fortune,  I  came  suddenly  on  what  I  sought:  the \\nmarks  of  soft  feet  beside  a  muddy  pool.  But  now  the  trail  was \\nfresh  and  swift,  and  it  led  not  to  Mordor  but  away.  Along  the \\nskirts  of  the  Dead  Marshes  I  followed  it,  and  then  I  had  him. \\nLurking  by  a  stagnant  mere,  peering  in  the  water  as  the  dark \\neve  fell,  I  caught  him,  Gollum.  He  was  covered  with  green \\nslime.  He  will  never  love  me,  I  fear;  for  he  bit  me,  and  I  was \\nnot  gentle.  Nothing  more  did  I  ever  get  from  his  mouth  than \\nthe  marks  of  his  teeth.  I  deemed  it  the  worst  part  of  all  my \\njourney,  the  road  back,  watching  him  day  and  night,  making \\nhim  walk  before  me  with  a  halter  on  his  neck,  gagged,  until \\nhe  was  tamed  by  lack  of  drink  and  food,  driving  him  ever \\ntowards  Mirkwood.  I  brought  him  there  at  last  and  gave  him \\nto  the  Elves,  for  we  had  agreed  that  this  should  be  done;  and \\nI  was  glad  to  be  rid  of  his  company,  for  he  stank.  For  my \\npart  I  hope  never  to  look  upon  him  again;  but  Gandalf  came \\nand  endured  long  speech  with  him.’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  long  and  weary,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘but  not  without \\nprofit.  For  one  thing,  the  tale  he  told  of  his  loss  agreed  with \\nthat  which  Bilbo  has  now  told  openly  for  the  first  time;  but \\nthat  mattered  little,  since  I  had  already  guessed  it.  But  I \\nlearned  then  first  that  Gollum’s  ring  came  out  of  the  Great \\nRiver  nigh  to  the  Gladden  Fields.  And  I  learned  also  that  he \\nhad  possessed  it  long.  Many  fives  of  his  small  kind.  The \\npower  of  the  ring  had  lengthened  his  years  far  beyond  their \\nspan;  but  that  power  only  the  Great  Rings  wield. \\n\\n‘And  if  that  is  not  proof  enough,  Galdor,  there  is  the  other \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n331 \\n\\n\\ntest  that  I  spoke  of.  Upon  this  very  ring  which  you  have  here \\nseen  held  aloft,  round  and  unadorned,  the  letters  that  Isildur \\nreported  may  still  be  read,  if  one  has  the  strength  of  will  to \\nset  the  golden  thing  in  the  fire  a  while.  That  I  have  done,  and \\nthis  I  have  read: \\n\\nAsh  nazg  diirhatuliik,  ash  nazg  gimbatul,  ash  nazg \\nthrakatuluk  agh  burzum-ishi  krimpatul.  ’ \\n\\nThe  change  in  the  wizard’s  voice  was  astounding.  Sud¬ \\ndenly  it  became  menacing,  powerful,  harsh  as  stone.  A \\nshadow  seemed  to  pass  over  the  high  sun,  and  the  porch  for \\na  moment  grew  dark.  All  trembled,  and  the  Elves  stopped \\ntheir  ears. \\n\\n‘Never  before  has  any  voice  dared  to  utter  words  of  that \\ntongue  in  Imladris,  Gandalf  the  Grey,’  said  Elrond,  as  the \\nshadow  passed  and  the  company  breathed  once  more. \\n\\n‘And  let  us  hope  that  none  will  ever  speak  it  here  again,’ \\nanswered  Gandalf.  ‘Nonetheless  I  do  not  ask  your  pardon, \\nMaster  Elrond.  For  if  that  tongue  is  not  soon  to  be  heard  in \\nevery  corner  of  the  West,  then  let  all  put  doubt  aside  that  this \\nthing  is  indeed  what  the  Wise  have  declared:  the  treasure  of \\nthe  Enemy,  fraught  with  all  his  malice;  and  in  it  lies  a  great \\npart  of  his  strength  of  old.  Out  of  the  Black  Years  come  the \\nwords  that  the  Smiths  of  Eregion  heard,  and  knew  that  they \\nhad  been  betrayed: \\n\\nOne  Ring  to  rule  them  all,  One  Ring  to  find  them,  One  Ring \\nto  bring  them  all  and  in  the  Darkness  bind  them. \\n\\n‘Know  also,  my  friends,  that  I  learned  more  yet  from \\nGollum.  He  was  loth  to  speak  and  his  tale  was  unclear,  but \\nit  is  beyond  all  doubt  that  he  went  to  Mordor,  and  there  all \\nthat  he  knew  was  forced  from  him.  Thus  the  Enemy  knows \\nnow  that  the  One  is  found,  that  it  was  long  in  the  Shire;  and \\nsince  his  servants  have  pursued  it  almost  to  our  door,  he  soon \\n\\n\\n332 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nwill  know,  already  he  may  know,  even  as  I  speak,  that  we \\nhave  it  here.’ \\n\\nAll  sat  silent  for  a  while,  until  at  length  Boromir  spoke.  ‘He \\nis  a  small  thing,  you  say,  this  Gollum?  Small,  but  great  in \\nmischief.  What  became  of  him?  To  what  doom  did  you  put \\nhim?’ \\n\\n‘He  is  in  prison,  but  no  worse,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘He  had \\nsuffered  much.  There  is  no  doubt  that  he  was  tormented, \\nand  the  fear  of  Sauron  lies  black  on  his  heart.  Still  I  for \\none  am  glad  that  he  is  safely  kept  by  the  watchful  Elves  of \\nMirkwood.  His  malice  is  great  and  gives  him  a  strength  hardly \\nto  be  believed  in  one  so  lean  and  withered.  He  could  work \\nmuch  mischief  still,  if  he  were  free.  And  I  do  not  doubt  that \\nhe  was  allowed  to  leave  Mordor  on  some  evil  errand.’ \\n\\n‘Alas!  alas!’  cried  Legolas,  and  in  his  fair  Elvish  face  there \\nwas  great  distress.  ‘The  tidings  that  I  was  sent  to  bring  must \\nnow  be  told.  They  are  not  good,  but  only  here  have  I  learned \\nhow  evil  they  may  seem  to  this  company.  Smeagol,  who  is \\nnow  called  Gollum,  has  escaped.’ \\n\\n‘Escaped?’  cried  Aragorn.  ‘That  is  ill  news  indeed.  We \\nshall  all  rue  it  bitterly,  I  fear.  How  came  the  folk  of  Thranduil \\nto  fail  in  their  trust?’ \\n\\n‘Not  through  lack  of  watchfulness,’  said  Legolas;  ‘but  per¬ \\nhaps  through  over-kindliness.  And  we  fear  that  the  prisoner \\nhad  aid  from  others,  and  that  more  is  known  of  our  doings \\nthan  we  could  wish.  We  guarded  this  creature  day  and  night, \\nat  Gandalf ’s  bidding,  much  though  we  wearied  of  the  task. \\nBut  Gandalf  bade  us  hope  still  for  his  cure,  and  we  had  not \\nthe  heart  to  keep  him  ever  in  dungeons  under  the  earth, \\nwhere  he  would  fall  back  into  his  old  black  thoughts.’ \\n\\n‘You  were  less  tender  to  me,’  said  Gloin  with  a  flash  of  his \\neyes,  as  old  memories  were  stirred  of  his  imprisonment  in \\nthe  deep  places  of  the  Elven-king’s  halls. \\n\\n‘Now  come!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Pray,  do  not  interrupt,  my \\ngood  Gloin.  That  was  a  regrettable  misunderstanding,  long \\nset  right.  If  all  the  grievances  that  stand  between  Elves  and \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND  333 \\n\\nDwarves  are  to  be  brought  up  here,  we  may  as  well  abandon \\nthis  Council.’ \\n\\nGloin  rose  and  bowed,  and  Legolas  continued.  ‘In  the  days \\nof  fair  weather  we  led  Gollum  through  the  woods;  and  there \\nwas  a  high  tree  standing  alone  far  from  the  others  which  he \\nliked  to  climb.  Often  we  let  him  mount  up  to  the  highest \\nbranches,  until  he  felt  the  free  wind;  but  we  set  a  guard  at \\nthe  tree’s  foot.  One  day  he  refused  to  come  down,  and  the \\nguards  had  no  mind  to  climb  after  him:  he  had  learned  the \\ntrick  of  clinging  to  boughs  with  his  feet  as  well  as  with  his \\nhands;  so  they  sat  by  the  tree  far  into  the  night. \\n\\n‘It  was  that  very  night  of  summer,  yet  moonless  and  star¬ \\nless,  that  Ores  came  on  us  at  unawares.  We  drove  them  off \\nafter  some  time;  they  were  many  and  fierce,  but  they  came \\nfrom  over  the  mountains,  and  were  unused  to  the  woods. \\nWhen  the  battle  was  over,  we  found  that  Gollum  was  gone, \\nand  his  guards  were  slain  or  taken.  It  then  seemed  plain  to  us \\nthat  the  attack  had  been  made  for  his  rescue,  and  that  he  knew \\nof  it  beforehand.  How  that  was  contrived  we  cannot  guess;  but \\nGollum  is  cunning,  and  the  spies  of  the  Enemy  are  many.  The \\ndark  things  that  were  driven  out  in  the  year  of  the  Dragon’s  fall \\nhave  returned  in  greater  numbers,  and  Mirkwood  is  again  an \\nevil  place,  save  where  our  realm  is  maintained. \\n\\nWe  have  failed  to  recapture  Gollum.  We  came  on  his  trail \\namong  those  of  many  Ores,  and  it  plunged  deep  into  the \\nForest,  going  south.  But  ere  long  it  escaped  our  skill,  and  we \\ndared  not  continue  the  hunt;  for  we  were  drawing  nigh  to  Dol \\nGuldur,  and  that  is  still  a  very  evil  place;  we  do  not  go  that  way.  ’ \\n\\nWell,  well,  he  is  gone,’  said  Gandalf.  We  have  no  time  to \\nseek  for  him  again.  He  must  do  what  he  will.  But  he  may \\nplay  a  part  yet  that  neither  he  nor  Sauron  have  foreseen. \\n\\n‘And  now  I  will  answer  Galdor’s  other  questions.  What  of \\nSaruman?  What  are  his  counsels  to  us  in  this  need?  This  tale \\nI  must  tell  in  full,  for  only  Elrond  has  heard  it  yet,  and  that \\nin  brief;  but  it  will  bear  on  all  that  we  must  resolve.  It  is  the \\nlast  chapter  in  the  Tale  of  the  Ring,  so  far  as  it  has  yet  gone. \\n\\n\\n334 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘At  the  end  of  June  I  was  in  the  Shire,  but  a  cloud  of  anxiety \\nwas  on  my  mind,  and  I  rode  to  the  southern  borders  of  the \\nlittle  land;  for  I  had  a  foreboding  of  some  danger,  still  hidden \\nfrom  me  but  drawing  near.  There  messages  reached  me  tell¬ \\ning  me  of  war  and  defeat  in  Gondor,  and  when  I  heard  of \\nthe  Black  Shadow  a  chill  smote  my  heart.  But  I  found  nothing \\nsave  a  few  fugitives  from  the  South;  yet  it  seemed  to  me  that \\non  them  sat  a  fear  of  which  they  would  not  speak.  I  turned \\nthen  east  and  north  and  journeyed  along  the  Greenway;  and \\nnot  far  from  Bree  I  came  upon  a  traveller  sitting  on  a  bank \\nbeside  the  road  with  his  grazing  horse  beside  him.  It  was \\nRadagast  the  Brown,  who  at  one  time  dwelt  at  Rhosgobel, \\nnear  the  borders  of  Mirkwood.  He  is  one  of  my  order,  but  I \\nhad  not  seen  him  for  many  a  year. \\n\\n‘“Gandalf!”  he  cried.  “I  was  seeking  you.  But  I  am  a \\nstranger  in  these  parts.  All  I  knew  was  that  you  might  be \\nfound  in  a  wild  region  with  the  uncouth  name  of  Shire.” \\n\\n‘  “Your  information  was  correct,”  I  said.  “But  do  not  put \\nit  that  way,  if  you  meet  any  of  the  inhabitants.  You  are  near \\nthe  borders  of  the  Shire  now.  And  what  do  you  want  with \\nme?  It  must  be  pressing.  You  were  never  a  traveller,  unless \\ndriven  by  great  need.” \\n\\n‘“I  have  an  urgent  errand,”  he  said.  “My  news  is  evil.” \\nThen  he  looked  about  him,  as  if  the  hedges  might  have  ears. \\n“Nazgul,”  he  whispered.  “The  Nine  are  abroad  again.  They \\nhave  crossed  the  River  secretly  and  are  moving  westward. \\nThey  have  taken  the  guise  of  riders  in  black.” \\n\\n‘I  knew  then  what  I  had  dreaded  without  knowing  it. \\n\\n‘  “The  Enemy  must  have  some  great  need  or  purpose,” \\nsaid  Radagast;  “but  what  it  is  that  makes  him  look  to  these \\ndistant  and  desolate  parts,  I  cannot  guess.” \\n\\n‘  “What  do  you  mean?”  said  I. \\n\\n‘  “I  have  been  told  that  wherever  they  go  the  Riders  ask  for \\nnews  of  a  land  called  Shire.” \\n\\n‘  “  The  Shire,”  I  said;  but  my  heart  sank.  For  even  the  Wise \\nmight  fear  to  withstand  the  Nine,  when  they  are  gathered \\ntogether  under  their  fell  chieftain.  A  great  king  and  sorcerer \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND  335 \\n\\nhe  was  of  old,  and  now  he  wields  a  deadly  fear.  “Who  told \\nyou,  and  who  sent  you?”  I  asked. \\n\\n‘  “Saruman  the  White,”  answered  Radagast.  “And  he  told \\nme  to  say  that  if  you  feel  the  need,  he  will  help;  but  you  must \\nseek  his  aid  at  once,  or  it  will  be  too  late.” \\n\\n‘And  that  message  brought  me  hope.  For  Saruman  the \\nWhite  is  the  greatest  of  my  order.  Radagast  is,  of  course,  a \\nworthy  Wizard,  a  master  of  shapes  and  changes  of  hue;  and \\nhe  has  much  lore  of  herbs  and  beasts,  and  birds  are  especially \\nhis  friends.  But  Saruman  has  long  studied  the  arts  of  the \\nEnemy  himself,  and  thus  we  have  often  been  able  to  forestall \\nhim.  It  was  by  the  devices  of  Saruman  that  we  drove  him  from \\nDol  Guldur.  It  might  be  that  he  had  found  some  weapons  that \\nwould  drive  back  the  Nine. \\n\\n‘  “I  will  go  to  Saruman,”  I  said. \\n\\n‘  “Then  you  must  go  now,”  said  Radagast;  “for  I  have \\nwasted  time  in  looking  for  you,  and  the  days  are  running \\nshort.  I  was  told  to  find  you  before  Midsummer,  and  that  is \\nnow  here.  Even  if  you  set  out  from  this  spot,  you  will  hardly \\nreach  him  before  the  Nine  discover  the  land  that  they  seek.  I \\nmyself  shall  turn  back  at  once.”  And  with  that  he  mounted \\nand  would  have  ridden  straight  off. \\n\\n‘  “Stay  a  moment!”  I  said.  “We  shall  need  your  help,  and \\nthe  help  of  all  things  that  will  give  it.  Send  out  messages  to \\nall  the  beasts  and  birds  that  are  your  friends.  Tell  them  to \\nbring  news  of  anything  that  bears  on  this  matter  to  Saruman \\nand  Gandalf.  Let  messages  be  sent  to  Orthanc.” \\n\\n‘  “I  will  do  that,”  he  said,  and  rode  off  as  if  the  Nine  were \\nafter  him. \\n\\n‘I  could  not  follow  him  then  and  there.  I  had  ridden  very \\nfar  already  that  day,  and  I  was  as  weary  as  my  horse;  and  I \\nneeded  to  consider  matters.  I  stayed  the  night  in  Bree,  and \\ndecided  that  I  had  no  time  to  return  to  the  Shire.  Never  did \\nI  make  a  greater  mistake! \\n\\n‘However,  I  wrote  a  message  to  Frodo,  and  trusted  to  my \\nfriend  the  innkeeper  to  send  it  to  him.  I  rode  away  at  dawn; \\n\\n\\n336 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nand  I  came  at  long  last  to  the  dwelling  of  Saruman.  That  is \\nfar  south  in  Isengard,  in  the  end  of  the  Misty  Mountains,  not \\nfar  from  the  Gap  of  Rohan.  And  Boromir  will  tell  you  that \\nthat  is  a  great  open  vale  that  lies  between  the  Misty  Mountains \\nand  the  northmost  foothills  of  Ered  Nimrais,  the  White \\nMountains  of  his  home.  But  Isengard  is  a  circle  of  sheer  rocks \\nthat  enclose  a  valley  as  with  a  wall,  and  in  the  midst  of  that \\nvalley  is  a  tower  of  stone  called  Orthanc.  It  was  not  made  by \\nSaruman,  but  by  the  Men  of  Numenor  long  ago;  and  it  is \\nvery  tall  and  has  many  secrets;  yet  it  looks  not  to  be  a  work \\nof  craft.  It  cannot  be  reached  save  by  passing  the  circle  of \\nIsengard;  and  in  that  circle  there  is  only  one  gate. \\n\\n‘Late  one  evening  I  came  to  the  gate,  like  a  great  arch  in \\nthe  wall  of  rock;  and  it  was  strongly  guarded.  But  the  keepers \\nof  the  gate  were  on  the  watch  for  me  and  told  me  that \\nSaruman  awaited  me.  I  rode  under  the  arch,  and  the  gate \\nclosed  silently  behind  me,  and  suddenly  I  was  afraid,  though \\nI  knew  no  reason  for  it. \\n\\n‘But  I  rode  to  the  foot  of  Orthanc,  and  came  to  the  stair  of \\nSaruman;  and  there  he  met  me  and  led  me  up  to  his  high \\nchamber.  He  wore  a  ring  on  his  finger. \\n\\n‘  “So  you  have  come,  Gandalf,”  he  said  to  me  gravely;  but \\nin  his  eyes  there  seemed  to  be  a  white  light,  as  if  a  cold \\nlaughter  was  in  his  heart. \\n\\n‘  “Yes,  I  have  come,”  I  said.  “I  have  come  for  your  aid, \\nSaruman  the  White.”  And  that  title  seemed  to  anger  him. \\n\\n“‘Have  you  indeed,  Gandalf  the  Grey!”  he  scoffed.  “For \\naid?  It  has  seldom  been  heard  of  that  Gandalf  the  Grey  sought \\nfor  aid,  one  so  cunning  and  so  wise,  wandering  about  the \\nlands,  and  concerning  himself  in  every  business,  whether  it \\nbelongs  to  him  or  not.” \\n\\n‘I  looked  at  him  and  wondered.  “But  if  I  am  not  deceived,” \\nsaid  I,  “things  are  now  moving  which  will  require  the  union \\nof  all  our  strength.” \\n\\n‘  “That  may  be  so,”  he  said,  “but  the  thought  is  late  in \\ncoming  to  you.  How  long,  I  wonder,  have  you  concealed \\nfrom  me,  the  head  of  the  Council,  a  matter  of  greatest  import? \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n337 \\n\\n\\nWhat  brings  you  now  from  your  lurking-place  in  the  Shire?” \\n\\n‘  “The  Nine  have  come  forth  again,”  I  answered.  “They \\nhave  crossed  the  River.  So  Radagast  said  to  me.” \\n\\n‘  “Radagast  the  Brown!”  laughed  Saruman,  and  he  no \\nlonger  concealed  his  scorn.  “Radagast  the  Bird-tamer!  Rada¬ \\ngast  the  Simple!  Radagast  the  Fool!  Yet  he  had  just  the  wit \\nto  play  the  part  that  I  set  him.  For  you  have  come,  and  that \\nwas  all  the  purpose  of  my  message.  And  here  you  will  stay, \\nGandalf  the  Grey,  and  rest  from  journeys.  For  I  am  Saruman \\nthe  Wise,  Saruman  Ring-maker,  Saruman  of  Many  Colours!” \\n\\n‘I  looked  then  and  saw  that  his  robes,  which  had  seemed \\nwhite,  were  not  so,  but  were  woven  of  all  colours,  and  if  he \\nmoved  they  shimmered  and  changed  hue  so  that  the  eye  was \\nbewildered. \\n\\n‘  “I  liked  white  better,”  I  said. \\n\\n“White!”  he  sneered.  “It  serves  as  a  beginning.  White \\ncloth  may  be  dyed.  The  white  page  can  be  overwritten;  and \\nthe  white  light  can  be  broken.” \\n\\n‘  “In  which  case  it  is  no  longer  white,”  said  I.  “And  he  that \\nbreaks  a  thing  to  find  out  what  it  is  has  left  the  path  of \\nwisdom.” \\n\\n‘  “You  need  not  speak  to  me  as  to  one  of  the  fools  that  you \\ntake  for  friends,”  said  he.  “I  have  not  brought  you  hither  to \\nbe  instructed  by  you,  but  to  give  you  a  choice.” \\n\\n‘He  drew  himself  up  then  and  began  to  declaim,  as  if  he \\nwere  malting  a  speech  long  rehearsed.  “The  Elder  Days  are \\ngone.  The  Middle  Days  are  passing.  The  Younger  Days  are \\nbeginning.  The  time  of  the  Elves  is  over,  but  our  time  is  at \\nhand:  the  world  of  Men,  which  we  must  rule.  But  we  must \\nhave  power,  power  to  order  all  things  as  we  will,  for  that  good \\nwhich  only  the  Wise  can  see. \\n\\n‘  “And  listen,  Gandalf,  my  old  friend  and  helper!”  he  said, \\ncoming  near  and  speaking  now  in  a  softer  voice.  “I  said  we, \\nfor  we  it  may  be,  if  you  will  join  with  me.  A  new  Power  is \\nrising.  Against  it  the  old  allies  and  policies  will  not  avail  us  at \\nall.  There  is  no  hope  left  in  Elves  or  dying  Numenor.  This \\nthen  is  one  choice  before  you,  before  us.  We  may  join  with \\n\\n\\n338 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nthat  Power.  It  would  be  wise,  Gandalf.  There  is  hope  that \\nway.  Its  victory  is  at  hand;  and  there  will  be  rich  reward  for \\nthose  that  aided  it.  As  the  Power  grows,  its  proved  friends \\nwill  also  grow;  and  the  Wise,  such  as  you  and  I,  may  with \\npatience  come  at  last  to  direct  its  courses,  to  control  it.  We \\ncan  bide  our  time,  we  can  keep  our  thoughts  in  our  hearts, \\ndeploring  maybe  evils  done  by  the  way,  but  approving  the \\nhigh  and  ultimate  purpose:  Knowledge,  Rule,  Order;  all  the \\nthings  that  we  have  so  far  striven  in  vain  to  accomplish, \\nhindered  rather  than  helped  by  our  weak  or  idle  friends. \\nThere  need  not  be,  there  would  not  be,  any  real  change  in \\nour  designs,  only  in  our  means.” \\n\\n‘  “Saruman,”  I  said,  “I  have  heard  speeches  of  this  kind \\nbefore,  but  only  in  the  mouths  of  emissaries  sent  from \\nMordor  to  deceive  the  ignorant.  I  cannot  think  that  you \\nbrought  me  so  far  only  to  weary  my  ears.” \\n\\n‘He  looked  at  me  sidelong,  and  paused  a  while  considering. \\n“Well,  I  see  that  this  wise  course  does  not  commend  itself \\nto  you,”  he  said.  “Not  yet?  Not  if  some  better  way  can  be \\ncontrived?” \\n\\n‘He  came  and  laid  his  long  hand  on  my  arm.  “And  why \\nnot,  Gandalf?”  he  whispered.  “Why  not?  The  Ruling  Ring? \\nIf  we  could  command  that,  then  the  Power  would  pass  to  us. \\nThat  is  in  truth  why  I  brought  you  here.  For  I  have  many \\neyes  in  my  service,  and  I  believe  that  you  know  where  this \\nprecious  thing  now  lies.  Is  it  not  so?  Or  why  do  the  Nine  ask \\nfor  the  Shire,  and  what  is  your  business  there?”  As  he  said \\nthis  a  lust  which  he  could  not  conceal  shone  suddenly  in  his \\neyes. \\n\\n‘“Saruman,”  I  said,  standing  away  from  him,  “only  one \\nhand  at  a  time  can  wield  the  One,  and  you  know  that  well, \\nso  do  not  trouble  to  say  we\\\\  But  I  would  not  give  it,  nay,  I \\nwould  not  give  even  news  of  it  to  you,  now  that  I  learn  your \\nmind.  You  were  head  of  the  Council,  but  you  have  unmasked \\nyourself  at  last.  Well,  the  choices  are,  it  seems,  to  submit  to \\nSauron,  or  to  yourself.  I  will  take  neither.  Have  you  others  to \\noffer?” \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n339 \\n\\n\\n‘He  was  cold  now  and  perilous.  “Yes,”  he  said.  “I  did  not \\nexpect  you  to  show  wisdom,  even  in  your  own  behalf;  but \\nI  gave  you  the  chance  of  aiding  me  willingly,  and  so  saving \\nyourself  much  trouble  and  pain.  The  third  choice  is  to  stay \\nhere,  until  the  end.” \\n\\n‘  “Until  what  end?” \\n\\n‘  “Until  you  reveal  to  me  where  the  One  may  be  found.  I \\nmay  find  means  to  persuade  you.  Or  until  it  is  found  in  your \\ndespite,  and  the  Ruler  has  time  to  turn  to  lighter  matters:  to \\ndevise,  say,  a  fitting  reward  for  the  hindrance  and  insolence \\nof  Gandalf  the  Grey.” \\n\\n‘  “That  may  not  prove  to  be  one  of  the  lighter  matters,” \\nsaid  I.  He  laughed  at  me,  for  my  words  were  empty,  and  he \\nknew  it. \\n\\n‘They  took  me  and  they  set  me  alone  on  the  pinnacle  of \\nOrthanc,  in  the  place  where  Saruman  was  accustomed  to \\nwatch  the  stars.  There  is  no  descent  save  by  a  narrow  stair \\nof  many  thousand  steps,  and  the  valley  below  seems  far  away. \\nI  looked  on  it  and  saw  that,  whereas  it  had  once  been  green \\nand  fair,  it  was  now  filled  with  pits  and  forges.  Wolves  and \\nores  were  housed  in  Isengard,  for  Saruman  was  mustering  a \\ngreat  force  on  his  own  account,  in  rivalry  of  Sauron  and  not \\nin  his  service,  yet.  Over  all  his  works  a  dark  smoke  hung  and \\nwrapped  itself  about  the  sides  of  Orthanc.  I  stood  alone  on \\nan  island  in  the  clouds;  and  I  had  no  chance  of  escape,  and \\nmy  days  were  bitter.  I  was  pierced  with  cold,  and  I  had  but \\nlittle  room  in  which  to  pace  to  and  fro,  brooding  on  the \\ncoming  of  the  Riders  to  the  North. \\n\\n‘That  the  Nine  had  indeed  arisen  I  felt  assured,  apart  from \\nthe  words  of  Saruman  which  might  be  lies.  Long  ere  I  came \\nto  Isengard  I  had  heard  tidings  by  the  way  that  could  not  be \\nmistaken.  Fear  was  ever  in  my  heart  for  my  friends  in  the \\nShire;  but  still  I  had  some  hope.  I  hoped  that  Frodo  had  set \\nforth  at  once,  as  my  letter  had  urged,  and  that  he  had  reached \\nRivendell  before  the  deadly  pursuit  began.  And  both  my  fear \\nand  my  hope  proved  ill-founded.  For  my  hope  was  founded \\n\\n\\n340 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\non  a  fat  man  in  Brce;  and  my  fear  was  founded  on  the \\ncunning  of  Sauron.  But  fat  men  who  sell  ale  have  many  calls \\nto  answer;  and  the  power  of  Sauron  is  still  less  than  fear \\nmakes  it.  But  in  the  circle  of  Isengard,  trapped  and  alone,  it \\nwas  not  easy  to  think  that  the  hunters  before  whom  all  have \\nfled  or  fallen  would  falter  in  the  Shire  far  away.’ \\n\\n‘I  saw  you!’  cried  Frodo.  ‘You  were  walking  backwards \\nand  forwards.  The  moon  shone  in  your  hair.’ \\n\\nGandalf  paused  astonished  and  looked  at  him.  ‘It  was  only \\na  dream,’  said  Frodo,  ‘but  it  suddenly  came  back  to  me.  I \\nhad  quite  forgotten  it.  It  came  some  time  ago;  after  I  left  the \\nShire,  I  think.’ \\n\\n‘Then  it  was  late  in  coming,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘as  you  will  see. \\nI  was  in  an  evil  plight.  And  those  who  know  me  will  agree \\nthat  I  have  seldom  been  in  such  need,  and  do  not  bear  such \\nmisfortune  well.  Gandalf  the  Grey  caught  like  a  fly  in  a  spi¬ \\nder’s  treacherous  web!  Yet  even  the  most  subtle  spiders  may \\nleave  a  weak  thread. \\n\\n‘At  first  I  feared,  as  Saruman  no  doubt  intended,  that  Rada- \\ngast  had  also  fallen.  Yet  I  had  caught  no  hint  of  anything \\nwrong  in  his  voice  or  in  his  eye  at  our  meeting.  If  I  had,  I \\nshould  never  have  gone  to  Isengard,  or  I  should  have  gone \\nmore  warily.  So  Saruman  guessed,  and  he  had  concealed \\nhis  mind  and  deceived  his  messenger.  It  would  have  been \\nuseless  in  any  case  to  try  and  win  over  the  honest  Radagast \\nto  treachery.  He  sought  me  in  good  faith,  and  so  persuaded \\nme. \\n\\n‘That  was  the  undoing  of  Saruman’s  plot.  For  Radagast \\nknew  no  reason  why  he  should  not  do  as  I  asked;  and  he  rode \\naway  towards  Mirkwood  where  he  had  many  friends  of  old. \\nAnd  the  Eagles  of  the  Mountains  went  far  and  wide,  and  they \\nsaw  many  things:  the  gathering  of  wolves  and  the  mustering \\nof  Ores;  and  the  Nine  Riders  going  hither  and  thither  in  the \\nlands;  and  they  heard  news  of  the  escape  of  Gollum.  And \\nthey  sent  a  messenger  to  bring  these  tidings  to  me. \\n\\n‘So  it  was  that  when  summer  waned,  there  came  a  night \\nof  moon,  and  Gwaihir  the  Windlord,  swiftest  of  the  Great \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n341 \\n\\n\\nEagles,  came  unlooked-for  to  Orthanc;  and  he  found  me \\nstanding  on  the  pinnacle.  Then  I  spoke  to  him  and  he  bore \\nme  away,  before  Saruman  was  aware.  I  was  far  from  Isengard, \\nere  the  wolves  and  ores  issued  from  the  gate  to  pursue  me. \\n\\n‘  “How  far  can  you  bear  me?”  I  said  to  Gwaihir. \\n\\n‘  “Many  leagues,”  said  he,  “but  not  to  the  ends  of  the \\nearth.  I  was  sent  to  bear  tidings  not  burdens.” \\n\\n‘  “Then  I  must  have  a  steed  on  land,”  I  said,  “and  a  steed \\nsurpassingly  swift,  for  I  have  never  had  such  need  of  haste \\nbefore.” \\n\\n‘  “Then  I  will  bear  you  to  Edoras,  where  the  Lord  of  Rohan \\nsits  in  his  halls,”  he  said;  “for  that  is  not  very  far  off.”  And  I \\nwas  glad,  for  in  the  Riddermark  of  Rohan  the  Rohirrim,  the \\nHorse-lords,  dwell,  and  there  are  no  horses  like  those  that  are \\nbred  in  that  great  vale  between  the  Misty  Mountains  and  the \\nWhite. \\n\\n‘  “Are  the  Men  of  Rohan  still  to  be  trusted,  do  you  think?” \\nI  said  to  Gwaihir,  for  the  treason  of  Saruman  had  shaken  my \\nfaith. \\n\\n‘  “They  pay  a  tribute  of  horses,”  he  answered,  “and  send \\nmany  yearly  to  Mordor,  or  so  it  is  said;  but  they  are  not  yet \\nunder  the  yoke.  But  if  Saruman  has  become  evil,  as  you  say, \\nthen  their  doom  cannot  be  long  delayed.” \\n\\n‘He  set  me  down  in  the  land  of  Rohan  ere  dawn;  and  now \\nI  have  lengthened  my  tale  over  long.  The  rest  must  be  more \\nbrief.  In  Rohan  I  found  evil  already  at  work:  the  lies  of \\nSaruman;  and  the  king  of  the  land  would  not  listen  to  my \\nwarnings.  He  bade  me  take  a  horse  and  be  gone;  and  I  chose \\none  much  to  my  liking,  but  little  to  his.  I  took  the  best  horse \\nin  his  land,  and  I  have  never  seen  the  like  of  him.’ \\n\\n‘Then  he  must  be  a  noble  beast  indeed,’  said  Aragorn;  ‘and \\nit  grieves  me  more  than  many  tidings  that  might  seem  worse \\nto  learn  that  Sauron  levies  such  tribute.  It  was  not  so  when \\nlast  I  was  in  that  land.’ \\n\\n‘Nor  is  it  now,  I  will  swear,’  said  Boromir.  ‘It  is  a  lie  that \\ncomes  from  the  Enemy.  I  know  the  Men  of  Rohan,  true  and \\n\\n\\n342 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nvaliant,  our  allies,  dwelling  still  in  the  lands  that  we  gave  them \\nlong  ago.’ \\n\\n‘The  shadow  of  Mordor  lies  on  distant  lands,’  answered \\nAragorn.  ‘Saruman  has  fallen  under  it.  Rohan  is  beset.  Who \\nknows  what  you  will  find  there,  if  ever  you  return?’ \\n\\n‘Not  this  at  least,’  said  Boromir,  ‘that  they  will  buy  their \\nlives  with  horses.  They  love  their  horses  next  to  their  kin. \\nAnd  not  without  reason,  for  the  horses  of  the  Riddermark \\ncome  from  the  fields  of  the  North,  far  from  the  Shadow,  and \\ntheir  race,  as  that  of  their  masters,  is  descended  from  the  free \\ndays  of  old.’ \\n\\n‘True  indeed!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘And  there  is  one  among  them \\nthat  might  have  been  foaled  in  the  morning  of  the  world.  The \\nhorses  of  the  Nine  cannot  vie  with  him;  tireless,  swift  as  the \\nflowing  wind.  Shadowfax  they  called  him.  By  day  his  coat \\nglistens  like  silver;  and  by  night  it  is  like  a  shade,  and  he \\npasses  unseen.  Light  is  his  footfall!  Never  before  had  any \\nman  mounted  him,  but  I  took  him  and  I  tamed  him,  and  so \\nspeedily  he  bore  me  that  I  reached  the  Shire  when  Frodo  was \\non  the  Barrow-downs,  though  I  set  out  from  Rohan  only \\nwhen  he  set  out  from  Hobbiton. \\n\\n‘But  fear  grew  in  me  as  I  rode.  Ever  as  I  came  north  I \\nheard  tidings  of  the  Riders,  and  though  I  gained  on  them  day \\nby  day,  they  were  ever  before  me.  They  had  divided  their \\nforces,  I  learned:  some  remained  on  the  eastern  borders,  not \\nfar  from  the  Greenway,  and  some  invaded  the  Shire  from  the \\nsouth.  I  came  to  Hobbiton  and  Frodo  had  gone;  but  I  had \\nwords  with  old  Gamgee.  Many  words  and  few  to  the  point. \\nHe  had  much  to  say  about  the  shortcomings  of  the  new \\nowners  of  Bag  End. \\n\\n‘  “I  can’t  abide  changes,”  said  he,  “not  at  my  time  of  life, \\nand  least  of  all  changes  for  the  worst.”  “Changes  for  the \\nworst,”  he  repeated  many  times. \\n\\n‘  “Worst  is  a  bad  word,”  I  said  to  him,  “and  I  hope  you  do \\nnot  live  to  see  it.”  But  amidst  his  talk  I  gathered  at  last  that \\nFrodo  had  left  Hobbiton  less  than  a  week  before,  and  that  a \\nblack  horseman  had  come  to  the  Hill  the  same  evening.  Then \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n343 \\n\\n\\nI  rode  on  in  fear.  I  came  to  Buckland  and  found  it  in  uproar, \\nas  busy  as  a  hive  of  ants  that  has  been  stirred  with  a  stick.  I \\ncame  to  the  house  at  Crickhollow,  and  it  was  broken  open \\nand  empty;  but  on  the  threshold  there  lay  a  cloak  that  had \\nbeen  Frodo’s.  Then  for  a  while  hope  left  me,  and  I  did  not \\nwait  to  gather  news,  or  I  might  have  been  comforted;  but  I \\nrode  on  the  trail  of  the  Riders.  It  was  hard  to  follow,  for  it \\nwent  many  ways,  and  I  was  at  a  loss.  But  it  seemed  to  me \\nthat  one  or  two  had  ridden  towards  Bree;  and  that  way  I  went, \\nfor  I  thought  of  words  that  might  be  said  to  the  innkeeper. \\n\\n‘  “Butterbur  they  call  him,”  thought  I.  “If  this  delay \\nwas  his  fault,  I  will  melt  all  the  butter  in  him.  I  will  roast  the \\nold  fool  over  a  slow  fire.”  He  expected  no  less,  and  when \\nhe  saw  my  face  he  fell  down  flat  and  began  to  melt  on  the \\nspot.’ \\n\\n‘What  did  you  do  to  him?’  cried  Frodo  in  alarm.  ‘He  was \\nreally  very  kind  to  us  and  did  all  that  he  could.’ \\n\\nGandalf  laughed.  ‘Don’t  be  afraid!’  he  said.  ‘I  did  not  bite, \\nand  I  barked  very  little.  So  overjoyed  was  I  by  the  news  that \\nI  got  out  of  him,  when  he  stopped  quaking,  that  I  embraced \\nthe  old  fellow.  How  it  had  happened  I  could  not  then  guess, \\nbut  I  learned  that  you  had  been  in  Bree  the  night  before,  and \\nhad  gone  off  that  morning  with  Strider. \\n\\n‘  “Strider!”  I  cried,  shouting  for  joy. \\n\\n“‘Yes,  sir,  I  am  afraid  so,  sir,”  said  Butterbur,  mistaking \\nme.  “He  got  at  them,  in  spite  of  all  that  I  could  do,  and  they \\ntook  up  with  him.  They  behaved  very  queer  all  the  time  they \\nwere  here:  wilful,  you  might  say.” \\n\\n‘  “Ass!  Fool!  Thrice  worthy  and  beloved  Barliman!”  said  I. \\n“It’s  the  best  news  I  have  had  since  Midsummer;  it’s  worth \\na  gold  piece  at  the  least.  May  your  beer  be  laid  under  an \\nenchantment  of  surpassing  excellence  for  seven  years!”  said \\nI.  “Now  I  can  take  a  night’s  rest,  the  first  since  I  have  forgot¬ \\nten  when.” \\n\\n‘So  I  stayed  there  that  night,  wondering  much  what  had \\nbecome  of  the  Riders;  for  only  of  two  had  there  yet  been  any \\n\\n\\n344 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nnews  in  Bree,  it  seemed.  But  in  the  night  we  heard  more. \\nFive  at  least  came  from  the  west,  and  they  threw  down  the \\ngates  and  passed  through  Bree  like  a  howling  wind;  and \\nthe  Bree-folk  are  still  shivering  and  expecting  the  end  of  the \\nworld.  I  got  up  before  dawn  and  went  after  them. \\n\\n‘I  do  not  know,  but  it  seems  clear  to  me  that  this  is  what \\nhappened.  Their  Captain  remained  in  secret  away  south  of \\nBree,  while  two  rode  ahead  through  the  village,  and  four \\nmore  invaded  the  Shire.  But  when  these  were  foiled  in  Bree \\nand  at  Crickhollow,  they  returned  to  their  Captain  with  tid¬ \\nings,  and  so  left  the  Road  unguarded  for  a  while,  except  by \\ntheir  spies.  The  Captain  then  sent  some  eastward  straight \\nacross  country,  and  he  himself  with  the  rest  rode  along  the \\nRoad  in  great  wrath. \\n\\n‘I  galloped  to  Weathertop  like  a  gale,  and  I  reached  it  before \\nsundown  on  my  second  day  from  Bree  -  and  they  were  there \\nbefore  me.  They  drew  away  from  me,  for  they  felt  the  coming \\nof  my  anger  and  they  dared  not  face  it  while  the  Sun  was  in \\nthe  sky.  But  they  closed  round  at  night,  and  I  was  besieged \\non  the  hill-top,  in  the  old  ring  of  Amon  Sul.  I  was  hard  put \\nto  it  indeed:  such  light  and  flame  cannot  have  been  seen  on \\nWeathertop  since  the  war-beacons  of  old. \\n\\n‘At  sunrise  I  escaped  and  fled  towards  the  north.  I  could \\nnot  hope  to  do  more.  It  was  impossible  to  find  you,  Frodo, \\nin  the  wilderness,  and  it  would  have  been  folly  to  try  with  all \\nthe  Nine  at  my  heels.  So  I  had  to  trust  to  Aragorn.  But  I \\nhoped  to  draw  some  of  them  off,  and  yet  reach  Rivendell \\nahead  of  you  and  send  out  help.  Four  Riders  did  indeed \\nfollow  me,  but  they  turned  back  after  a  while  and  made  for \\nthe  Ford,  it  seems.  That  helped  a  little,  for  there  were  only \\nfive,  not  nine,  when  your  camp  was  attacked. \\n\\n‘I  reached  here  at  last  by  a  long  hard  road,  up  the  Hoarwell \\nand  through  the  Ettenmoors,  and  down  from  the  north.  It \\ntook  me  nearly  fifteen  days  from  Weathertop,  for  I  could \\nnot  ride  among  the  rocks  of  the  troll-fells,  and  Shadowfax \\ndeparted.  I  sent  him  back  to  his  master;  but  a  great  friendship \\nhas  grown  between  us,  and  if  I  have  need  he  will  come  at  my \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n345 \\n\\n\\ncall.  But  so  it  was  that  I  came  to  Rivendell  only  two  days \\nbefore  the  Ring,  and  news  of  its  peril  had  already  been \\nbrought  here  -  which  proved  well  indeed. \\n\\n‘And  that,  Frodo,  is  the  end  of  my  account.  May  Elrond \\nand  the  others  forgive  the  length  of  it.  But  such  a  thing  has \\nnot  happened  before,  that  Gandalf  broke  tryst  and  did  not \\ncome  when  he  promised.  An  account  to  the  Ring-bearer  of \\nso  strange  an  event  was  required,  I  think. \\n\\n‘Well,  the  Tale  is  now  told,  from  first  to  last.  Here  we  all \\nare,  and  here  is  the  Ring.  But  we  have  not  yet  come  any \\nnearer  to  our  purpose.  What  shall  we  do  with  it?’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  silence.  At  last  Elrond  spoke  again. \\n\\n‘This  is  grievous  news  concerning  Saruman,’  he  said;  ‘for \\nwe  trusted  him  and  he  is  deep  in  all  our  counsels.  It  is  perilous \\nto  study  too  deeply  the  arts  of  the  Enemy,  for  good  or  for  ill. \\nBut  such  falls  and  betrayals,  alas,  have  happened  before.  Of \\nthe  tales  that  we  have  heard  this  day  the  tale  of  Frodo  was \\nmost  strange  to  me.  I  have  known  few  hobbits,  save  Bilbo \\nhere;  and  it  seems  to  me  that  he  is  perhaps  not  so  alone  and \\nsingular  as  I  had  thought  him.  The  world  has  changed  much \\nsince  I  last  was  on  the  westward  roads. \\n\\n‘The  Barrow-wights  we  know  by  many  names;  and  of  the \\nOld  Forest  many  tales  have  been  told:  all  that  now  remains \\nis  but  an  outlier  of  its  northern  march.  Time  was  when  a \\nsquirrel  could  go  from  tree  to  tree  from  what  is  now  the  Shire \\nto  Dunland  west  of  Isengard.  In  those  lands  I  journeyed  once, \\nand  many  things  wild  and  strange  I  knew.  But  I  had  forgotten \\nBombadil,  if  indeed  this  is  still  the  same  that  walked  the \\nwoods  and  hills  long  ago,  and  even  then  was  older  than  the \\nold.  That  was  not  then  his  name.  Iarwain  Ben-adar  we  called \\nhim,  oldest  and  fatherless.  But  many  another  name  he  has \\nsince  been  given  by  other  folk:  Forn  by  the  Dwarves,  Orald \\nby  Northern  Men,  and  other  names  beside.  He  is  a  strange \\ncreature,  but  maybe  I  should  have  summoned  him  to  our \\nCouncil.’ \\n\\n‘He  would  not  have  come,’  said  Gandalf. \\n\\n\\n346 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Could  we  not  still  send  messages  to  him  and  obtain  his \\nhelp?’  asked  Erestor.  ‘It  seems  that  he  has  a  power  even  over \\nthe  Ring.’ \\n\\n‘No,  I  should  not  put  it  so,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Say  rather  that \\nthe  Ring  has  no  power  over  him.  He  is  his  own  master.  But \\nhe  cannot  alter  the  Ring  itself,  nor  break  its  power  over  others. \\nAnd  now  he  is  withdrawn  into  a  little  land,  within  bounds \\nthat  he  has  set,  though  none  can  see  them,  waiting  perhaps \\nfor  a  change  of  days,  and  he  will  not  step  beyond  them.’ \\n\\n‘But  within  those  bounds  nothing  seems  to  dismay  him,’ \\nsaid  Erestor.  ‘Would  he  not  take  the  Ring  and  keep  it  there, \\nfor  ever  harmless?’ \\n\\n‘No,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘not  willingly.  He  might  do  so,  if  all  the \\nfree  folk  of  the  world  begged  him,  but  he  would  not  under¬ \\nstand  the  need.  And  if  he  were  given  the  Ring,  he  would  soon \\nforget  it,  or  most  likely  throw  it  away.  Such  things  have  no \\nhold  on  his  mind.  He  would  be  a  most  unsafe  guardian;  and \\nthat  alone  is  answer  enough.’ \\n\\n‘But  in  any  case,’  said  Glorfindel,  ‘to  send  the  Ring  to  him \\nwould  only  postpone  the  day  of  evil.  He  is  far  away.  We \\ncould  not  now  take  it  back  to  him,  unguessed,  unmarked  by \\nany  spy.  And  even  if  we  could,  soon  or  late  the  Lord  of  the \\nRings  would  learn  of  its  hiding  place  and  would  bend  all  his \\npower  towards  it.  Could  that  power  be  defied  by  Bombadil \\nalone?  I  think  not.  I  think  that  in  the  end,  if  all  else  is  con¬ \\nquered,  Bombadil  will  fall,  Last  as  he  was  First;  and  then \\nNight  will  come.’ \\n\\n‘I  know  little  of  Iarwain  save  the  name,’  said  Galdor;  ‘but \\nGlorfindel,  I  think,  is  right.  Power  to  defy  our  Enemy  is  not \\nin  him,  unless  such  power  is  in  the  earth  itself.  And  yet  we \\nsee  that  Sauron  can  torture  and  destroy  the  very  hills. \\nWhat  power  still  remains  lies  with  us,  here  in  Imladris,  or \\nwith  Cirdan  at  the  Havens,  or  in  Lorien.  But  have  they  the \\nstrength,  have  we  here  the  strength  to  withstand  the  Enemy, \\nthe  coming  of  Sauron  at  the  last,  when  all  else  is  overthrown?’ \\n\\n‘I  have  not  the  strength,’  said  Elrond;  ‘neither  have  they.’ \\n\\n‘Then  if  the  Ring  cannot  be  kept  from  him  for  ever  by \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND  347 \\n\\nstrength,’  said  Glorfindel,  ‘two  things  only  remain  for  us  to \\nattempt:  to  send  it  over  the  Sea,  or  to  destroy  it.’ \\n\\n‘But  Gandalf  has  revealed  to  us  that  we  cannot  destroy  it \\nby  any  craft  that  we  here  possess,’  said  Elrond.  ‘And  they \\nwho  dwell  beyond  the  Sea  would  not  receive  it:  for  good  or \\nill  it  belongs  to  Middle-earth;  it  is  for  us  who  still  dwell  here \\nto  deal  with  it.’ \\n\\n‘Then,’  said  Glorfindel,  ‘let  us  cast  it  into  the  deeps,  and \\nso  make  the  lies  of  Saruman  come  true.  For  it  is  clear  now \\nthat  even  at  the  Council  his  feet  were  already  on  a  crooked \\npath.  He  knew  that  the  Ring  was  not  lost  for  ever,  but  wished \\nus  to  think  so;  for  he  began  to  lust  for  it  for  himself.  Yet  oft \\nin  lies  truth  is  hidden:  in  the  Sea  it  would  be  safe.’ \\n\\n‘Not  safe  for  ever,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘There  are  many  things \\nin  the  deep  waters;  and  seas  and  lands  may  change.  And  it  is \\nnot  our  part  here  to  take  thought  only  for  a  season,  or  for  a \\nfew  lives  of  Men,  or  for  a  passing  age  of  the  world.  We  should \\nseek  a  final  end  of  this  menace,  even  if  we  do  not  hope  to \\nmake  one.’ \\n\\n‘And  that  we  shall  not  find  on  the  roads  to  the  Sea,’  said \\nGaldor.  ‘If  the  return  to  Iarwain  be  thought  too  dangerous, \\nthen  flight  to  the  Sea  is  now  fraught  with  gravest  peril.  My \\nheart  tells  me  that  Sauron  will  expect  us  to  take  the  western \\nway,  when  he  learns  what  has  befallen.  He  soon  will.  The \\nNine  have  been  unhorsed  indeed,  but  that  is  but  a  respite, \\nere  they  find  new  steeds  and  swifter.  Only  the  waning  might \\nof  Gondor  stands  now  between  him  and  a  march  in  power \\nalong  the  coasts  into  the  North;  and  if  he  comes,  assailing \\nthe  White  Towers  and  the  Havens,  hereafter  the  Elves  may \\nhave  no  escape  from  the  lengthening  shadows  of  Middle- \\nearth.’ \\n\\n‘Long  yet  will  that  march  be  delayed,’  said  Boromir. \\n‘Gondor  wanes,  you  say.  But  Gondor  stands,  and  even  the \\nend  of  its  strength  is  still  very  strong.’ \\n\\n‘And  yet  its  vigilance  can  no  longer  keep  back  the  Nine,’ \\nsaid  Galdor.  ‘And  other  roads  he  may  find  that  Gondor  does \\nnot  guard.’ \\n\\n\\n348 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Then,’  said  Erestor,  ‘there  are  but  two  courses,  as  Glor- \\nhndel  already  has  declared:  to  hide  the  Ring  for  ever;  or  to \\nunmake  it.  But  both  are  beyond  our  power.  Who  will  read \\nthis  riddle  for  us?’ \\n\\n‘None  here  can  do  so,’  said  Elrond  gravely.  ‘At  least  none \\ncan  foretell  what  will  come  to  pass,  if  we  take  this  road  or \\nthat.  But  it  seems  to  me  now  clear  which  is  the  road  that  we \\nmust  take.  The  westward  road  seems  easiest.  Therefore  it \\nmust  be  shunned.  It  will  be  watched.  Too  often  the  Elves \\nhave  fled  that  way.  Now  at  this  last  we  must  take  a  hard  road, \\na  road  unforeseen.  There  lies  our  hope,  if  hope  it  be.  To  walk \\ninto  peril  -  to  Mordor.  We  must  send  the  Ring  to  the  Fire.’ \\n\\nSilence  fell  again.  Frodo,  even  in  that  fair  house,  looking \\nout  upon  a  sunlit  valley  filled  with  the  noise  of  clear  waters, \\nfelt  a  dead  darkness  in  his  heart.  Boromir  stirred,  and  Frodo \\nlooked  at  him.  He  was  fingering  his  great  horn  and  frowning. \\nAt  length  he  spoke. \\n\\n‘I  do  not  understand  all  this,’  he  said.  ‘Saruman  is  a  traitor, \\nbut  did  he  not  have  a  glimpse  of  wisdom?  Why  do  you  speak \\never  of  hiding  and  destroying?  Why  should  we  not  think  that \\nthe  Great  Ring  has  come  into  our  hands  to  serve  us  in  the \\nvery  hour  of  need?  Wielding  it  the  Free  Lords  of  the  Free \\nmay  surely  defeat  the  Enemy.  That  is  what  he  most  fears, \\nI  deem. \\n\\n‘The  Men  of  Gondor  are  valiant,  and  they  will  never  sub¬ \\nmit;  but  they  may  be  beaten  down.  Valour  needs  first \\nstrength,  and  then  a  weapon.  Let  the  Ring  be  your  weapon, \\nif  it  has  such  power  as  you  say.  Take  it  and  go  forth  to \\nvictory!’ \\n\\n‘Alas,  no,’  said  Elrond.  ‘We  cannot  use  the  Ruling  Ring. \\nThat  we  now  know  too  well.  It  belongs  to  Sauron  and  was \\nmade  by  him  alone,  and  is  altogether  evil.  Its  strength, \\nBoromir,  is  too  great  for  anyone  to  wield  at  will,  save  only \\nthose  who  have  already  a  great  power  of  their  own.  But  for \\nthem  it  holds  an  even  deadlier  peril.  The  very  desire  of  it \\ncorrupts  the  heart.  Consider  Saruman.  If  any  of  the  Wise \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n349 \\n\\n\\nshould  with  this  Ring  overthrow  the  Lord  of  Mordor,  using \\nhis  own  arts,  he  would  then  set  himself  on  Sauron’s  throne, \\nand  yet  another  Dark  Lord  would  appear.  And  that  is  another \\nreason  why  the  Ring  should  be  destroyed:  as  long  as  it  is  in \\nthe  world  it  will  be  a  danger  even  to  the  Wise.  For  nothing  is \\nevil  in  the  beginning.  Even  Sauron  was  not  so.  I  fear  to  take \\nthe  Ring  to  hide  it.  I  will  not  take  the  Ring  to  wield  it.’ \\n\\n‘Nor  I,’  said  Gandalf. \\n\\nBoromir  looked  at  them  doubtfully,  but  he  bowed  his  head. \\n‘So  be  it,’  he  said.  ‘Then  in  Gondor  we  must  trust  to  such \\nweapons  as  we  have.  And  at  the  least,  while  the  Wise  ones \\nguard  this  Ring,  we  will  fight  on.  Mayhap  the  Sword-that- \\nwas-Broken  may  still  stem  the  tide  -  if  the  hand  that  wields \\nit  has  inherited  not  an  heirloom  only,  but  the  sinews  of  the \\nKings  of  Men.’ \\n\\nWho  can  tell?’  said  Aragorn.  ‘But  we  will  put  it  to  the  test \\none  day.’ \\n\\n‘May  the  day  not  be  too  long  delayed,’  said  Boromir.  ‘For \\nthough  I  do  not  ask  for  aid,  we  need  it.  It  would  comfort  us \\nto  know  that  others  fought  also  with  all  the  means  that  they \\nhave.’ \\n\\n‘Then  be  comforted,’  said  Elrond.  ‘For  there  are  other \\npowers  and  realms  that  you  know  not,  and  they  are  hidden \\nfrom  you.  Anduin  the  Great  flows  past  many  shores,  ere  it \\ncomes  to  Argonath  and  the  Gates  of  Gondor.’ \\n\\n‘Still  it  might  be  well  for  all,’  said  Gloin  the  Dwarf,  ‘if  all \\nthese  strengths  were  joined,  and  the  powers  of  each  were \\nused  in  league.  Other  rings  there  may  be,  less  treacherous, \\nthat  might  be  used  in  our  need.  The  Seven  are  lost  to  us  -  if \\nBalin  has  not  found  the  ring  of  Thror,  which  was  the  last; \\nnaught  has  been  heard  of  it  since  Thror  perished  in  Moria. \\nIndeed  I  may  now  reveal  that  it  was  partly  in  hope  to  find \\nthat  ring  that  Balin  went  away.’ \\n\\n‘Balin  will  find  no  ring  in  Moria,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Thror \\ngave  it  to  Thrain  his  son,  but  not  Thrain  to  Thorin.  It  was \\ntaken  with  torment  from  Thrain  in  the  dungeons  of  Dol \\nGuldur.  I  came  too  late.’ \\n\\n\\n350 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Ah,  alas!’  cried  Gloin.  ‘When  will  the  day  come  of  our \\nrevenge?  But  still  there  are  the  Three.  What  of  the  Three \\nRings  of  the  Elves?  Very  mighty  Rings,  it  is  said.  Do  not  the \\nElf-lords  keep  them?  Yet  they  too  were  made  by  the  Dark \\nLord  long  ago.  Are  they  idle?  I  see  Elf-lords  here.  Will  they \\nnot  say?’ \\n\\nThe  Elves  returned  no  answer.  ‘Did  you  not  hear  me, \\nGloin?’  said  Elrond.  ‘The  Three  were  not  made  by  Sauron, \\nnor  did  he  ever  touch  them.  But  of  them  it  is  not  permitted \\nto  speak.  So  much  only  in  this  hour  of  doubt  I  may  now  say. \\nThey  are  not  idle.  But  they  were  not  made  as  weapons  of \\nwar  or  conquest:  that  is  not  their  power.  Those  who  made \\nthem  did  not  desire  strength  or  domination  or  hoarded \\nwealth,  but  understanding,  making,  and  healing,  to  preserve \\nall  things  unstained.  These  things  the  Elves  of  Middle-earth \\nhave  in  some  measure  gained,  though  with  sorrow.  But  all \\nthat  has  been  wrought  by  those  who  wield  the  Three  will  turn \\nto  their  undoing,  and  their  minds  and  hearts  will  become \\nrevealed  to  Sauron,  if  he  regains  the  One.  It  would  be  better \\nif  the  Three  had  never  been.  That  is  his  purpose.’ \\n\\n‘But  what  then  would  happen,  if  the  Ruling  Ring  were \\ndestroyed,  as  you  counsel?’  asked  Gloin. \\n\\n‘We  know  not  for  certain,’  answered  Elrond  sadly.  ‘Some \\nhope  that  the  Three  Rings,  which  Sauron  has  never  touched, \\nwould  then  become  free,  and  their  rulers  might  heal  the  hurts \\nof  the  world  that  he  has  wrought.  But  maybe  when  the  One \\nhas  gone,  the  Three  will  fail,  and  many  fair  things  will  fade \\nand  be  forgotten.  That  is  my  belief.’ \\n\\n‘Yet  all  the  Elves  are  willing  to  endure  this  chance,’  said \\nGlorfindel,  ‘if  by  it  the  power  of  Sauron  may  be  broken,  and \\nthe  fear  of  his  dominion  be  taken  away  for  ever.’ \\n\\n‘Thus  we  return  once  more  to  the  destroying  of  the  Ring,’ \\nsaid  Erestor,  ‘and  yet  we  come  no  nearer.  What  strength  have \\nwe  for  the  finding  of  the  Fire  in  which  it  was  made?  That  is \\nthe  path  of  despair.  Of  folly  I  would  say,  if  the  long  wisdom \\nof  Elrond  did  not  forbid  me.’ \\n\\n‘Despair,  or  folly?’  said  Gandalf.  ‘It  is  not  despair,  for \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n351 \\n\\n\\ndespair  is  only  for  those  who  see  the  end  beyond  all  doubt. \\nWe  do  not.  It  is  wisdom  to  recognize  necessity,  when  all  other \\ncourses  have  been  weighed,  though  as  folly  it  may  appear  to \\nthose  who  cling  to  false  hope.  Well,  let  folly  be  our  cloak,  a \\nveil  before  the  eyes  of  the  Enemy!  For  he  is  very  wise,  and \\nweighs  all  things  to  a  nicety  in  the  scales  of  his  malice.  But \\nthe  only  measure  that  he  knows  is  desire,  desire  for  power; \\nand  so  he  judges  all  hearts.  Into  his  heart  the  thought  will  not \\nenter  that  any  will  refuse  it,  that  having  the  Ring  we  may \\nseek  to  destroy  it.  If  we  seek  this,  we  shall  put  him  out  of \\nreckoning.’ \\n\\n‘At  least  for  a  while,’  said  Elrond.  ‘The  road  must  be  trod, \\nbut  it  will  be  very  hard.  And  neither  strength  nor  wisdom  will \\ncarry  us  far  upon  it.  This  quest  may  be  attempted  by  the \\nweak  with  as  much  hope  as  the  strong.  Yet  such  is  oft  the \\ncourse  of  deeds  that  move  the  wheels  of  the  world:  small \\nhands  do  them  because  they  must,  while  the  eyes  of  the  great \\nare  elsewhere.’ \\n\\n‘Very  well,  very  well,  Master  Elrond!’  said  Bilbo  suddenly. \\n‘Say  no  more!  It  is  plain  enough  what  you  are  pointing  at. \\nBilbo  the  silly  hobbit  started  this  affair,  and  Bilbo  had  better \\nfinish  it,  or  himself.  I  was  very  comfortable  here,  and  getting \\non  with  my  book.  If  you  want  to  know,  I  am  just  writing  an \\nending  for  it.  I  had  thought  of  putting:  and  he  lived  happily \\never  afterwards  to  the  end  of  his  days.  It  is  a  good  ending,  and \\nnone  the  worse  for  having  been  used  before.  Now  I  shall  have \\nto  alter  that:  it  does  not  look  like  coming  true;  and  anyway \\nthere  will  evidently  have  to  be  several  more  chapters,  if  I  live \\nto  write  them.  It  is  a  frightful  nuisance.  When  ought  I  to \\nstart?’ \\n\\nBoromir  looked  in  surprise  at  Bilbo,  but  the  laughter  died \\non  his  lips  when  he  saw  that  all  the  others  regarded  the  old \\nhobbit  with  grave  respect.  Only  Gloin  smiled,  but  his  smile \\ncame  from  old  memories. \\n\\n‘Of  course,  my  dear  Bilbo,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘If  you  had  really \\nstarted  this  affair,  you  might  be  expected  to  finish  it.  But  you \\n\\n\\n352 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nknow  well  enough  now  that  starting  is  too  great  a  claim  for \\nany,  and  that  only  a  small  part  is  played  in  great  deeds  by \\nany  hero.  You  need  not  bow!  Though  the  word  was  meant, \\nand  we  do  not  doubt  that  under  jest  you  are  making  a  valiant \\noffer.  But  one  beyond  your  strength,  Bilbo.  You  cannot  take \\nthis  thing  back.  It  has  passed  on.  If  you  need  my  advice  any \\nlonger,  I  should  say  that  your  part  is  ended,  unless  as  a \\nrecorder.  Finish  your  book,  and  leave  the  ending  unaltered! \\nThere  is  still  hope  for  it.  But  get  ready  to  write  a  sequel,  when \\nthey  come  back.’ \\n\\nBilbo  laughed.  ‘I  have  never  known  you  give  me  pleasant \\nadvice  before,’  he  said.  ‘As  all  your  unpleasant  advice  has \\nbeen  good,  I  wonder  if  this  advice  is  not  bad.  Still,  I  don’t \\nsuppose  I  have  the  strength  or  luck  left  to  deal  with  the  Ring. \\nIt  has  grown,  and  I  have  not.  But  tell  me:  what  do  you  mean \\nby  they ?’ \\n\\n‘The  messengers  who  are  sent  with  the  Ring.’ \\n\\n‘Exactly!  And  who  are  they  to  be?  That  seems  to  me  what \\nthis  Council  has  to  decide,  and  all  that  it  has  to  decide. \\nElves  may  thrive  on  speech  alone,  and  Dwarves  endure  great \\nweariness;  but  I  am  only  an  old  hobbit,  and  I  miss  my  meal \\nat  noon.  Can’t  we  think  of  some  names  now?  Or  put  it  off \\ntill  after  dinner?’ \\n\\nNo  one  answered.  The  noon-bell  rang.  Still  no  one  spoke. \\nFrodo  glanced  at  all  the  faces,  but  they  were  not  turned  to \\nhim.  All  the  Council  sat  with  downcast  eyes,  as  if  in  deep \\nthought.  A  great  dread  fell  on  him,  as  if  he  was  awaiting  the \\npronouncement  of  some  doom  that  he  had  long  foreseen  and \\nvainly  hoped  might  after  all  never  be  spoken.  An  overwhelm¬ \\ning  longing  to  rest  and  remain  at  peace  by  Bilbo’s  side  in \\nRivendell  filled  all  his  heart.  At  last  with  an  effort  he  spoke, \\nand  wondered  to  hear  his  own  words,  as  if  some  other  will \\nwas  using  his  small  voice. \\n\\n‘I  will  take  the  Ring,’  he  said,  ‘though  I  do  not  know  the \\nway.’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  COUNCIL  OF  ELROND \\n\\n\\n353 \\n\\n\\nElrond  raised  his  eyes  and  looked  at  him,  and  Frodo  felt \\nhis  heart  pierced  by  the  sudden  keenness  of  the  glance.  ‘If  I \\nunderstand  aright  all  that  I  have  heard,’  he  said,  ‘I  think  that \\nthis  task  is  appointed  for  you,  Frodo;  and  that  if  you  do  not \\nfind  a  way,  no  one  will.  This  is  the  hour  of  the  Shire-folk, \\nwhen  they  arise  from  their  quiet  fields  to  shake  the  towers \\nand  counsels  of  the  Great.  Who  of  all  the  Wise  could  have \\nforeseen  it?  Or,  if  they  are  wise,  why  should  they  expect  to \\nknow  it,  until  the  hour  has  struck? \\n\\n‘But  it  is  a  heavy  burden.  So  heavy  that  none  could  lay  it \\non  another.  I  do  not  lay  it  on  you.  But  if  you  take  it  freely,  I \\nwill  say  that  your  choice  is  right;  and  though  all  the  mighty \\nElf-friends  of  old,  Hador,  and  Hurin,  and  Turin,  and  Beren \\nhimself  were  assembled  together,  your  seat  should  be  among \\nthem.’ \\n\\n‘But  you  won’t  send  him  off  alone  surely,  Master?’  cried \\nSam,  unable  to  contain  himself  any  longer,  and  jumping  up \\nfrom  the  corner  where  he  had  been  quietly  sitting  on  the \\nfloor. \\n\\n‘No  indeed!’  said  Elrond,  turning  towards  him  with  a  smile. \\n‘You  at  least  shall  go  with  him.  It  is  hardly  possible  to  separate \\nyou  from  him,  even  when  he  is  summoned  to  a  secret  council \\nand  you  are  not.’ \\n\\nSam  sat  down,  blushing  and  muttering.  ‘A  nice  pickle  we \\nhave  landed  ourselves  in,  Mr.  Frodo!’  he  said,  shaking  his \\nhead. \\n\\n\\nChapter  3 \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\nLater  that  day  the  hobbits  held  a  meeting  of  their  own  in \\nBilbo’s  room.  Merry  and  Pippin  were  indignant  when  they \\nheard  that  Sam  had  crept  into  the  Council,  and  had  been \\nchosen  as  Frodo’s  companion. \\n\\n‘It’s  most  unfair,’  said  Pippin.  ‘Instead  of  throwing  him \\nout,  and  clapping  him  in  chains,  Elrond  goes  and  rewards \\nhim  for  his  cheek!’ \\n\\n‘Rewards!’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  can’t  imagine  a  more  severe  pun¬ \\nishment.  You  are  not  thinking  what  you  are  saying:  con¬ \\ndemned  to  go  on  this  hopeless  journey,  a  reward?  Yesterday \\nI  dreamed  that  my  task  was  done,  and  I  could  rest  here,  a \\nlong  while,  perhaps  for  good.’ \\n\\n‘I  don’t  wonder,’  said  Merry,  ‘and  I  wish  you  could.  But \\nwe  are  envying  Sam,  not  you.  If  you  have  to  go,  then  it  will \\nbe  a  punishment  for  any  of  us  to  be  left  behind,  even  in \\nRivendell.  We  have  come  a  long  way  with  you  and  been \\nthrough  some  stiff  times.  We  want  to  go  on.’ \\n\\n‘That’s  what  I  meant,’  said  Pippin.  We  hobbits  ought  to \\nstick  together,  and  we  will.  I  shall  go,  unless  they  chain  me \\nup.  There  must  be  someone  with  intelligence  in  the  party.’ \\n\\n‘Then  you  certainly  will  not  be  chosen,  Peregrin  Took!’ \\nsaid  Gandalf,  looking  in  through  the  window,  which  was  near \\nthe  ground.  ‘But  you  are  all  worrying  yourselves  unnecess¬ \\narily.  Nothing  is  decided  yet.’ \\n\\n‘Nothing  decided!’  cried  Pippin.  ‘Then  what  were  you  all \\ndoing?  You  were  shut  up  for  hours.’ \\n\\n‘Talking,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘There  was  a  deal  of  talk,  and  every¬ \\none  had  an  eye-opener.  Even  old  Gandalf.  I  think  Legolas’s \\nbit  of  news  about  Gollum  caught  even  him  on  the  hop, \\nthough  he  passed  it  off.’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n355 \\n\\n\\n‘You  were  wrong,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘You  were  inattentive.  I \\nhad  already  heard  of  it  from  Gwaihir.  If  you  want  to  know, \\nthe  only  real  eye-openers,  as  you  put  it,  were  you  and  Frodo; \\nand  I  was  the  only  one  that  was  not  surprised.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  anyway,’  said  Bilbo,  ‘nothing  was  decided  beyond \\nchoosing  poor  Frodo  and  Sam.  I  was  afraid  all  the  time  that \\nit  might  come  to  that,  if  I  was  let  off.  But  if  you  ask  me, \\nElrond  will  send  out  a  fair  number,  when  the  reports  come \\nin.  Have  they  started  yet,  Gandalf?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  the  wizard.  ‘Some  of  the  scouts  have  been  sent \\nout  already.  More  will  go  tomorrow.  Elrond  is  sending  Elves, \\nand  they  will  get  in  touch  with  the  Rangers,  and  maybe  with \\nThranduil’s  folk  in  Mirkwood.  And  Aragorn  has  gone  with \\nElrond’s  sons.  We  shall  have  to  scour  the  lands  all  round  for \\nmany  long  leagues  before  any  move  is  made.  So  cheer  up, \\nFrodo!  You  will  probably  make  quite  a  long  stay  here.’ \\n\\n‘Ah!’  said  Sam  gloomily.  ‘We’ll  just  wait  long  enough  for \\nwinter  to  come.’ \\n\\n‘That  can’t  be  helped,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘It’s  your  fault  partly, \\nFrodo  my  lad:  insisting  on  waiting  for  my  birthday.  A  funny \\nway  of  honouring  it,  I  can’t  help  thinking.  Not  the  day  I \\nshould  have  chosen  for  letting  the  S.-B.s  into  Bag  End.  But \\nthere  it  is:  you  can’t  wait  now  till  spring;  and  you  can’t  go  till \\nthe  reports  come  back. \\n\\nWhen  winter  first  begins  to  bite \\nand  stones  crack  in  the  frosty  night, \\nwhen  pools  are  black  and  trees  are  bare, \\n\\n’tis  evil  in  the  Wild  to  fare. \\n\\nBut  that  I  am  afraid  will  be  just  your  luck.’ \\n\\n‘I  am  afraid  it  will,’  said  Gandalf.  We  can’t  start  until  we \\nhave  found  out  about  the  Riders.’ \\n\\n‘I  thought  they  were  all  destroyed  in  the  flood,’  said  Merry. \\n\\n‘You  cannot  destroy  Ringwraiths  like  that,’  said  Gandalf. \\n‘The  power  of  their  master  is  in  them,  and  they  stand  or  fall \\nby  him.  We  hope  that  they  were  all  unhorsed  and  unmasked, \\n\\n\\n356 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nand  so  made  for  a  while  less  dangerous;  but  we  must  find  out \\nfor  certain.  In  the  meantime  you  should  try  and  forget  your \\ntroubles,  Frodo.  I  do  not  know  if  I  can  do  anything  to  help \\nyou;  but  I  will  whisper  this  in  your  ears.  Someone  said  that \\nintelligence  would  be  needed  in  the  party.  He  was  right.  I \\nthink  I  shall  come  with  you.’ \\n\\nSo  great  was  Frodo’s  delight  at  this  announcement  that \\nGandalf  left  the  window-sill,  where  he  had  been  sitting,  and \\ntook  off  his  hat  and  bowed.  ‘I  only  said  I  think  I  shall  come. \\nDo  not  count  on  anything  yet.  In  this  matter  Elrond  will  have \\nmuch  to  say,  and  your  friend  the  Strider.  Which  reminds  me, \\nI  want  to  see  Elrond.  I  must  be  off.’ \\n\\n‘How  long  do  you  think  I  shall  have  here?’  said  Frodo  to \\nBilbo  when  Gandalf  had  gone. \\n\\n‘Oh,  I  don’t  know.  I  can’t  count  days  in  Rivendell,’  said \\nBilbo.  ‘But  quite  long,  I  should  think.  We  can  have  many  a \\ngood  talk.  What  about  helping  me  with  my  book,  and  making \\na  start  on  the  next?  Have  you  thought  of  an  ending?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  several,  and  all  are  dark  and  unpleasant,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Oh,  that  won’t  do!’  said  Bilbo.  ‘Books  ought  to  have  good \\nendings.  How  would  this  do:  and  they  all  settled  down  and \\nlived  together  happily  ever  after ?’ \\n\\n‘It  will  do  well,  if  it  ever  comes  to  that,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Ah!’  said  Sam.  ‘And  where  will  they  five?  That’s  what  I \\noften  wonder.  ’ \\n\\nFor  a  while  the  hobbits  continued  to  talk  and  think  of  the \\npast  journey  and  of  the  perils  that  lay  ahead;  but  such  was \\nthe  virtue  of  the  land  of  Rivendell  that  soon  all  fear  and \\nanxiety  was  lifted  from  their  minds.  The  future,  good  or  ill, \\nwas  not  forgotten,  but  ceased  to  have  any  power  over  the \\npresent.  Health  and  hope  grew  strong  in  them,  and  they  were \\ncontent  with  each  good  day  as  it  came,  taking  pleasure  in \\nevery  meal,  and  in  every  word  and  song. \\n\\nSo  the  days  slipped  away,  as  each  morning  dawned  bright \\nand  fair,  and  each  evening  followed  cool  and  clear.  But \\nautumn  was  waning  fast;  slowly  the  golden  light  faded  to  pale \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n357 \\n\\n\\nsilver,  and  the  lingering  leaves  fell  from  the  naked  trees.  A \\nwind  began  to  blow  chill  from  the  Misty  Mountains  to  the \\neast.  The  Hunter’s  Moon  waxed  round  in  the  night  sky,  and \\nput  to  flight  all  the  lesser  stars.  But  low  in  the  South  one  star \\nshone  red.  Every  night,  as  the  Moon  waned  again,  it  shone \\nbrighter  and  brighter.  Frodo  could  see  it  from  his  window, \\ndeep  in  the  heavens,  burning  like  a  watchful  eye  that  glared \\nabove  the  trees  on  the  brink  of  the  valley. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  had  been  nearly  two  months  in  the  house  of \\nElrond,  and  November  had  gone  by  with  the  last  shreds  of \\nautumn,  and  December  was  passing,  when  the  scouts  began \\nto  return.  Some  had  gone  north  beyond  the  springs  of  the \\nHoarwell  into  the  Ettenmoors;  and  others  had  gone  west,  and \\nwith  the  help  of  Aragorn  and  the  Rangers  had  searched  the \\nlands  far  down  the  Greyflood,  as  far  as  Tharbad,  where  the \\nold  North  Road  crossed  the  river  by  a  ruined  town.  Many \\nhad  gone  east  and  south;  and  some  of  these  had  crossed  the \\nMountains  and  entered  Mirkwood,  while  others  had  climbed \\nthe  pass  at  the  sources  of  the  Gladden  River,  and  had  come \\ndown  into  Wilderland  and  over  the  Gladden  Fields  and  so  at \\nlength  had  reached  the  old  home  of  Radagast  at  Rhosgobel. \\nRadagast  was  not  there;  and  they  had  returned  over  the  high \\npass  that  was  called  the  Redhorn  Gate.  The  sons  of  Elrond, \\nElladan  and  Elrohir,  were  the  last  to  return;  they  had  made  a \\ngreat  journey,  passing  down  the  Silverlode  into  a  strange \\ncountry,  but  of  their  errand  they  would  not  speak  to  any  save \\nto  Elrond. \\n\\nIn  no  region  had  the  messengers  discovered  any  signs  or \\ntidings  of  the  Riders  or  other  servants  of  the  Enemy.  Even \\nfrom  the  Eagles  of  the  Misty  Mountains  they  had  learned  no \\nfresh  news.  Nothing  had  been  seen  or  heard  of  Gollum;  but \\nthe  wild  wolves  were  still  gathering,  and  were  hunting  again \\nfar  up  the  Great  River.  Three  of  the  black  horses  had  been \\nfound  at  once  drowned  in  the  flooded  Ford.  On  the  rocks  of \\nthe  rapids  below  it  searchers  discovered  the  bodies  of  five \\nmore,  and  also  a  long  black  cloak,  slashed  and  tattered.  Of \\n\\n\\n358 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nthe  Black  Riders  no  other  trace  was  to  be  seen,  and  nowhere \\nwas  their  presence  to  be  felt.  It  seemed  that  they  had  vanished \\nfrom  the  North. \\n\\n‘Eight  out  of  the  Nine  are  accounted  for  at  least,’  said \\nGandalf.  ‘It  is  rash  to  be  too  sure,  yet  I  think  that  we  may \\nhope  now  that  the  Ringwraiths  were  scattered,  and  have  been \\nobliged  to  return  as  best  they  could  to  their  Master  in  Mordor, \\nempty  and  shapeless. \\n\\n‘If  that  is  so,  it  will  be  some  time  before  they  can  begin  the \\nhunt  again.  Of  course  the  Enemy  has  other  servants,  but  they \\nwill  have  to  journey  all  the  way  to  the  borders  of  Rivendell \\nbefore  they  can  pick  up  our  trail.  And  if  we  are  careful  that \\nwill  be  hard  to  find.  But  we  must  delay  no  longer.’ \\n\\nElrond  summoned  the  hobbits  to  him.  He  looked  gravely \\nat  Frodo.  ‘The  time  has  come,’  he  said.  ‘If  the  Ring  is  to  set \\nout,  it  must  go  soon.  But  those  who  go  with  it  must  not  count \\non  their  errand  being  aided  by  war  or  force.  They  must  pass \\ninto  the  domain  of  the  Enemy  far  from  aid.  Do  you  still  hold \\nto  your  word,  Frodo,  that  you  will  be  the  Ring-bearer?’ \\n\\n‘I  do,’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  will  go  with  Sam.’ \\n\\n‘Then  I  cannot  help  you  much,  not  even  with  counsel,’ \\nsaid  Elrond.  ‘I  can  foresee  very  little  of  your  road;  and  how \\nyour  task  is  to  be  achieved  I  do  not  know.  The  Shadow  has \\ncrept  now  to  the  feet  of  the  Mountains,  and  draws  nigh  even \\nto  the  borders  of  the  Greyflood;  and  under  the  Shadow  all  is \\ndark  to  me.  You  will  meet  many  foes,  some  open,  and  some \\ndisguised;  and  you  may  find  friends  upon  your  way  when \\nyou  least  look  for  it.  I  will  send  out  messages,  such  as  I  can \\ncontrive,  to  those  whom  I  know  in  the  wide  world;  but  so \\nperilous  are  the  lands  now  become  that  some  may  well  mis¬ \\ncarry,  or  come  no  quicker  than  you  yourself. \\n\\n‘And  I  will  choose  you  companions  to  go  with  you,  as  far \\nas  they  will  or  fortune  allows.  The  number  must  be  few,  since \\nyour  hope  is  in  speed  and  secrecy.  Had  I  a  host  of  Elves  in \\narmour  of  the  Elder  Days,  it  would  avail  little,  save  to  arouse \\nthe  power  of  Mordor. \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n359 \\n\\n\\n‘The  Company  of  the  Ring  shall  be  Nine;  and  the  Nine \\nWalkers  shall  be  set  against  the  Nine  Riders  that  are  evil. \\nWith  you  and  your  faithful  servant,  Gandalf  will  go;  for  this \\nshall  be  his  great  task,  and  maybe  the  end  of  his  labours. \\n\\n‘For  the  rest,  they  shall  represent  the  other  Free  Peoples  of \\nthe  World:  Elves,  Dwarves,  and  Men.  Legolas  shall  be  for \\nthe  Elves;  and  Gimli  son  of  Gloin  for  the  Dwarves.  They  are \\nwilling  to  go  at  least  to  the  passes  of  the  Mountains,  and \\nmaybe  beyond.  For  men  you  shall  have  Aragorn  son  of \\nArathorn,  for  the  Ring  of  Isildur  concerns  him  closely.’ \\n\\n‘Strider!’  cried  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Yes,’  he  said  with  a  smile.  ‘I  ask  leave  once  again  to  be \\nyour  companion,  Frodo.’ \\n\\n‘I  would  have  begged  you  to  come,’  said  Frodo,  ‘only  I \\nthought  you  were  going  to  Minas  Tirith  with  Boromir.’ \\n\\n‘I  am,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘And  the  Sword-that-was-Broken \\nshall  be  re -forged  ere  I  set  out  to  war.  But  your  road  and  our \\nroad  lie  together  for  many  hundreds  of  miles.  There¬ \\nfore  Boromir  will  also  be  in  the  Company.  He  is  a  valiant \\nman.’ \\n\\n‘There  remain  two  more  to  be  found,’  said  Elrond.  ‘These \\nI  will  consider.  Of  my  household  I  may  find  some  that  it \\nseems  good  to  me  to  send.’ \\n\\n‘But  that  will  leave  no  place  for  us!’  cried  Pippin  in  dismay. \\nWe  don’t  want  to  be  left  behind.  We  want  to  go  with  Frodo.’ \\n\\n‘That  is  because  you  do  not  understand  and  cannot \\nimagine  what  lies  ahead,’  said  Elrond. \\n\\n‘Neither  does  Frodo,’  said  Gandalf,  unexpectedly  support¬ \\ning  Pippin.  ‘Nor  do  any  of  us  see  clearly.  It  is  true  that  if \\nthese  hobbits  understood  the  danger,  they  would  not  dare  to \\ngo.  But  they  would  still  wish  to  go,  or  wish  that  they  dared, \\nand  be  shamed  and  unhappy.  I  think,  Elrond,  that  in  this \\nmatter  it  would  be  well  to  trust  rather  to  their  friendship  than \\nto  great  wisdom.  Even  if  you  chose  for  us  an  Elf-lord,  such \\nas  Glorfindel,  he  could  not  storm  the  Dark  Tower,  nor  open \\nthe  road  to  the  Fire  by  the  power  that  is  in  him.’ \\n\\n‘You  speak  gravely,’  said  Elrond,  ‘but  I  am  in  doubt.  The \\n\\n\\n360  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nShire,  I  forebode,  is  not  free  now  from  peril;  and  these  two \\nI  had  thought  to  send  back  there  as  messengers,  to  do  what \\nthey  could,  according  to  the  fashion  of  their  country,  to  warn \\nthe  people  of  their  danger.  In  any  case,  I  judge  that  the \\nyounger  of  these  two,  Peregrin  Took,  should  remain.  My \\nheart  is  against  his  going.’ \\n\\n‘Then,  Master  Elrond,  you  will  have  to  lock  me  in  prison, \\nor  send  me  home  tied  in  a  sack,’  said  Pippin.  ‘For  otherwise \\nI  shall  follow  the  Company.’ \\n\\n‘Let  it  be  so  then.  You  shall  go,’  said  Elrond,  and  he  sighed. \\n‘Now  the  tale  of  Nine  is  filled.  In  seven  days  the  Company \\nmust  depart.’ \\n\\nThe  Sword  of  Elendil  was  forged  anew  by  Elvish  smiths, \\nand  on  its  blade  was  traced  a  device  of  seven  stars  set  between \\nthe  crescent  Moon  and  the  rayed  Sun,  and  about  them  was \\nwritten  many  runes;  for  Aragorn  son  of  Arathorn  was  going \\nto  war  upon  the  marches  of  Mordor.  Very  bright  was  that \\nsword  when  it  was  made  whole  again;  the  light  of  the  sun \\nshone  redly  in  it,  and  the  light  of  the  moon  shone  cold,  and \\nits  edge  was  hard  and  keen.  And  Aragorn  gave  it  a  new  name \\nand  called  it  Anduril,  Flame  of  the  West. \\n\\nAragorn  and  Gandalf  walked  together  or  sat  speaking  of \\ntheir  road  and  the  perils  they  would  meet;  and  they  pondered \\nthe  storied  and  figured  maps  and  books  of  lore  that  were  in \\nthe  house  of  Elrond.  Sometimes  Frodo  was  with  them;  but \\nhe  was  content  to  lean  on  their  guidance,  and  he  spent  as \\nmuch  time  as  he  could  with  Bilbo. \\n\\nIn  those  last  days  the  hobbits  sat  together  in  the  evening  in \\nthe  Hall  of  Fire,  and  there  among  many  tales  they  heard  told \\nin  full  the  lay  of  Beren  and  Luthien  and  the  winning  of  the \\nGreat  Jewel;  but  in  the  day,  while  Merry  and  Pippin  were \\nout  and  about,  Frodo  and  Sam  were  to  be  found  with  Bilbo \\nin  his  own  small  room.  Then  Bilbo  would  read  passages  from \\nhis  book  (which  still  seemed  very  incomplete),  or  scraps  of \\nhis  verses,  or  would  take  notes  of  Frodo’s  adventures. \\n\\nOn  the  morning  of  the  last  day  Frodo  was  alone  with  Bilbo, \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH  361 \\n\\nand  the  old  hobbit  pulled  out  from  under  his  bed  a  wooden \\nbox.  He  lifted  the  lid  and  fumbled  inside. \\n\\n‘Here  is  your  sword,’  he  said.  ‘But  it  was  broken,  you  know. \\nI  took  it  to  keep  it  safe  but  I’ve  forgotten  to  ask  if  the  smiths \\ncould  mend  it.  No  time  now.  So  I  thought,  perhaps,  you \\nwould  care  to  have  this,  don’t  you  know?’ \\n\\nHe  took  from  the  box  a  small  sword  in  an  old  shabby \\nleathern  scabbard.  Then  he  drew  it,  and  its  polished  and \\nwell-tended  blade  glittered  suddenly,  cold  and  bright.  ‘This \\nis  Sting,’  he  said,  and  thrust  it  with  little  effort  deep  into \\na  wooden  beam.  ‘Take  it,  if  you  like.  I  shan’t  want  it  again, \\nI  expect.’ \\n\\nFrodo  accepted  it  gratefully. \\n\\n‘Also  there  is  this!’  said  Bilbo,  bringing  out  a  parcel  which \\nseemed  to  be  rather  heavy  for  its  size.  He  unwound  several \\nfolds  of  old  cloth,  and  held  up  a  small  shirt  of  mail.  It  was \\nclose-woven  of  many  rings,  as  supple  almost  as  linen,  cold  as \\nice,  and  harder  than  steel.  It  shone  like  moonlit  silver,  and \\nwas  studded  with  white  gems.  With  it  was  a  belt  of  pearl  and \\ncrystal. \\n\\n‘It’s  a  pretty  thing,  isn’t  it?’  said  Bilbo,  moving  it  in  the \\nlight.  ‘And  useful.  It  is  my  dwarf-mail  that  Thorin  gave  me. \\nI  got  it  back  from  Michel  Delving  before  I  started,  and  packed \\nit  with  my  luggage.  I  brought  all  the  mementoes  of  my  Jour¬ \\nney  away  with  me,  except  the  Ring.  But  I  did  not  expect  to \\nuse  this,  and  I  don’t  need  it  now,  except  to  look  at  sometimes. \\nYou  hardly  feel  any  weight  when  you  put  it  on.’ \\n\\n‘I  should  look  -  well,  I  don’t  think  I  should  look  right  in  it,’ \\nsaid  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Just  what  I  said  myself,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘But  never  mind  about \\nlooks.  You  can  wear  it  under  your  outer  clothes.  Come  on! \\nYou  must  share  this  secret  with  me.  Don’t  tell  anybody  else! \\nBut  I  should  feel  happier  if  I  knew  you  were  wearing  it.  I \\nhave  a  fancy  it  would  turn  even  the  knives  of  the  Black \\nRiders,’  he  ended  in  a  low  voice. \\n\\n‘Very  well,  I  will  take  it,’  said  Frodo.  Bilbo  put  it  on  him, \\nand  fastened  Sting  upon  the  glittering  belt;  and  then  Frodo \\n\\n\\n362 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nput  over  the  top  his  old  weather-stained  breeches,  tunic,  and \\njacket. \\n\\n‘Just  a  plain  hobbit  you  look,’  said  Bilbo.  ‘But  there  is  more \\nabout  you  now  than  appears  on  the  surface.  Good  luck  to \\nyou!’  He  turned  away  and  looked  out  of  the  window,  trying \\nto  hum  a  tune. \\n\\n‘I  cannot  thank  you  as  I  should,  Bilbo,  for  this,  and  for  all \\nyour  past  kindnesses,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Don’t  try!’  said  the  old  hobbit,  turning  round  and  slapping \\nhim  on  the  back.  ‘Ow!’  he  cried.  ‘You  are  too  hard  now  to \\nslap!  But  there  you  are:  Hobbits  must  stick  together,  and \\nespecially  Bagginses.  All  I  ask  in  return  is:  take  as  much  care \\nof  yourself  as  you  can,  and  bring  back  all  the  news  you  can, \\nand  any  old  songs  and  tales  you  can  come  by.  I’ll  do  my  best \\nto  finish  my  book  before  you  return.  I  should  like  to  write  the \\nsecond  book,  if  I  am  spared.’  He  broke  off  and  turned  to  the \\nwindow  again,  singing  softly. \\n\\nI  sit  beside  the  fire  and  think \\nof  all  that  I  have  seen, \\nof  meadow-flowers  and  butterflies \\nin  summers  that  have  been; \\n\\nOf  yellow  leaves  and  gossamer \\nin  autumns  that  there  were, \\nwith  morning  mist  and  silver  sun \\nand  wind  upon  my  hair. \\n\\nI  sit  beside  the  fire  and  think \\nof  how  the  world  will  be \\nwhen  winter  comes  without  a  spring \\nthat  I  shall  ever  see. \\n\\nFor  still  there  are  so  many  things \\nthat  I  have  never  seen: \\nin  every  wood  in  every  spring \\nthere  is  a  different  green. \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n363 \\n\\n\\nI  sit  beside  the  fire  and  think \\nof  people  long  ago, \\nand  people  who  will  see  a  world \\nthat  I  shall  never  know. \\n\\nBut  all  the  while  I  sit  and  think \\nof  times  there  were  before, \\n\\nI  listen  for  returning  feet \\nand  voices  at  the  door. \\n\\nIt  was  a  cold  grey  day  near  the  end  of  December.  The  East \\nWind  was  streaming  through  the  bare  branches  of  the  trees, \\nand  seething  in  the  dark  pines  on  the  hills.  Ragged  clouds \\nwere  hurrying  overhead,  dark  and  low.  As  the  cheerless \\nshadows  of  the  early  evening  began  to  fall  the  Company \\nmade  ready  to  set  out.  They  were  to  start  at  dusk,  for  Elrond \\ncounselled  them  to  journey  under  cover  of  night  as  often  as \\nthey  could,  until  they  were  far  from  Rivendell. \\n\\n‘You  should  fear  the  many  eyes  of  the  servants  of  Sauron,’ \\nhe  said.  ‘I  do  not  doubt  that  news  of  the  discomfiture  of  the \\nRiders  has  already  reached  him,  and  he  will  be  filled  with \\nwrath.  Soon  now  his  spies  on  foot  and  wing  will  be  abroad \\nin  the  northern  lands.  Even  of  the  sky  above  you  must  beware \\nas  you  go  on  your  way.’ \\n\\nThe  Company  took  little  gear  of  war,  for  their  hope  was \\nin  secrecy  not  in  battle.  Aragorn  had  Anduril  but  no  other \\nweapon,  and  he  went  forth  clad  only  in  rusty  green  and \\nbrown,  as  a  Ranger  of  the  wilderness.  Boromir  had  a  long \\nsword,  in  fashion  like  Anduril  but  of  less  lineage,  and  he  bore \\nalso  a  shield  and  his  war-horn. \\n\\n‘Loud  and  clear  it  sounds  in  the  valleys  of  the  hills,’  he \\nsaid,  ‘and  then  let  all  the  foes  of  Gondor  flee!’  Putting  it  to \\nhis  lips  he  blew  a  blast,  and  the  echoes  leapt  from  rock  to \\nrock,  and  all  that  heard  that  voice  in  Rivendell  sprang  to  their \\nfeet. \\n\\n‘Slow  should  you  be  to  wind  that  horn  again,  Boromir,’ \\n\\n\\n364  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nsaid  Elrond,  ‘until  you  stand  once  more  on  the  borders  of \\nyour  land,  and  dire  need  is  on  you.’ \\n\\n‘Maybe,’  said  Boromir.  ‘But  always  I  have  let  my  horn  cry \\nat  setting  forth,  and  though  thereafter  we  may  walk  in  the \\nshadows,  I  will  not  go  forth  as  a  thief  in  the  night.’ \\n\\nGimli  the  dwarf  alone  wore  openly  a  short  shirt  of  steel- \\nrings,  for  dwarves  make  light  of  burdens;  and  in  his  belt  was \\na  broad-bladed  axe.  Legolas  had  a  bow  and  a  quiver,  and  at \\nhis  belt  a  long  white  knife.  The  younger  hobbits  wore  the \\nswords  that  they  had  taken  from  the  barrow;  but  Frodo  took \\nonly  Sting;  and  his  mail-coat,  as  Bilbo  wished,  remained \\nhidden.  Gandalf  bore  his  staff,  but  girt  at  his  side  was  the \\nelven-sword  Glamdring,  the  mate  of  Orcrist  that  lay  now \\nupon  the  breast  of  Thorin  under  the  Lonely  Mountain. \\n\\nAll  were  well  furnished  by  Elrond  with  thick  warm  clothes, \\nand  they  had  jackets  and  cloaks  lined  with  fur.  Spare  food \\nand  clothes  and  blankets  and  other  needs  were  laden  on  a \\npony,  none  other  than  the  poor  beast  that  they  had  brought \\nfrom  Bree. \\n\\nThe  stay  in  Rivendell  had  worked  a  great  wonder  of  change \\non  him:  he  was  glossy  and  seemed  to  have  the  vigour  of  youth. \\nIt  was  Sam  who  had  insisted  on  choosing  him,  declaring  that \\nBill  (as  he  called  him)  would  pine,  if  he  did  not  come. \\n\\n‘That  animal  can  nearly  talk,’  he  said,  ‘and  would  talk,  if \\nhe  stayed  here  much  longer.  He  gave  me  a  look  as  plain  as \\nMr.  Pippin  could  speak  it:  if  you  don’t  let  me  go  with  you, \\nSam,  I’ll  follow  on  my  own.’  So  Bill  was  going  as  the  beast \\nof  burden,  yet  he  was  the  only  member  of  the  Company  that \\ndid  not  seem  depressed. \\n\\nTheir  farewells  had  been  said  in  the  great  hall  by  the  fire, \\nand  they  were  only  waiting  now  for  Gandalf,  who  had  not \\nyet  come  out  of  the  house.  A  gleam  of  firelight  came  from \\nthe  open  doors,  and  soft  lights  were  glowing  in  many \\nwindows.  Bilbo  huddled  in  a  cloak  stood  silent  on  the  door¬ \\nstep  beside  Frodo.  Aragorn  sat  with  his  head  bowed  to  his \\nknees;  only  Elrond  knew  fully  what  this  hour  meant  to  him. \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n365 \\n\\n\\nThe  others  could  be  seen  as  grey  shapes  in  the  darkness. \\n\\nSam  was  standing  by  the  pony,  sucking  his  teeth,  and \\nstaring  moodily  into  the  gloom  where  the  river  roared  stonily \\nbelow;  his  desire  for  adventure  was  at  its  lowest  ebb. \\n\\n‘Bill,  my  lad,’  he  said,  ‘you  oughtn’t  to  have  took  up  with \\nus.  You  could  have  stayed  here  and  et  the  best  hay  till  the \\nnew  grass  comes.’  Bill  swished  his  tail  and  said  nothing. \\n\\nSam  eased  the  pack  on  his  shoulders,  and  went  over \\nanxiously  in  his  mind  all  the  things  that  he  had  stowed \\nin  it,  wondering  if  he  had  forgotten  anything:  his  chief \\ntreasure,  his  cooking  gear;  and  the  little  box  of  salt  that \\nhe  always  carried  and  refilled  when  he  could;  a  good  supply \\nof  pipe-weed  (but  not  near  enough,  I’ll  warrant);  flint \\nand  tinder;  woollen  hose;  linen;  various  small  belongings  of \\nhis  master’s  that  Frodo  had  forgotten  and  Sam  had  stowed \\nto  bring  them  out  in  triumph  when  they  were  called  for.  He \\nwent  through  them  all. \\n\\n‘Rope!’  he  muttered.  ‘No  rope!  And  only  last  night  you \\nsaid  to  yourself:  “Sam,  what  about  a  bit  of  rope?  You’ll  want \\nit,  if  you  haven’t  got  it.”  Well,  I’ll  want  it.  I  can’t  get  it  now.’ \\n\\nAt  that  moment  Elrond  came  out  with  Gandalf,  and  he \\ncalled  the  Company  to  him.  ‘This  is  my  last  word,’  he  said \\nin  a  low  voice.  ‘The  Ring-bearer  is  setting  out  on  the  Quest \\nof  Mount  Doom.  On  him  alone  is  any  charge  laid:  neither  to \\ncast  away  the  Ring,  nor  to  deliver  it  to  any  servant  of  the \\nEnemy  nor  indeed  to  let  any  handle  it,  save  members  of  the \\nCompany  and  the  Council,  and  only  then  in  gravest  need. \\nThe  others  go  with  him  as  free  companions,  to  help  him  on \\nhis  way.  You  may  tarry,  or  come  back,  or  turn  aside  into \\nother  paths,  as  chance  allows.  The  further  you  go,  the  less \\neasy  will  it  be  to  withdraw;  yet  no  oath  or  bond  is  laid  on  you \\nto  go  further  than  you  will.  For  you  do  not  yet  know  the \\nstrength  of  your  hearts,  and  you  cannot  foresee  what  each \\nmay  meet  upon  the  road.’ \\n\\n‘Faithless  is  he  that  says  farewell  when  the  road  darkens,’ \\nsaid  Gimli. \\n\\n\\n366 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Maybe,’  said  Elrond,  ‘but  let  him  not  vow  to  walk  in  the \\ndark,  who  has  not  seen  the  nightfall.’ \\n\\n‘Yet  sworn  word  may  strengthen  quaking  heart,’  said \\nGimli. \\n\\n‘Or  break  it,’  said  Elrond.  ‘Look  not  too  far  ahead!  But  go \\nnow  with  good  hearts!  Farewell,  and  may  the  blessing  of  Elves \\nand  Men  and  all  Free  Folk  go  with  you.  May  the  stars  shine \\nupon  your  faces!’ \\n\\n‘Good  ...  good  luck!’  cried  Bilbo,  stuttering  with  the  cold. \\n‘I  don’t  suppose  you  will  be  able  to  keep  a  diary,  Frodo  my \\nlad,  but  I  shall  expect  a  full  account  when  you  get  back.  And \\ndon’t  be  too  long!  Farewell!’ \\n\\nMany  others  of  Elrond’s  household  stood  in  the  shadows \\nand  watched  them  go,  bidding  them  farewell  with  soft  voices. \\nThere  was  no  laughter,  and  no  song  or  music.  At  last  they \\nturned  away  and  faded  silently  into  the  dusk. \\n\\nThey  crossed  the  bridge  and  wound  slowly  up  the  long \\nsteep  paths  that  led  out  of  the  cloven  vale  of  Rivendell;  and \\nthey  came  at  length  to  the  high  moor  where  the  wind  hissed \\nthrough  the  heather.  Then  with  one  glance  at  the  Last \\nHomely  House  twinkling  below  them  they  strode  away  far \\ninto  the  night. \\n\\nAt  the  Ford  of  Bruinen  they  left  the  Road  and  turning \\nsouthwards  went  on  by  narrow  paths  among  the  folded  lands. \\nTheir  purpose  was  to  hold  this  course  west  of  the  Mountains \\nfor  many  miles  and  days.  The  country  was  much  rougher \\nand  more  barren  than  in  the  green  vale  of  the  Great  River  in \\nWilderland  on  the  other  side  of  the  range,  and  their  going \\nwould  be  slow;  but  they  hoped  in  this  way  to  escape  the \\nnotice  of  unfriendly  eyes.  The  spies  of  Sauron  had  hitherto \\nseldom  been  seen  in  this  empty  country,  and  the  paths  were \\nlittle  known  except  to  the  people  of  Rivendell. \\n\\nGandalf  walked  in  front,  and  with  him  went  Aragorn,  who \\nknew  this  land  even  in  the  dark.  The  others  were  in  file \\nbehind,  and  Legolas  whose  eyes  were  keen  was  the  rearguard. \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n367 \\n\\n\\nThe  first  part  of  their  journey  was  hard  and  dreary,  and  Frodo \\nremembered  little  of  it,  save  the  wind.  For  many  sunless \\ndays  an  icy  blast  came  from  the  Mountains  in  the  east,  and \\nno  garment  seemed  able  to  keep  out  its  searching  fingers. \\nThough  the  Company  was  well  clad,  they  seldom  felt  warm, \\neither  moving  or  at  rest.  They  slept  uneasily  during  the \\nmiddle  of  the  day,  in  some  hollow  of  the  land,  or  hidden \\nunder  the  tangled  thorn-bushes  that  grew  in  thickets  in  many \\nplaces.  In  the  late  afternoon  they  were  roused  by  the  watch, \\nand  took  their  chief  meal:  cold  and  cheerless  as  a  rule,  for \\nthey  could  seldom  risk  the  lighting  of  a  fire.  In  the  evening \\nthey  went  on  again,  always  as  nearly  southward  as  they  could \\nfind  a  way. \\n\\nAt  first  it  seemed  to  the  hobbits  that  although  they  walked \\nand  stumbled  until  they  were  weary,  they  were  creeping  for¬ \\nward  like  snails,  and  getting  nowhere.  Each  day  the  land \\nlooked  much  the  same  as  it  had  the  day  before.  Yet  steadily \\nthe  mountains  were  drawing  nearer.  South  of  Rivendell  they \\nrose  ever  higher,  and  bent  westwards;  and  about  the  feet  of \\nthe  main  range  there  was  tumbled  an  ever  wider  land  of  bleak \\nhills,  and  deep  valleys  filled  with  turbulent  waters.  Paths  were \\nfew  and  winding,  and  led  them  often  only  to  the  edge  of \\nsome  sheer  fall,  or  down  into  treacherous  swamps. \\n\\nThey  had  been  a  fortnight  on  the  way  when  the  weather \\nchanged.  The  wind  suddenly  fell  and  then  veered  round  to \\nthe  south.  The  swift-flowing  clouds  lifted  and  melted  away, \\nand  the  sun  came  out,  pale  and  bright.  There  came  a  cold \\nclear  dawn  at  the  end  of  a  long  stumbling  night-march.  The \\ntravellers  reached  a  low  ridge  crowned  with  ancient  holly- \\ntrees  whose  grey-green  trunks  seemed  to  have  been  built  out \\nof  the  very  stone  of  the  hills.  Their  dark  leaves  shone  and \\ntheir  berries  glowed  red  in  the  light  of  the  rising  sun. \\n\\nAway  in  the  south  Frodo  could  see  the  dim  shapes  of  lofty \\nmountains  that  seemed  now  to  stand  across  the  path  that  the \\nCompany  was  taking.  At  the  left  of  this  high  range  rose  three \\npeaks;  the  tallest  and  nearest  stood  up  like  a  tooth  tipped  with \\n\\n\\n368 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nsnow;  its  great,  bare,  northern  precipice  was  still  largely  in \\nthe  shadow,  but  where  the  sunlight  slanted  upon  it,  it  glowed \\nred. \\n\\nGandalf  stood  at  Frodo’s  side  and  looked  out  under  his \\nhand.  ‘We  have  done  well,’  he  said.  We  have  reached  the \\nborders  of  the  country  that  Men  call  Flollin;  many  Elves  lived \\nhere  in  happier  days,  when  Eregion  was  its  name.  Five-and- \\nforty  leagues  as  the  crow  flies  we  have  come,  though  many \\nlong  miles  further  our  feet  have  walked.  The  land  and  the \\nweather  will  be  milder  now,  but  perhaps  all  the  more \\ndangerous.’ \\n\\n‘Dangerous  or  not,  a  real  sunrise  is  mighty  welcome,’  said \\nFrodo,  throwing  back  his  hood  and  letting  the  morning  light \\nfall  on  his  face. \\n\\n‘But  the  mountains  are  ahead  of  us,’  said  Pippin.  We  must \\nhave  turned  eastwards  in  the  night.’ \\n\\n‘No,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘But  you  see  further  ahead  in  the  clear \\nlight.  Beyond  those  peaks  the  range  bends  round  south-west. \\nThere  are  many  maps  in  Elrond’s  house,  but  I  suppose  you \\nnever  thought  to  look  at  them?’ \\n\\n‘Yes  I  did,  sometimes,’  said  Pippin,  ‘but  I  don’t  remember \\nthem.  Frodo  has  a  better  head  for  that  sort  of  thing.’ \\n\\n‘I  need  no  map,’  said  Gimli,  who  had  come  up  with \\nLegolas,  and  was  gazing  out  before  him  with  a  strange  light \\nin  his  deep  eyes.  ‘There  is  the  land  where  our  fathers  worked \\nof  old,  and  we  have  wrought  the  image  of  those  mountains \\ninto  many  works  of  metal  and  of  stone,  and  into  many \\nsongs  and  tales.  They  stand  tall  in  our  dreams:  Baraz,  Zirak, \\nShathur. \\n\\n‘Only  once  before  have  I  seen  them  from  afar  in  waking \\nlife,  but  I  know  them  and  their  names,  for  under  them  lies \\nKhazad-dum,  the  Dwarrowdelf,  that  is  now  called  the  Black \\nPit,  Moria  in  the  Elvish  tongue.  Yonder  stands  Barazinbar, \\nthe  Redhorn,  cruel  Caradhras;  and  beyond  him  are  Silvertine \\nand  Cloudyhead:  Celebdil  the  White,  and  Fanuidhol  the \\nGrey,  that  we  call  Zirakzigil  and  Bundushathur. \\n\\n‘There  the  Misty  Mountains  divide,  and  between  their \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n369 \\n\\n\\narms  lies  the  deep-shadowed  valley  which  we  cannot  for¬ \\nget:  Azanulbizar,  the  Dimrill  Dale,  which  the  Elves  call \\nNanduhirion.’ \\n\\n‘It  is  for  the  Dimrill  Dale  that  we  are  making,’  said  Gandalf. \\n‘If  we  climb  the  pass  that  is  called  the  Redhorn  Gate,  under \\nthe  far  side  of  Caradhras,  we  shall  come  down  by  the  Dimrill \\nStair  into  the  deep  vale  of  the  Dwarves.  There  lies  the \\nMirrormere,  and  there  the  River  Silverlode  rises  in  its  icy \\nsprings.’ \\n\\n‘Dark  is  the  water  of  Kheled-zaram,’  said  Gimli,  ‘and  cold \\nare  the  springs  of  Kibil-nala.  My  heart  trembles  at  the  thought \\nthat  I  may  see  them  soon.’ \\n\\n‘May  you  have  joy  of  the  sight,  my  good  dwarf!’  said \\nGandalf.  ‘But  whatever  you  may  do,  we  at  least  cannot  stay \\nin  that  valley.  We  must  go  down  the  Silverlode  into  the  secret \\nwoods,  and  so  to  the  Great  River,  and  then - ’ \\n\\nHe  paused. \\n\\n‘Yes,  and  where  then?’  asked  Merry. \\n\\n‘To  the  end  of  the  journey  -  in  the  end,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘We \\ncannot  look  too  far  ahead.  Let  us  be  glad  that  the  first  stage \\nis  safely  over.  I  think  we  will  rest  here,  not  only  today  but \\ntonight  as  well.  There  is  a  wholesome  air  about  Hollin.  Much \\nevil  must  befall  a  country  before  it  wholly  forgets  the  Elves, \\nif  once  they  dwelt  there.’ \\n\\n‘That  is  true,’  said  Legolas.  ‘But  the  Elves  of  this  land  were \\nof  a  race  strange  to  us  of  the  silvan  folic,  and  the  trees  and \\nthe  grass  do  not  now  remember  them.  Only  I  hear  the  stones \\nlament  them:  deep  they  delved  us,  fair  they  wrought  us,  high \\nthey  builded  us;  but  they  are  gone.  They  are  gone.  They  sought \\nthe  Havens  long  ago.’ \\n\\nThat  morning  they  lit  a  fire  in  a  deep  hollow  shrouded  by \\ngreat  bushes  of  holly,  and  their  supper-breakfast  was  merrier \\nthan  it  had  been  since  they  set  out.  They  did  not  hurry  to \\nbed  afterwards,  for  they  expected  to  have  all  the  night  to \\nsleep  in,  and  they  did  not  mean  to  go  on  again  until  the \\nevening  of  the  next  day.  Only  Aragorn  was  silent  and  restless. \\n\\n\\n370  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nAfter  a  while  he  left  the  Company  and  wandered  on  to  the \\nridge;  there  he  stood  in  the  shadow  of  a  tree,  looking  out \\nsouthwards  and  westwards,  with  his  head  posed  as  if  he  was \\nlistening.  Then  he  returned  to  the  brink  of  the  dell  and  looked \\ndown  at  the  others  laughing  and  talking. \\n\\n‘What  is  the  matter,  Strider?’  Merry  called  up.  What  are \\nyou  looking  for?  Do  you  miss  the  East  Wind?’ \\n\\n‘No  indeed,’  he  answered.  ‘But  I  miss  something.  I  have \\nbeen  in  the  country  of  Hollin  in  many  seasons.  No  folk  dwell \\nhere  now,  but  many  other  creatures  live  here  at  all  times, \\nespecially  birds.  Yet  now  all  things  but  you  are  silent.  I  can \\nfeel  it.  There  is  no  sound  for  miles  about  us,  and  your  voices \\nseem  to  make  the  ground  echo.  I  do  not  understand  it.’ \\n\\nGandalf  looked  up  with  sudden  interest.  ‘But  what  do  you \\nguess  is  the  reason?’  he  asked.  ‘Is  there  more  in  it  than  sur¬ \\nprise  at  seeing  four  hobbits,  not  to  mention  the  rest  of  us, \\nwhere  people  are  so  seldom  seen  or  heard?’ \\n\\n‘I  hope  that  is  it,’  answered  Aragorn.  ‘But  I  have  a  sense  of \\nwatchfulness,  and  of  fear,  that  I  have  never  had  here  before.’ \\n\\n‘Then  we  must  be  more  careful,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘If  you \\nbring  a  Ranger  with  you,  it  is  well  to  pay  attention  to  him, \\nespecially  if  the  Ranger  is  Aragorn.  We  must  stop  talking \\naloud,  rest  quietly,  and  set  the  watch.’ \\n\\nIt  was  Sam’s  turn  that  day  to  take  the  first  watch,  but \\nAragorn  joined  him.  The  others  fell  asleep.  Then  the  silence \\ngrew  until  even  Sam  felt  it.  The  breathing  of  the  sleepers \\ncould  be  plainly  heard.  The  swish  of  the  pony’s  tail  and  the \\noccasional  movements  of  his  feet  became  loud  noises.  Sam \\ncould  hear  his  own  joints  creaking,  if  he  stirred.  Dead  silence \\nwas  around  him,  and  over  all  hung  a  clear  blue  sky,  as  the \\nSun  rode  up  from  the  East.  Away  in  the  South  a  dark  patch \\nappeared,  and  grew,  and  drove  north  like  flying  smoke  in  the \\nwind. \\n\\n‘What’s  that,  Strider?  It  don’t  look  like  a  cloud,’  said  Sam \\nin  a  whisper  to  Aragorn.  He  made  no  answer,  he  was  gazing \\nintently  at  the  sky;  but  before  long  Sam  could  see  for  himself \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n371 \\n\\n\\nwhat  was  approaching.  Flocks  of  birds,  flying  at  great  speed, \\nwere  wheeling  and  circling,  and  traversing  all  the  land  as  if \\nthey  were  searching  for  something;  and  they  were  steadily \\ndrawing  nearer. \\n\\n‘Lie  flat  and  still!’  hissed  Aragorn,  pulling  Sam  down  into \\nthe  shade  of  a  holly-bush;  for  a  whole  regiment  of  birds  had \\nbroken  away  suddenly  from  the  main  host,  and  came,  flying \\nlow,  straight  towards  the  ridge.  Sam  thought  they  were  a  kind \\nof  crow  of  large  size.  As  they  passed  overhead,  in  so  dense  a \\nthrong  that  their  shadow  followed  them  darkly  over  the \\nground  below,  one  harsh  croak  was  heard. \\n\\nNot  until  they  had  dwindled  into  the  distance,  north  and \\nwest,  and  the  sky  was  again  clear  would  Aragorn  rise.  Then \\nhe  sprang  up  and  went  and  wakened  Gandalf. \\n\\n‘Regiments  of  black  crows  are  flying  over  all  the  land \\nbetween  the  Mountains  and  the  Greyflood,’  he  said,  ‘and \\nthey  have  passed  over  Hollin.  They  are  not  natives  here;  they \\nare  crebain  out  of  Fangorn  and  Dunland.  I  do  not  know  what \\nthey  are  about:  possibly  there  is  some  trouble  away  south \\nfrom  which  they  are  fleeing;  but  I  think  they  are  spying  out \\nthe  land.  I  have  also  glimpsed  many  hawks  flying  high  up  in \\nthe  sky.  I  think  we  ought  to  move  again  this  evening.  Hollin \\nis  no  longer  wholesome  for  us:  it  is  being  watched.’ \\n\\n‘And  in  that  case  so  is  the  Redhorn  Gate,’  said  Gandalf; \\n‘and  how  we  can  get  over  that  without  being  seen,  I  cannot \\nimagine.  But  we  will  think  of  that  when  we  must.  As  for \\nmoving  as  soon  as  it  is  dark,  I  am  afraid  that  you  are  right.’ \\n\\n‘Luckily  our  fire  made  little  smoke,  and  had  burned  low \\nbefore  the  crebain  came,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘It  must  be  put  out \\nand  not  lit  again.’ \\n\\n‘Well  if  that  isn’t  a  plague  and  a  nuisance!’  said  Pippin. \\nThe  news:  no  fire,  and  a  move  again  by  night,  had  been \\nbroken  to  him,  as  soon  as  he  woke  in  the  late  afternoon.  ‘All \\nbecause  of  a  pack  of  crows!  I  had  looked  forward  to  a  real \\ngood  meal  tonight:  something  hot.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  you  can  go  on  looking  forward,’  said  Gandalf. \\n\\n\\n372 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘There  may  be  many  unexpected  feasts  ahead  for  you.  For \\nmyself  I  should  like  a  pipe  to  smoke  in  comfort,  and  warmer \\nfeet.  However,  we  are  certain  of  one  thing  at  any  rate:  it  will \\nget  warmer  as  we  get  south.’ \\n\\n‘Too  warm,  I  shouldn’t  wonder,’  muttered  Sam  to  Frodo. \\n‘But  I’m  beginning  to  think  it’s  time  we  got  a  sight  of  that \\nFiery  Mountain,  and  saw  the  end  of  the  Road,  so  to  speak.  I \\nthought  at  first  that  this  here  Redhorn,  or  whatever  its  name \\nis,  might  be  it,  till  Gimli  spoke  his  piece.  A  fair  jaw-cracker \\ndwarf-language  must  be!’  Maps  conveyed  nothing  to  Sam’s \\nmind,  and  all  distances  in  these  strange  lands  seemed  so  vast \\nthat  he  was  quite  out  of  his  reckoning. \\n\\nAll  that  day  the  Company  remained  in  hiding.  The  dark \\nbirds  passed  over  now  and  again;  but  as  the  westering  Sun \\ngrew  red  they  disappeared  southwards.  At  dusk  the  Company \\nset  out,  and  turning  now  half  east  they  steered  their  course \\ntowards  Caradhras,  which  far  away  still  glowed  faintly  red  in \\nthe  last  light  of  the  vanished  Sun.  One  by  one  white  stars \\nsprang  forth  as  the  sky  faded. \\n\\nGuided  by  Aragorn  they  struck  a  good  path.  It  looked  to \\nFrodo  like  the  remains  of  an  ancient  road,  that  had  once  been \\nbroad  and  well  planned,  from  Hollin  to  the  mountain-pass. \\nThe  Moon,  now  at  the  full,  rose  over  the  mountains,  and  cast \\na  pale  light  in  which  the  shadows  of  stones  were  black.  Many \\nof  them  looked  to  have  been  worked  by  hands,  though  now \\nthey  lay  tumbled  and  ruinous  in  a  bleak,  barren  land. \\n\\nIt  was  the  cold  chill  hour  before  the  first  stir  of  dawn,  and \\nthe  moon  was  low.  Frodo  looked  up  at  the  sky.  Suddenly \\nhe  saw  or  felt  a  shadow  pass  over  the  high  stars,  as  if  for  a \\nmoment  they  faded  and  then  flashed  out  again.  He  shivered. \\n\\n‘Did  you  see  anything  pass  over?’  he  whispered  to  Gandalf, \\nwho  was  just  ahead. \\n\\n‘No,  but  I  felt  it,  whatever  it  was,’  he  answered.  ‘It  may  be \\nnothing,  only  a  wisp  of  thin  cloud.’ \\n\\n‘It  was  moving  fast  then,’  muttered  Aragorn,  ‘and  not  with \\nthe  wind.’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n373 \\n\\n\\nNothing  further  happened  that  night.  The  next  morning \\ndawned  even  brighter  than  before.  But  the  air  was  chill  again; \\nalready  the  wind  was  turning  back  towards  the  east.  For  two \\nmore  nights  they  marched  on,  climbing  steadily  but  ever \\nmore  slowly  as  their  road  wound  up  into  the  hills,  and  the \\nmountains  towered  up,  nearer  and  nearer.  On  the  third  morn¬ \\ning  Caradhras  rose  before  them,  a  mighty  peak,  tipped  with \\nsnow  like  silver,  but  with  sheer  naked  sides,  dull  red  as  if \\nstained  with  blood. \\n\\nThere  was  a  black  look  in  the  sky,  and  the  sun  was  wan. \\nThe  wind  had  gone  now  round  to  the  north-east.  Gandalf \\nsnuffed  the  air  and  looked  back. \\n\\n‘Winter  deepens  behind  us,’  he  said  quietly  to  Aragorn. \\n‘The  heights  away  north  are  whiter  than  they  were;  snow  is \\nlying  far  down  their  shoulders.  Tonight  we  shall  be  on  our \\nway  high  up  towards  the  Redhorn  Gate.  We  may  well  be \\nseen  by  watchers  on  that  narrow  path,  and  waylaid  by  some \\nevil;  but  the  weather  may  prove  a  more  deadly  enemy  than \\nany.  What  do  you  think  of  your  course  now,  Aragorn?’ \\n\\nFrodo  overheard  these  words,  and  understood  that \\nGandalf  and  Aragorn  were  continuing  some  debate  that  had \\nbegun  long  before.  He  listened  anxiously. \\n\\n‘I  think  no  good  of  our  course  from  beginning  to  end, \\nas  you  know  well,  Gandalf,’  answered  Aragorn.  ‘And  perils \\nknown  and  unknown  will  grow  as  we  go  on.  But  we  must  go \\non;  and  it  is  no  good  our  delaying  the  passage  of  the  moun¬ \\ntains.  Further  south  there  are  no  passes,  till  one  comes  to  the \\nGap  of  Rohan.  I  do  not  trust  that  way  since  your  news  of \\nSaruman.  Who  knows  which  side  now  the  marshals  of  the \\nHorse-lords  serve?’ \\n\\nWho  knows  indeed!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘But  there  is  another \\nway,  and  not  by  the  pass  of  Caradhras:  the  dark  and  secret \\nway  that  we  have  spoken  of.’ \\n\\n‘But  let  us  not  speak  of  it  again!  Not  yet.  Say  nothing  to \\nthe  others,  I  beg,  not  until  it  is  plain  that  there  is  no  other \\nway.’ \\n\\n‘We  must  decide  before  we  go  further,’  answered  Gandalf. \\n\\n\\n374 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Then  let  us  weigh  the  matter  in  our  minds,  while  the \\nothers  rest  and  sleep,’  said  Aragorn. \\n\\nIn  the  late  afternoon,  while  the  others  were  finishing  their \\nbreakfast,  Gandalf  and  Aragorn  went  aside  together  and \\nstood  looking  at  Caradhras.  Its  sides  were  now  dark  and \\nsullen,  and  its  head  was  in  grey  cloud.  Frodo  watched  them, \\nwondering  which  way  the  debate  would  go.  When  they \\nreturned  to  the  Company  Gandalf  spoke,  and  then  he  knew \\nthat  it  had  been  decided  to  face  the  weather  and  the  high \\npass.  He  was  relieved.  He  could  not  guess  what  was  the  other \\ndark  and  secret  way,  but  the  very  mention  of  it  had  seemed \\nto  fill  Aragorn  with  dismay,  and  Frodo  was  glad  that  it  had \\nbeen  abandoned. \\n\\n‘From  signs  that  we  have  seen  lately,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘I  fear \\nthat  the  Redhorn  Gate  may  be  watched;  and  also  I  have \\ndoubts  of  the  weather  that  is  coming  up  behind.  Snow  may \\ncome.  We  must  go  with  all  the  speed  that  we  can.  Even  so  it \\nwill  take  us  more  than  two  marches  before  we  reach  the  top \\nof  the  pass.  Dark  will  come  early  this  evening.  We  must  leave \\nas  soon  as  you  can  get  ready.’ \\n\\n‘I  will  add  a  word  of  advice,  if  I  may,’  said  Boromir.  ‘I  was \\nborn  under  the  shadow  of  the  White  Mountains  and  know \\nsomething  of  journeys  in  the  high  places.  We  shall  meet  bitter \\ncold,  if  no  worse,  before  we  come  down  on  the  other  side.  It \\nwill  not  help  us  to  keep  so  secret  that  we  are  frozen  to  death. \\nWhen  we  leave  here,  where  there  are  still  a  few  trees  and \\nbushes,  each  of  us  should  carry  a  faggot  of  wood,  as  large  as \\nhe  can  bear.’ \\n\\n‘And  Bill  could  take  a  bit  more,  couldn’t  you,  lad?’  said \\nSam.  The  pony  looked  at  him  mournfully. \\n\\n‘Very  well,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘But  we  must  not  use  the  wood \\n-  not  unless  it  is  a  choice  between  fire  and  death.’ \\n\\nThe  Company  set  out  again,  with  good  speed  at  first;  but \\nsoon  their  way  became  steep  and  difficult.  The  twisting \\nand  climbing  road  had  in  many  places  almost  disappeared, \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n375 \\n\\n\\nand  was  blocked  with  many  fallen  stones.  The  night  grew \\ndeadly  dark  under  great  clouds.  A  bitter  wind  swirled  among \\nthe  rocks.  By  midnight  they  had  climbed  to  the  knees  of  the \\ngreat  mountains.  The  narrow  path  now  wound  under  a  sheer \\nwall  of  cliffs  to  the  left,  above  which  the  grim  flanks  of \\nCaradhras  towered  up  invisible  in  the  gloom;  on  the  right \\nwas  a  gulf  of  darkness  where  the  land  fell  suddenly  into  a \\ndeep  ravine. \\n\\nLaboriously  they  climbed  a  sharp  slope  and  halted  for  a \\nmoment  at  the  top.  Frodo  felt  a  soft  touch  on  his  face.  He \\nput  out  his  arm  and  saw  the  dim  white  flakes  of  snow  settling \\non  his  sleeve. \\n\\nThey  went  on.  But  before  long  the  snow  was  falling  fast, \\nfilling  all  the  air,  and  swirling  into  Frodo’s  eyes.  The  dark \\nbent  shapes  of  Gandalf  and  Aragorn  only  a  pace  or  two  ahead \\ncould  hardly  be  seen. \\n\\n‘I  don’t  like  this  at  all,’  panted  Sam  just  behind.  ‘Snow’s \\nall  right  on  a  fine  morning,  but  I  like  to  be  in  bed  while  it’s \\nfalling.  I  wish  this  lot  would  go  off  to  Hobbiton!  Folk  might \\nwelcome  it  there.’  Except  on  the  high  moors  of  the  North¬ \\nfarthing  a  heavy  fall  was  rare  in  the  Shire,  and  was  regarded \\nas  a  pleasant  event  and  a  chance  for  fun.  No  living  hobbit \\n(save  Bilbo)  could  remember  the  Fell  Winter  of  13 11,  when \\nwhite  wolves  invaded  the  Shire  over  the  frozen  Brandywine. \\n\\nGandalf  halted.  Snow  was  thick  on  his  hood  and  shoulders; \\nit  was  already  ankle-deep  about  his  boots. \\n\\n‘This  is  what  I  feared,’  he  said.  ‘What  do  you  say  now, \\nAragorn?’ \\n\\n‘That  I  feared  it  too,’  Aragorn  answered,  ‘but  less  than \\nother  things.  I  knew  the  risk  of  snow,  though  it  seldom  falls \\nheavily  so  far  south,  save  high  up  in  the  mountains.  But  we \\nare  not  high  yet;  we  are  still  far  down,  where  the  paths  are \\nusually  open  all  the  winter.’ \\n\\n‘I  wonder  if  this  is  a  contrivance  of  the  Enemy,’  said \\nBoromir.  ‘They  say  in  my  land  that  he  can  govern  the  storms \\nin  the  Mountains  of  Shadow  that  stand  upon  the  borders  of \\nMordor.  He  has  strange  powers  and  many  allies.’ \\n\\n\\n376 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘His  arm  has  grown  long  indeed,’  said  Gimli,  ‘if  he  can \\ndraw  snow  down  from  the  North  to  trouble  us  here  three \\nhundred  leagues  away.’ \\n\\n‘His  arm  has  grown  long,’  said  Gandalf. \\n\\nWhile  they  were  halted,  the  wind  died  down,  and  the \\nsnow  slackened  until  it  almost  ceased.  They  tramped  on \\nagain.  But  they  had  not  gone  more  than  a  furlong  when \\nthe  storm  returned  with  fresh  fury.  The  wind  whistled  and \\nthe  snow  became  a  blinding  blizzard.  Soon  even  Boromir \\nfound  it  hard  to  keep  going.  The  hobbits,  bent  nearly  double, \\ntoiled  along  behind  the  taller  folk,  but  it  was  plain  that  they \\ncould  not  go  much  further,  if  the  snow  continued.  Frodo’s \\nfeet  felt  like  lead.  Pippin  was  dragging  behind.  Even  Gimli, \\nas  stout  as  any  dwarf  could  be,  was  grumbling  as  he \\ntrudged. \\n\\nThe  Company  halted  suddenly,  as  if  they  had  come  to  an \\nagreement  without  any  words  being  spoken.  They  heard  eerie \\nnoises  in  the  darkness  round  them.  It  may  have  been  only  a \\ntrick  of  the  wind  in  the  cracks  and  gullies  of  the  rocky  wall, \\nbut  the  sounds  were  those  of  shrill  cries,  and  wild  howls  of \\nlaughter.  Stones  began  to  fall  from  the  mountain-side,  whist¬ \\nling  over  their  heads,  or  crashing  on  the  path  beside  them. \\nEvery  now  and  again  they  heard  a  dull  rumble,  as  a  great \\nboulder  rolled  down  from  hidden  heights  above. \\n\\n‘We  cannot  go  further  tonight,’  said  Boromir.  ‘Let  those \\ncall  it  the  wind  who  will;  there  are  fell  voices  on  the  air;  and \\nthese  stones  are  aimed  at  us.’ \\n\\n‘I  do  call  it  the  wind,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘But  that  does  not \\nmake  what  you  say  untrue.  There  are  many  evil  and \\nunfriendly  things  in  the  world  that  have  little  love  for  those \\nthat  go  on  two  legs,  and  yet  are  not  in  league  with  Sauron, \\nbut  have  purposes  of  their  own.  Some  have  been  in  this  world \\nlonger  than  he.’ \\n\\n‘Caradhras  was  called  the  Cruel,  and  had  an  ill  name,’  said \\nGimli,  ‘long  years  ago,  when  rumour  of  Sauron  had  not  been \\nheard  in  these  lands.’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH  377 \\n\\n‘It  matters  little  who  is  the  enemy,  if  we  cannot  beat  off  his \\nattack,’  said  Gandalf. \\n\\n‘But  what  can  we  do?’  cried  Pippin  miserably.  He  was \\nleaning  on  Merry  and  Frodo,  and  he  was  shivering. \\n\\n‘Either  stop  where  we  are,  or  go  back,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘It  is \\nno  good  going  on.  Only  a  little  higher,  if  I  remember  rightly, \\nthis  path  leaves  the  cliff  and  runs  into  a  wide  shallow  trough \\nat  the  bottom  of  a  long  hard  slope.  We  should  have  no  shelter \\nthere  from  snow,  or  stones  -  or  anything  else.’ \\n\\n‘And  it  is  no  good  going  back  while  the  storm  holds,’  said \\nAragorn.  ‘We  have  passed  no  place  on  the  way  up  that  offered \\nmore  shelter  than  this  cliff- wall  we  are  under  now.’ \\n\\n‘Shelter!’  muttered  Sam.  ‘If  this  is  shelter,  then  one  wall \\nand  no  roof  make  a  house.’ \\n\\nThe  Company  now  gathered  together  as  close  to  the  cliff \\nas  they  could.  It  faced  southwards,  and  near  the  bottom  it \\nleaned  out  a  little,  so  that  they  hoped  it  would  give  them \\nsome  protection  from  the  northerly  wind  and  from  the  falling \\nstones.  But  eddying  blasts  swirled  round  them  from  every \\nside,  and  the  snow  flowed  down  in  ever  denser  clouds. \\n\\nThey  huddled  together  with  their  backs  to  the  wall.  Bill  the \\npony  stood  patiently  but  dejectedly  in  front  of  the  hobbits, \\nand  screened  them  a  little;  but  before  long  the  drifting  snow \\nwas  above  his  hocks,  and  it  went  on  mounting.  If  they  had \\nhad  no  larger  companions  the  hobbits  would  soon  have  been \\nentirely  buried. \\n\\nA  great  sleepiness  came  over  Frodo;  he  felt  himself  sinking \\nfast  into  a  warm  and  hazy  dream.  He  thought  a  fire  was \\nheating  his  toes,  and  out  of  the  shadows  on  the  other  side  of \\nthe  hearth  he  heard  Bilbo’s  voice  speaking.  I  don’t  think  much \\nof  your  diary,  he  said.  Snowstorms  on  January  the  twelfth:  there \\nwas  no  need  to  come  back  to  report  that! \\n\\nBut  I  wanted  rest  and  sleep,  Bilbo,  Frodo  answered  with  an \\neffort,  when  he  felt  himself  shaken,  and  he  came  back  pain¬ \\nfully  to  wakefulness.  Boromir  had  lifted  him  off  the  ground \\nout  of  a  nest  of  snow. \\n\\n\\n378 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘This  will  be  the  death  of  the  halflings,  Gandalf,’  said \\nBoromir.  ‘It  is  useless  to  sit  here  until  the  snow  goes  over  our \\nheads.  We  must  do  something  to  save  ourselves.’ \\n\\n‘Give  them  this,’  said  Gandalf,  searching  in  his  pack  and \\ndrawing  out  a  leathern  flask.  ‘Just  a  mouthful  each  -  for  all \\nof  us.  It  is  very  precious.  It  is  miruvor,  the  cordial  of  Imladris. \\nElrond  gave  it  to  me  at  our  parting.  Pass  it  round!’ \\n\\nAs  soon  as  Frodo  had  swallowed  a  little  of  the  warm  and \\nfragrant  liquor  he  felt  a  new  strength  of  heart,  and  the \\nheavy  drowsiness  left  his  limbs.  The  others  also  revived  and \\nfound  fresh  hope  and  vigour.  But  the  snow  did  not  relent.  It \\nwhirled  about  them  thicker  than  ever,  and  the  wind  blew \\nlouder. \\n\\n‘What  do  you  say  to  fire?’  asked  Boromir  suddenly.  ‘The \\nchoice  seems  near  now  between  fire  and  death,  Gandalf. \\nDoubtless  we  shall  be  hidden  from  all  unfriendly  eyes  when \\nthe  snow  has  covered  us,  but  that  will  not  help  us.’ \\n\\n‘You  may  make  a  fire,  if  you  can,’  answered  Gandalf.  ‘If \\nthere  are  any  watchers  that  can  endure  this  storm,  then  they \\ncan  see  us,  fire  or  no.’ \\n\\nBut  though  they  had  brought  wood  and  kindlings  by  the \\nadvice  of  Boromir,  it  passed  the  skill  of  Elf  or  even  Dwarf  to \\nstrike  a  flame  that  would  hold  amid  the  swirling  wind  or  catch \\nin  the  wet  fuel.  At  last  reluctantly  Gandalf  himself  took  a \\nhand.  Picking  up  a  faggot  he  held  it  aloft  for  a  moment,  and \\nthen  with  a  word  of  command,  naur  an  edraith  ammen!  he \\nthrust  the  end  of  his  staff  into  the  midst  of  it.  At  once  a  great \\nspout  of  green  and  blue  flame  sprang  out,  and  the  wood \\nflared  and  sputtered. \\n\\n‘If  there  are  any  to  see,  then  I  at  least  am  revealed  to  them,’ \\nhe  said.  ‘I  have  written  Gandalf  is  here  in  signs  that  all  can \\nread  from  Rivendell  to  the  mouths  of  Anduin.’ \\n\\nBut  the  Company  cared  no  longer  for  watchers  or  un¬ \\nfriendly  eyes.  Their  hearts  were  rejoiced  to  see  the  light  of \\nthe  fire.  The  wood  burned  merrily;  and  though  all  round  it \\nthe  snow  hissed,  and  pools  of  slush  crept  under  their  feet, \\nthey  warmed  their  hands  gladly  at  the  blaze.  There  they \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n379 \\n\\n\\nstood,  stooping  in  a  circle  round  the  little  dancing  and  blow¬ \\ning  flames.  A  red  light  was  on  their  tired  and  anxious  faces; \\nbehind  them  the  night  was  like  a  black  wall. \\n\\nBut  the  wood  was  burning  fast,  and  the  snow  still  fell. \\n\\nThe  fire  burned  low,  and  the  last  faggot  was  thrown  on. \\n\\n‘The  night  is  getting  old,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘The  dawn  is  not \\nfar  off.’ \\n\\n‘If  any  dawn  can  pierce  these  clouds,’  said  Gimli. \\n\\nBoromir  stepped  out  of  the  circle  and  stared  up  into  the \\nblackness.  ‘The  snow  is  growing  less,’  he  said,  ‘and  the  wind \\nis  quieter.’ \\n\\nFrodo  gazed  wearily  at  the  flakes  still  falling  out  of  the  dark \\nto  be  revealed  white  for  a  moment  in  the  light  of  the  dying \\nfire;  but  for  a  long  time  he  could  see  no  sign  of  their  slacken¬ \\ning.  Then  suddenly,  as  sleep  was  beginning  to  creep  over \\nhim  again,  he  was  aware  that  the  wind  had  indeed  fallen,  and \\nthe  flakes  were  becoming  larger  and  fewer.  Very  slowly  a  dim \\nlight  began  to  grow.  At  last  the  snow  stopped  altogether. \\n\\nAs  the  light  grew  stronger  it  showed  a  silent  shrouded \\nworld.  Below  their  refuge  were  white  humps  and  domes  and \\nshapeless  deeps  beneath  which  the  path  that  they  had  trodden \\nwas  altogether  lost;  but  the  heights  above  were  hidden  in \\ngreat  clouds  still  heavy  with  the  threat  of  snow. \\n\\nGimli  looked  up  and  shook  his  head.  ‘Caradhras  has  not \\nforgiven  us,’  he  said.  ‘He  has  more  snow  yet  to  fling  at  us,  if \\nwe  go  on.  The  sooner  we  go  back  and  down  the  better.’ \\n\\nTo  this  all  agreed,  but  their  retreat  was  now  difficult.  It \\nmight  well  prove  impossible.  Only  a  few  paces  from  the  ashes \\nof  their  fire  the  snow  lay  many  feet  deep,  higher  than  the \\nheads  of  the  hobbits;  in  places  it  had  been  scooped  and  piled \\nby  the  wind  into  great  drifts  against  the  cliff. \\n\\n‘If  Gandalf  would  go  before  us  with  a  bright  flame,  he \\nmight  melt  a  path  for  you,’  said  Legolas.  The  storm  had \\ntroubled  him  little,  and  he  alone  of  the  Company  remained \\nstill  light  of  heart. \\n\\n‘If  Elves  could  fly  over  mountains,  they  might  fetch  the  Sun \\n\\n\\n380  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nto  save  us,’  answered  Gandalf.  ‘But  I  must  have  something  to \\nwork  on.  I  cannot  burn  snow.’ \\n\\n‘Well,’  said  Boromir,  ‘when  heads  are  at  a  loss  bodies  must \\nserve,  as  we  say  in  my  country.  The  strongest  of  us  must \\nseek  a  way.  See!  Though  all  is  now  snow-clad,  our  path,  as \\nwe  came  up,  turned  about  that  shoulder  of  rock  down  yonder. \\nIt  was  there  that  the  snow  first  began  to  burden  us.  If  we \\ncould  reach  that  point,  maybe  it  would  prove  easier  beyond. \\nIt  is  no  more  than  a  furlong  off,  I  guess.’ \\n\\n‘Then  let  us  force  a  path  thither,  you  and  I!’  said  Aragorn. \\n\\nAragorn  was  the  tallest  of  the  Company,  but  Boromir,  little \\nless  in  height,  was  broader  and  heavier  in  build.  He  led  the \\nway,  and  Aragorn  followed  him.  Slowly  they  moved  off,  and \\nwere  soon  toiling  heavily.  In  places  the  snow  was  breast-high, \\nand  often  Boromir  seemed  to  be  swimming  or  burrowing \\nwith  his  great  arms  rather  than  walking. \\n\\nLegolas  watched  them  for  a  while  with  a  smile  upon  his \\nlips,  and  then  he  turned  to  the  others.  ‘The  strongest  must \\nseek  a  way,  say  you?  But  I  say:  let  a  ploughman  plough,  but \\nchoose  an  otter  for  swimming,  and  for  running  light  over \\ngrass  and  leaf,  or  over  snow  -  an  Elf.’ \\n\\nWith  that  he  sprang  forth  nimbly,  and  then  Frodo  noticed \\nas  if  for  the  first  time,  though  he  had  long  known  it,  that  the \\nElf  had  no  boots,  but  wore  only  light  shoes,  as  he  always  did, \\nand  his  feet  made  little  imprint  in  the  snow. \\n\\n‘Farewell!’  he  said  to  Gandalf.  ‘I  go  to  find  the  Sun!’  Then \\nswift  as  a  runner  over  firm  sand  he  shot  away,  and  quickly \\novertaking  the  toiling  men,  with  a  wave  of  his  hand  he  passed \\nthem,  and  sped  into  the  distance,  and  vanished  round  the \\nrocky  turn. \\n\\nThe  others  waited  huddled  together,  watching  until \\nBoromir  and  Aragorn  dwindled  into  black  specks  in  the \\nwhiteness.  At  length  they  too  passed  from  sight.  The  time \\ndragged  on.  The  clouds  lowered,  and  now  a  few  flakes  of \\nsnow  came  curling  down  again. \\n\\nAn  hour,  maybe,  went  by,  though  it  seemed  far  longer, \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n381 \\n\\n\\nand  then  at  last  they  saw  Legolas  coming  back.  At  the  same \\ntime  Boromir  and  Aragorn  reappeared  round  the  bend  far \\nbehind  him  and  came  labouring  up  the  slope. \\n\\n‘Well,’  cried  Legolas  as  he  ran  up,  ‘I  have  not  brought  the \\nSun.  She  is  walking  in  the  blue  fields  of  the  South,  and  a  little \\nwreath  of  snow  on  this  Redhorn  hillock  troubles  her  not  at \\nall.  But  I  have  brought  back  a  gleam  of  good  hope  for  those \\nwho  are  doomed  to  go  on  feet.  There  is  the  greatest  wind-drift \\nof  all  just  beyond  the  turn,  and  there  our  Strong  Men  were \\nalmost  buried.  They  despaired,  until  I  returned  and  told  them \\nthat  the  drift  was  little  wider  than  a  wall.  And  on  the  other \\nside  the  snow  suddenly  grows  less,  while  further  down  it  is \\nno  more  than  a  white  coverlet  to  cool  a  hobbit’s  toes.’ \\n\\n‘Ah,  it  is  as  I  said,’  growled  Gimli.  ‘It  was  no  ordinary \\nstorm.  It  is  the  ill  will  of  Caradhras.  He  does  not  love  Elves \\nand  Dwarves,  and  that  drift  was  laid  to  cut  off  our  escape.’ \\n\\n‘But  happily  your  Caradhras  has  forgotten  that  you  have \\nMen  with  you,’  said  Boromir,  who  came  up  at  that  moment. \\n‘And  doughty  Men  too,  if  I  may  say  it;  though  lesser  men \\nwith  spades  might  have  served  you  better.  Still,  we  have \\nthrust  a  lane  through  the  drift;  and  for  that  all  here  may  be \\ngrateful  who  cannot  run  as  light  as  Elves.’ \\n\\n‘But  how  are  we  to  get  down  there,  even  if  you  have  cut \\nthrough  the  drift?’  said  Pippin,  voicing  the  thought  of  all  the \\nhobbits. \\n\\n‘Have  hope!’  said  Boromir.  ‘I  am  weary,  but  I  still  have \\nsome  strength  left,  and  Aragorn  too.  We  will  bear  the  little \\nfolk.  The  others  no  doubt  will  make  shift  to  tread  the  path \\nbehind  us.  Come,  Master  Peregrin!  I  will  begin  with  you.’ \\n\\nHe  lifted  up  the  hobbit.  ‘Cling  to  my  back!  I  shall  need  my \\narms,’  he  said  and  strode  forward.  Aragorn  with  Merry  came \\nbehind.  Pippin  marvelled  at  his  strength,  seeing  the  passage \\nthat  he  had  already  forced  with  no  other  tool  than  his  great \\nlimbs.  Even  now,  burdened  as  he  was,  he  was  widening  the \\ntrack  for  those  who  followed,  thrusting  the  snow  aside  as \\nhe  went. \\n\\nThey  came  at  length  to  the  great  drift.  It  was  flung  across \\n\\n\\n382 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nthe  mountain-path  like  a  sheer  and  sudden  wall,  and  its  crest, \\nsharp  as  if  shaped  with  knives,  reared  up  more  than  twice  the \\nheight  of  Boromir;  but  through  the  middle  a  passage  had \\nbeen  beaten,  rising  and  falling  like  a  bridge.  On  the  far  side \\nMerry  and  Pippin  were  set  down,  and  there  they  waited  with \\nLegolas  for  the  rest  of  the  Company  to  arrive. \\n\\nAfter  a  while  Boromir  returned  carrying  Sam.  Behind  in \\nthe  narrow  but  now  well-trodden  track  came  Gandalf,  leading \\nBill  with  Gimli  perched  among  the  baggage.  Last  came \\nAragorn  carrying  Frodo.  They  passed  through  the  lane;  but \\nhardly  had  Frodo  touched  the  ground  when  with  a  deep \\nrumble  there  rolled  down  a  fall  of  stones  and  slithering  snow. \\nThe  spray  of  it  half  blinded  the  Company  as  they  crouched \\nagainst  the  cliff,  and  when  the  air  cleared  again  they  saw  that \\nthe  path  was  blocked  behind  them. \\n\\n‘Enough,  enough!’  cried  Gimli.  ‘We  are  departing  as  quickly \\nas  we  may!’  And  indeed  with  that  last  stroke  the  malice  of  the \\nmountain  seemed  to  be  expended,  as  if  Caradhras  was  satisfied \\nthat  the  invaders  had  been  beaten  off  and  would  not  dare  to \\nreturn.  The  threat  of  snow  lifted;  the  clouds  began  to  break \\nand  the  light  grew  broader. \\n\\nAs  Legolas  had  reported,  they  found  that  the  snow  became \\nsteadily  more  shallow  as  they  went  down,  so  that  even  the \\nhobbits  could  trudge  along.  Soon  they  all  stood  once  more \\non  the  flat  shelf  at  the  head  of  the  steep  slope  where  they  had \\nfelt  the  first  flakes  of  snow  the  night  before. \\n\\nThe  morning  was  now  far  advanced.  From  the  high  place \\nthey  looked  back  westwards  over  the  lower  lands.  Far  away \\nin  the  tumble  of  country  that  lay  at  the  foot  of  the  mountain \\nwas  the  dell  from  which  they  had  started  to  climb  the  pass. \\n\\nFrodo’s  legs  ached.  He  was  chilled  to  the  bone  and  hungry; \\nand  his  head  was  dizzy  as  he  thought  of  the  long  and  painful \\nmarch  downhill.  Black  specks  swam  before  his  eyes.  He \\nrubbed  them,  but  the  black  specks  remained.  In  the  distance \\nbelow  him,  but  still  high  above  the  lower  foothills,  dark  dots \\nwere  circling  in  the  air. \\n\\n‘The  birds  again!’  said  Aragorn,  pointing  down. \\n\\n\\nTHE  RING  GOES  SOUTH \\n\\n\\n383 \\n\\n\\n‘That  cannot  be  helped  now,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Whether  they \\nare  good  or  evil,  or  have  nothing  to  do  with  us  at  all,  we  must \\ngo  down  at  once.  Not  even  on  the  knees  of  Caradhras  will \\nwe  wait  for  another  night-fall!’ \\n\\nA  cold  wind  flowed  down  behind  them,  as  they  turned \\ntheir  backs  on  the  Redhorn  Gate,  and  stumbled  wearily  down \\nthe  slope.  Caradhras  had  defeated  them. \\n\\n\\nChapter  4 \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\nIt  was  evening,  and  the  grey  light  was  again  waning  fast, \\nwhen  they  halted  for  the  night.  They  were  very  weary.  The \\nmountains  were  veiled  in  deepening  dusk,  and  the  wind  was \\ncold.  Gandalf  spared  them  one  more  mouthful  each  of  the \\nmiruvor  of  Rivendell.  When  they  had  eaten  some  food  he \\ncalled  a  council. \\n\\nWe  cannot,  of  course,  go  on  again  tonight,’  he  said.  ‘The \\nattack  on  the  Redhorn  Gate  has  tired  us  out,  and  we  must \\nrest  here  for  a  while.’ \\n\\n‘And  then  where  are  we  to  go?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘We  still  have  our  journey  and  our  errand  before  us,’ \\nanswered  Gandalf.  ‘We  have  no  choice  but  to  go  on,  or  to \\nreturn  to  Rivendell.’ \\n\\nPippin’s  face  brightened  visibly  at  the  mere  mention  of \\nreturn  to  Rivendell;  Merry  and  Sam  looked  up  hopefully.  But \\nAragorn  and  Boromir  made  no  sign.  Frodo  looked  troubled. \\n\\n‘I  wish  I  was  back  there,’  he  said.  ‘But  how  can  I  return \\nwithout  shame  -  unless  there  is  indeed  no  other  way,  and  we \\nare  already  defeated?’ \\n\\n‘You  are  right,  Frodo,’  said  Gandalf:  ‘to  go  back  is  to  admit \\ndefeat,  and  face  worse  defeat  to  come.  If  we  go  back  now, \\nthen  the  Ring  must  remain  there:  we  shall  not  be  able  to  set \\nout  again.  Then  sooner  or  later  Rivendell  will  be  besieged, \\nand  after  a  brief  and  bitter  time  it  will  be  destroyed.  The \\nRingwraiths  are  deadly  enemies,  but  they  are  only  shadows \\nyet  of  the  power  and  terror  they  would  possess  if  the  Ruling \\nRing  was  on  their  master’s  hand  again.’ \\n\\n‘Then  we  must  go  on,  if  there  is  a  way,’  said  Frodo  with  a \\nsigh.  Sam  sank  back  into  gloom. \\n\\n‘There  is  a  way  that  we  may  attempt,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘I \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n385 \\n\\n\\nthought  from  the  beginning,  when  first  I  considered  this  jour¬ \\nney,  that  we  should  try  it.  But  it  is  not  a  pleasant  way,  and  I \\nhave  not  spoken  of  it  to  the  Company  before.  Aragorn  was \\nagainst  it,  until  the  pass  over  the  mountains  had  at  least  been \\ntried.’ \\n\\n‘If  it  is  a  worse  road  than  the  Redhorn  Gate,  then  it  must \\nbe  evil  indeed,’  said  Merry.  ‘But  you  had  better  tell  us  about \\nit,  and  let  us  know  the  worst  at  once.’ \\n\\n‘The  road  that  I  speak  of  leads  to  the  Mines  of  Moria,’  said \\nGandalf.  Only  Gimli  lifted  up  his  head;  a  smouldering  fire \\nwas  in  his  eyes.  On  all  the  others  a  dread  fell  at  the  mention \\nof  that  name.  Even  to  the  hobbits  it  was  a  legend  of  vague \\nfear. \\n\\n‘The  road  may  lead  to  Moria,  but  how  can  we  hope  that  it \\nwill  lead  through  Moria?’  said  Aragorn  darkly. \\n\\n‘It  is  a  name  of  ill  omen,’  said  Boromir.  ‘Nor  do  I  see  the \\nneed  to  go  there.  If  we  cannot  cross  the  mountains,  let  us \\njourney  southwards,  until  we  come  to  the  Gap  of  Rohan, \\nwhere  men  are  friendly  to  my  people,  taking  the  road  that  I \\nfollowed  on  my  way  hither.  Or  we  might  pass  by  and  cross \\nthe  Isen  into  Langstrand  and  Lebennin,  and  so  come  to \\nGondor  from  the  regions  nigh  to  the  sea.’ \\n\\n‘Things  have  changed  since  you  came  north,  Boromir,’ \\nanswered  Gandalf.  ‘Did  you  not  hear  what  I  told  you  of \\nSaruman?  With  him  I  may  have  business  of  my  own  ere  all \\nis  over.  But  the  Ring  must  not  come  near  Isengard,  if  that \\ncan  by  any  means  be  prevented.  The  Gap  of  Rohan  is  closed \\nto  us  while  we  go  with  the  Bearer. \\n\\n‘As  for  the  longer  road:  we  cannot  afford  the  time.  We \\nmight  spend  a  year  in  such  a  journey,  and  we  should  pass \\nthrough  many  lands  that  are  empty  and  harbourless.  Yet  they \\nwould  not  be  safe.  The  watchful  eyes  both  of  Saruman  and \\nof  the  Enemy  are  on  them.  When  you  came  north,  Boromir, \\nyou  were  in  the  Enemy’s  eyes  only  one  stray  wanderer  from \\nthe  South  and  a  matter  of  small  concern  to  him:  his  mind \\nwas  busy  with  the  pursuit  of  the  Ring.  But  you  return  now \\nas  a  member  of  the  Ring’s  Company,  and  you  are  in  peril  as \\n\\n\\n386 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nlong  as  you  remain  with  us.  The  danger  will  increase  with \\nevery  league  that  we  go  south  under  the  naked  sky. \\n\\n‘Since  our  open  attempt  on  the  mountain-pass  our  plight \\nhas  become  more  desperate,  I  fear.  I  see  now  little  hope, \\nif  we  do  not  soon  vanish  from  sight  for  a  while,  and  cover \\nour  trail.  Therefore  I  advise  that  we  should  go  neither  over \\nthe  mountains,  nor  round  them,  but  under  them.  That  is \\na  road  at  any  rate  that  the  Enemy  will  least  expect  us  to \\ntake.’ \\n\\n‘We  do  not  know  what  he  expects,’  said  Boromir.  ‘He  may \\nwatch  all  roads,  likely  and  unlikely.  In  that  case  to  enter  Moria \\nwould  be  to  walk  into  a  trap,  hardly  better  than  knocking  at \\nthe  gates  of  the  Dark  Tower  itself.  The  name  of  Moria  is \\nblack.’ \\n\\n‘You  speak  of  what  you  do  not  know,  when  you  liken \\nMoria  to  the  stronghold  of  Sauron,’  answered  Gandalf.  ‘I \\nalone  of  you  have  ever  been  in  the  dungeons  of  the  Dark \\nLord,  and  only  in  his  older  and  lesser  dwelling  in  Dol  Guldur. \\nThose  who  pass  the  gates  of  Barad-dur  do  not  return.  But  I \\nwould  not  lead  you  into  Moria  if  there  were  no  hope  of \\ncoming  out  again.  If  there  are  Ores  there,  it  may  prove  ill  for \\nus,  that  is  true.  But  most  of  the  Ores  of  the  Misty  Mountains \\nwere  scattered  or  destroyed  in  the  Battle  of  Five  Armies.  The \\nEagles  report  that  Ores  are  gathering  again  from  afar;  but \\nthere  is  a  hope  that  Moria  is  still  free. \\n\\n‘There  is  even  a  chance  that  Dwarves  are  there,  and  that \\nin  some  deep  hall  of  his  fathers,  Balin  son  of  Fundin  may  be \\nfound.  However  it  may  prove,  one  must  tread  the  path  that \\nneed  chooses!’ \\n\\n‘I  will  tread  the  path  with  you,  Gandalf!’  said  Gimli.  ‘I  will \\ngo  and  look  on  the  halls  of  Durin,  whatever  may  wait  there \\n-  if  you  can  find  the  doors  that  are  shut.’ \\n\\n‘Good,  Gimli!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘You  encourage  me.  We  will \\nseek  the  hidden  doors  together.  And  we  will  come  through. \\nIn  the  ruins  of  the  Dwarves,  a  dwarf’s  head  will  be  less  easy \\nto  bewilder  than  Elves  or  Men  or  Hobbits.  Yet  it  will  not  be \\nthe  first  time  that  I  have  been  to  Moria.  I  sought  there  long \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK  387 \\n\\nfor  Thrain  son  of  Thror  after  he  was  lost.  I  passed  through, \\nand  I  came  out  again  alive!’ \\n\\n‘I  too  once  passed  the  Dimrill  Gate,’  said  Aragorn  quietly; \\n‘but  though  I  also  came  out  again,  the  memory  is  very  evil.  I \\ndo  not  wish  to  enter  Moria  a  second  time.’ \\n\\n‘And  I  don’t  wish  to  enter  it  even  once,’  said  Pippin. \\n\\n‘Nor  me,’  muttered  Sam. \\n\\n‘Of  course  not!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Who  would?  But  the  ques¬ \\ntion  is:  who  will  follow  me,  if  I  lead  you  there?’ \\n\\n‘I  will,’  said  Gimli  eagerly. \\n\\n‘I  will,’  said  Aragorn  heavily.  ‘You  followed  my  lead  almost \\nto  disaster  in  the  snow,  and  have  said  no  word  of  blame.  I \\nwill  follow  your  lead  now  -  if  this  last  warning  does  not  move \\nyou.  It  is  not  of  the  Ring,  nor  of  us  others  that  I  am  thinking \\nnow,  but  of  you,  Gandalf.  And  I  say  to  you:  if  you  pass  the \\ndoors  of  Moria,  beware!’ \\n\\n‘I  will  not  go,’  said  Boromir;  ‘not  unless  the  vote  of \\nthe  whole  Company  is  against  me.  What  do  Legolas  and  the \\nlittle  folk  say?  The  Ring-bearer’s  voice  surely  should  be \\nheard?’ \\n\\n‘I  do  not  wish  to  go  to  Moria,’  said  Legolas. \\n\\nThe  hobbits  said  nothing.  Sam  looked  at  Frodo.  At  last \\nFrodo  spoke.  ‘I  do  not  wish  to  go,’  he  said;  ‘but  neither  do  I \\nwish  to  refuse  the  advice  of  Gandalf.  I  beg  that  there  should \\nbe  no  vote,  until  we  have  slept  on  it.  Gandalf  will  get  votes \\neasier  in  the  light  of  the  morning  than  in  this  cold  gloom. \\nHow  the  wind  howls!’ \\n\\nAt  these  words  all  fell  into  silent  thought.  They  heard  the \\nwind  hissing  among  the  rocks  and  trees,  and  there  was  a \\nhowling  and  wailing  round  them  in  the  empty  spaces  of  the \\nnight. \\n\\nSuddenly  Aragorn  leapt  to  his  feet.  ‘How  the  wind  howls!’ \\nhe  cried.  ‘It  is  howling  with  wolf- voices.  The  Wargs  have \\ncome  west  of  the  Mountains!’ \\n\\n‘Need  we  wait  until  morning  then?’  said  Gandalf.  ‘It  is  as \\nI  said.  The  hunt  is  up!  Even  if  we  live  to  see  the  dawn,  who \\n\\n\\n388 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nnow  will  wish  to  journey  south  by  night  with  the  wild  wolves \\non  his  trail?’ \\n\\n‘How  far  is  Moria?’  asked  Boromir. \\n\\n‘There  was  a  door  south-west  of  Caradhras,  some  fifteen \\nmiles  as  the  crow  flies,  and  maybe  twenty  as  the  wolf  runs,’ \\nanswered  Gandalf  grimly. \\n\\n‘Then  let  us  start  as  soon  as  it  is  light  tomorrow,  if  we  can,’ \\nsaid  Boromir.  ‘The  wolf  that  one  hears  is  worse  than  the  ore \\nthat  one  fears.’ \\n\\n‘True!’  said  Aragorn,  loosening  his  sword  in  its  sheath. \\n‘But  where  the  warg  howls,  there  also  the  ore  prowls.’ \\n\\n‘I  wish  I  had  taken  Elrond’s  advice,’  muttered  Pippin  to \\nSam.  ‘I  am  no  good  after  all.  There  is  not  enough  of  the \\nbreed  of  Bandobras  the  Bullroarer  in  me:  these  howls  freeze \\nmy  blood.  I  don’t  ever  remember  feeling  so  wretched.’ \\n\\n‘My  heart’s  right  down  in  my  toes,  Mr.  Pippin,’  said  Sam. \\n‘But  we  aren’t  etten  yet,  and  there  are  some  stout  folk  here \\nwith  us.  Whatever  may  be  in  store  for  old  Gandalf,  I’ll  wager \\nit  isn’t  a  wolf’s  belly.’ \\n\\nFor  their  defence  in  the  night  the  Company  climbed  to  the \\ntop  of  the  small  hill  under  which  they  had  been  sheltering.  It \\nwas  crowned  with  a  knot  of  old  and  twisted  trees,  about \\nwhich  lay  a  broken  circle  of  boulder-stones.  In  the  midst  of \\nthis  they  lit  a  fire,  for  there  was  no  hope  that  darkness  and \\nsilence  would  keep  their  trail  from  discovery  by  the  hunting \\npacks. \\n\\nRound  the  fire  they  sat,  and  those  that  were  not  on  guard \\ndozed  uneasily.  Poor  Bill  the  pony  trembled  and  sweated \\nwhere  he  stood.  The  howling  of  the  wolves  was  now  all  round \\nthem,  sometimes  nearer  and  sometimes  further  off.  In  the \\ndead  of  night  many  shining  eyes  were  seen  peering  over  the \\nbrow  of  the  hill.  Some  advanced  almost  to  the  ring  of  stones. \\nAt  a  gap  in  the  circle  a  great  dark  wolf-shape  could  be \\nseen  halted,  gazing  at  them.  A  shuddering  howl  broke  from \\nhim,  as  if  he  were  a  captain  summoning  his  pack  to  the \\nassault. \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n389 \\n\\n\\nGandalf  stood  up  and  strode  forward,  holding  his  staff \\naloft.  ‘Listen,  Hound  of  Sauron!’  he  cried.  ‘Gandalf  is  here. \\nFly,  if  you  value  your  foul  skin!  I  will  shrivel  you  from  tail  to \\nsnout,  if  you  come  within  this  ring.’ \\n\\nThe  wolf  snarled  and  sprang  towards  them  with  a  great \\nleap.  At  that  moment  there  was  a  sharp  twang.  Legolas  had \\nloosed  his  bow.  There  was  a  hideous  yell,  and  the  leaping \\nshape  thudded  to  the  ground;  the  Elvish  arrow  had  pierced \\nits  throat.  The  watching  eyes  were  suddenly  extinguished. \\nGandalf  and  Aragorn  strode  forward,  but  the  hill  was \\ndeserted;  the  hunting  packs  had  fled.  All  about  them  the \\ndarkness  grew  silent,  and  no  cry  came  on  the  sighing  wind. \\n\\nThe  night  was  old,  and  westward  the  waning  moon  was \\nsetting,  gleaming  fitfully  through  the  breaking  clouds.  Sud¬ \\ndenly  Frodo  started  from  sleep.  Without  warning  a  storm  of \\nhowls  broke  out  fierce  and  wild  all  about  the  camp.  A  great \\nhost  of  Wargs  had  gathered  silently  and  was  now  attacking \\nthem  from  every  side  at  once. \\n\\n‘Fling  fuel  on  the  fire!’  cried  Gandalf  to  the  hobbits.  ‘Draw \\nyour  blades,  and  stand  back  to  back!’ \\n\\nIn  the  leaping  light,  as  the  fresh  wood  blazed  up,  Frodo \\nsaw  many  grey  shapes  spring  over  the  ring  of  stones.  More \\nand  more  followed.  Through  the  throat  of  one  huge  leader \\nAragorn  passed  his  sword  with  a  thrust;  with  a  great  sweep \\nBoromir  hewed  the  head  off  another.  Beside  them  Gimli \\nstood  with  his  stout  legs  apart,  wielding  his  dwarf-axe.  The \\nbow  of  Legolas  was  singing. \\n\\nIn  the  wavering  firelight  Gandalf  seemed  suddenly  to  grow: \\nhe  rose  up,  a  great  menacing  shape  like  the  monument  of \\nsome  ancient  king  of  stone  set  upon  a  hill.  Stooping  like  a \\ncloud,  he  lifted  a  burning  branch  and  strode  to  meet  the \\nwolves.  They  gave  back  before  him.  High  in  the  air  he  tossed \\nthe  blazing  brand.  It  flared  with  a  sudden  white  radiance  like \\nlightning;  and  his  voice  rolled  like  thunder. \\n\\n‘ Naur  an  edraith  ammen!  Naur  dan  i  ngaurhothF  he  cried. \\n\\nThere  was  a  roar  and  a  crackle,  and  the  tree  above  him \\n\\n\\n390 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nburst  into  a  leaf  and  bloom  of  blinding  flame.  The  fire  leapt \\nfrom  tree-top  to  tree-top.  The  whole  hill  was  crowned  with \\ndazzling  light.  The  swords  and  knives  of  the  defenders  shone \\nand  flickered.  The  last  arrow  of  Legolas  kindled  in  the  air \\nas  it  flew,  and  plunged  burning  into  the  heart  of  a  great \\nwolf-chieftain.  All  the  others  fled. \\n\\nSlowly  the  fire  died  till  nothing  was  left  but  falling  ash  and \\nsparks;  a  bitter  smoke  curled  above  the  burned  tree-stumps, \\nand  blew  darkly  from  the  hill,  as  the  first  light  of  dawn  came \\ndimly  in  the  sky.  Their  enemies  were  routed  and  did  not \\nreturn. \\n\\n‘What  did  I  tell  you,  Mr.  Pippin?’  said  Sam,  sheathing  his \\nsword.  ‘Wolves  won’t  get  him.  That  was  an  eye-opener,  and \\nno  mistake!  Nearly  singed  the  hair  off  my  head!’ \\n\\nWhen  the  full  light  of  the  morning  came  no  signs  of \\nthe  wolves  were  to  be  found,  and  they  looked  in  vain  for  the \\nbodies  of  the  dead.  No  trace  of  the  fight  remained  but  the \\ncharred  trees  and  the  arrows  of  Legolas  lying  on  the  hill -top. \\nAll  were  undamaged  save  one  of  which  only  the  point  was \\nleft. \\n\\n‘It  is  as  I  feared,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘These  were  no  ordinary \\nwolves  hunting  for  food  in  the  wilderness.  Let  us  eat  quickly \\nand  go!’ \\n\\nThat  day  the  weather  changed  again,  almost  as  if  it  was \\nat  the  command  of  some  power  that  had  no  longer  any  use \\nfor  snow,  since  they  had  retreated  from  the  pass,  a  power \\nthat  wished  now  to  have  a  clear  light  in  which  things  that \\nmoved  in  the  wild  could  be  seen  from  far  away.  The  wind \\nhad  been  turning  through  north  to  north-west  during  the \\nnight,  and  now  it  failed.  The  clouds  vanished  southwards \\nand  the  sky  was  opened,  high  and  blue.  As  they  stood  upon \\nthe  hillside,  ready  to  depart,  a  pale  sunlight  gleamed  over  the \\nmountain-tops. \\n\\n‘We  must  reach  the  doors  before  sunset,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘or \\nI  fear  we  shall  not  reach  them  at  all.  It  is  not  far,  but  our  path \\nmay  be  winding,  for  here  Aragorn  cannot  guide  us;  he  has \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK  391 \\n\\nseldom  walked  in  this  country,  and  only  once  have  I  been \\nunder  the  west  wall  of  Moria,  and  that  was  long  ago. \\n\\n‘There  it  lies,’  he  said,  pointing  away  south-eastwards  to \\nwhere  the  mountains’  sides  fell  sheer  into  the  shadows  at  their \\nfeet.  In  the  distance  could  be  dimly  seen  a  line  of  bare  cliffs, \\nand  in  their  midst,  taller  than  the  rest,  one  great  grey  wall. \\n‘When  we  left  the  pass  I  led  you  southwards,  and  not  back \\nto  our  starting  point,  as  some  of  you  may  have  noticed.  It  is \\nwell  that  I  did  so,  for  now  we  have  several  miles  less  to  cross, \\nand  haste  is  needed.  Let  us  go!’ \\n\\n‘I  do  not  know  which  to  hope,’  said  Boromir  grimly:  ‘that \\nGandalf  will  find  what  he  seeks,  or  that  coming  to  the  cliff \\nwe  shall  find  the  gates  lost  for  ever.  All  choices  seem  ill,  and \\nto  be  caught  between  wolves  and  the  wall  the  likeliest  chance. \\nLead  on!’ \\n\\nGimli  now  walked  ahead  by  the  wizard’s  side,  so  eager  was \\nhe  to  come  to  Moria.  Together  they  led  the  Company  back \\ntowards  the  mountains.  The  only  road  of  old  to  Moria  from \\nthe  west  had  lain  along  the  course  of  a  stream,  the  Shannon, \\nthat  ran  out  from  the  feet  of  the  cliffs  near  where  the  doors \\nhad  stood.  But  either  Gandalf  was  astray,  or  else  the  land \\nhad  changed  in  recent  years;  for  he  did  not  strike  the  stream \\nwhere  he  looked  to  find  it,  only  a  few  miles  southwards  from \\ntheir  start. \\n\\nThe  morning  was  passing  towards  noon,  and  still  the  Com¬ \\npany  wandered  and  scrambled  in  a  barren  country  of  red \\nstones.  Nowhere  could  they  see  any  gleam  of  water  or  hear \\nany  sound  of  it.  All  was  bleak  and  dry.  Their  hearts  sank. \\nThey  saw  no  living  thing,  and  not  a  bird  was  in  the  sky;  but \\nwhat  the  night  would  bring,  if  it  caught  them  in  that  lost  land, \\nnone  of  them  cared  to  think. \\n\\nSuddenly  Gimli,  who  had  pressed  on  ahead,  called  back  to \\nthem.  He  was  standing  on  a  knoll  and  pointing  to  the  right. \\nHurrying  up  they  saw  below  them  a  deep  and  narrow  chan¬ \\nnel.  It  was  empty  and  silent,  and  hardly  a  trickle  of  water \\nflowed  among  the  brown  and  red-stained  stones  of  its  bed; \\n\\n\\n392 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nbut  on  the  near  side  there  was  a  path,  much  broken  and \\ndecayed,  that  wound  its  way  among  the  ruined  walls  and \\npaving-stones  of  an  ancient  highroad. \\n\\n‘Ah!  Here  it  is  at  last!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘This  is  where  the \\nstream  ran:  Sirannon,  the  Gate-stream,  they  used  to  call  it. \\nBut  what  has  happened  to  the  water,  I  cannot  guess;  it  used \\nto  be  swift  and  noisy.  Come!  We  must  hurry  on.  We  are  late.’ \\n\\nThe  Company  were  footsore  and  tired;  but  they  trudged \\ndoggedly  along  the  rough  and  winding  track  for  many  miles. \\nThe  sun  turned  from  the  noon  and  began  to  go  west.  After \\na  brief  halt  and  a  hasty  meal  they  went  on  again.  Before  them \\nthe  mountains  frowned,  but  their  path  lay  in  a  deep  trough \\nof  land  and  they  could  see  only  the  higher  shoulders  and  the \\nfar  eastward  peaks. \\n\\nAt  length  they  came  to  a  sharp  bend.  There  the  road, \\nwhich  had  been  veering  southwards  between  the  brink  of  the \\nchannel  and  a  steep  fall  of  the  land  to  the  left,  turned  and \\nwent  due  east  again.  Rounding  the  corner  they  saw  before \\nthem  a  low  cliff,  some  five  fathoms  high,  with  a  broken  and \\njagged  top.  Over  it  a  trickling  water  dripped,  through  a  wide \\ncleft  that  seemed  to  have  been  carved  out  by  a  fall  that  had \\nonce  been  strong  and  full. \\n\\n‘Indeed  things  have  changed!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘But  there  is \\nno  mistaking  the  place.  There  is  all  that  remains  of  the  Stair \\nFalls.  If  I  remember  right,  there  was  a  flight  of  steps  cut  in \\nthe  rock  at  their  side,  but  the  main  road  wound  away  left  and \\nclimbed  with  several  loops  up  to  the  level  ground  at  the  top. \\nThere  used  to  be  a  shallow  valley  beyond  the  falls  right  up \\nto  the  Walls  of  Moria,  and  the  Sirannon  flowed  through  it \\nwith  the  road  beside  it.  Let  us  go  and  see  what  things  are  like \\nnow!’ \\n\\nThey  found  the  stone  steps  without  difficulty,  and  Gimli \\nsprang  swiftly  up  them,  followed  by  Gandalf  and  Frodo. \\nWhen  they  reached  the  top  they  saw  that  they  could  go  no \\nfurther  that  way,  and  the  reason  for  the  drying  up  of  the \\nGate-stream  was  revealed.  Behind  them  the  sinking  Sun  filled \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n393 \\n\\n\\nthe  cool  western  sky  with  glimmering  gold.  Before  them \\nstretched  a  dark  still  lake.  Neither  sky  nor  sunset  was  reflected \\non  its  sullen  surface.  The  Shannon  had  been  dammed  and \\nhad  filled  all  the  valley.  Beyond  the  ominous  water  were \\nreared  vast  cliffs,  their  stern  faces  pallid  in  the  fading  light: \\nfinal  and  impassable.  No  sign  of  gate  or  entrance,  not  a  fissure \\nor  crack  could  Frodo  see  in  the  frowning  stone. \\n\\n‘There  are  the  Walls  of  Moria,’  said  Gandalf,  pointing \\nacross  the  water.  ‘And  there  the  Gate  stood  once  upon  a \\ntime,  the  Elven  Door  at  the  end  of  the  road  from  Hollin  by \\nwhich  we  have  come.  But  this  way  is  blocked.  None  of  the \\nCompany,  I  guess,  will  wish  to  swim  this  gloomy  water  at  the \\nend  of  the  day.  It  has  an  unwholesome  look.’ \\n\\n‘We  must  find  a  way  round  the  northern  edge,’  said  Gimli. \\n‘The  first  thing  for  the  Company  to  do  is  to  climb  up  by  the \\nmain  path  and  see  where  that  will  lead  us.  Even  if  there  were \\nno  lake,  we  could  not  get  our  baggage -pony  up  this  stair.’ \\n\\n‘But  in  any  case  we  cannot  take  the  poor  beast  into  the \\nMines,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘The  road  under  the  mountains  is  a \\ndark  road,  and  there  are  places  narrow  and  steep  which  he \\ncannot  tread,  even  if  we  can.’ \\n\\n‘Poor  old  Bill!’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  had  not  thought  of  that.  And \\npoor  Sam!  I  wonder  what  he  will  say?’ \\n\\n‘I  am  sorry,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Poor  Bill  has  been  a  useful \\ncompanion,  and  it  goes  to  my  heart  to  turn  him  adrift  now. \\nI  would  have  travelled  lighter  and  brought  no  animal,  least  of \\nall  this  one  that  Sam  is  fond  of,  if  I  had  had  my  way.  I  feared \\nall  along  that  we  should  be  obliged  to  take  this  road.’ \\n\\nThe  day  was  drawing  to  its  end,  and  cold  stars  were  glinting \\nin  the  sky  high  above  the  sunset,  when  the  Company,  with \\nall  the  speed  they  could,  climbed  up  the  slopes  and  reached \\nthe  side  of  the  lake.  In  breadth  it  looked  to  be  no  more  than \\ntwo  or  three  furlongs  at  the  widest  point.  How  far  it  stretched \\naway  southward  they  could  not  see  in  the  failing  light;  but  its \\nnorthern  end  was  no  more  than  half  a  mile  from  where  they \\nstood,  and  between  the  stony  ridges  that  enclosed  the  valley \\n\\n\\n394  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nand  the  water’s  edge  there  was  a  rim  of  open  ground.  They \\nhurried  forward,  for  they  had  still  a  mile  or  two  to  go  before \\nthey  could  reach  the  point  on  the  far  shore  that  Gandalf  was \\nmaking  for;  and  then  he  had  still  to  find  the  doors. \\n\\nWhen  they  came  to  the  northernmost  corner  of  the  lake \\nthey  found  a  narrow  creek  that  barred  their  way.  It  was  green \\nand  stagnant,  thrust  out  like  a  slimy  arm  towards  the  enclos¬ \\ning  hills.  Gimli  strode  forward  undeterred,  and  found  that \\nthe  water  was  shallow,  no  more  than  ankle-deep  at  the  edge. \\nBehind  him  they  walked  in  file,  threading  their  way  with  care, \\nfor  under  the  weedy  pools  were  sliding  and  greasy  stones, \\nand  footing  was  treacherous.  Frodo  shuddered  with  disgust \\nat  the  touch  of  the  dark  unclean  water  on  his  feet. \\n\\nAs  Sam,  the  last  of  the  Company,  led  Bill  up  on  to  the  dry \\nground  on  the  far  side,  there  came  a  soft  sound:  a  swish, \\nfollowed  by  a  plop,  as  if  a  fish  had  disturbed  the  still  surface \\nof  the  water.  Turning  quickly  they  saw  ripples,  black-edged \\nwith  shadow  in  the  waning  light:  great  rings  were  widening \\noutwards  from  a  point  far  out  in  the  lake.  There  was  a  bub¬ \\nbling  noise,  and  then  silence.  The  dusk  deepened,  and  the \\nlast  gleams  of  the  sunset  were  veiled  in  cloud. \\n\\nGandalf  now  pressed  on  at  a  great  pace,  and  the  others \\nfollowed  as  quickly  as  they  could.  They  reached  the  strip  of \\ndry  land  between  the  lake  and  the  cliffs:  it  was  narrow,  often \\nhardly  a  dozen  yards  across,  and  encumbered  with  fallen  rock \\nand  stones;  but  they  found  a  way,  hugging  the  cliff,  and \\nkeeping  as  far  from  the  dark  water  as  they  might.  A  mile \\nsouthwards  along  the  shore  they  came  upon  holly  trees. \\nStumps  and  dead  boughs  were  rotting  in  the  shallows,  the \\nremains  it  seemed  of  old  thickets,  or  of  a  hedge  that  had  once \\nlined  the  road  across  the  drowned  valley.  But  close  under  the \\ncliff  there  stood,  still  strong  and  living,  two  tall  trees,  larger \\nthan  any  trees  of  holly  that  Frodo  had  ever  seen  or  imagined. \\nTheir  great  roots  spread  from  the  wall  to  the  water.  Under \\nthe  looming  cliffs  they  had  looked  like  mere  bushes,  when \\nseen  far  off  from  the  top  of  the  Stair;  but  now  they  towered \\noverhead,  stiff,  dark,  and  silent,  throwing  deep  night-shadows \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK  395 \\n\\nabout  their  feet,  standing  like  sentinel  pillars  at  the  end  of  the \\nroad. \\n\\n‘Well,  here  we  are  at  last!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Here  the  Elven- \\nway  from  Hollin  ended.  Holly  was  the  token  of  the  people  of \\nthat  land,  and  they  planted  it  here  to  mark  the  end  of  their \\ndomain;  for  the  West-door  was  made  chiefly  for  their  use  in \\ntheir  traffic  with  the  Lords  of  Moria.  Those  were  happier \\ndays,  when  there  was  still  close  friendship  at  times  between \\nfolk  of  different  race,  even  between  Dwarves  and  Elves.’ \\n\\n‘It  was  not  the  fault  of  the  Dwarves  that  the  friendship \\nwaned,’  said  Gimli. \\n\\n‘I  have  not  heard  that  it  was  the  fault  of  the  Elves,’  said \\nLegolas. \\n\\n‘I  have  heard  both,’  said  Gandalf;  ‘and  I  will  not  give \\njudgement  now.  But  I  beg  you  two,  Legolas  and  Gimli,  at \\nleast  to  be  friends,  and  to  help  me.  I  need  you  both.  The \\ndoors  are  shut  and  hidden,  and  the  sooner  we  find  them  the \\nbetter.  Night  is  at  hand!’ \\n\\nTurning  to  the  others  he  said:  While  I  am  searching,  will \\nyou  each  make  ready  to  enter  the  Mines?  For  here  I  fear  we \\nmust  say  farewell  to  our  good  beast  of  burden.  You  must  lay \\naside  much  of  the  stuff  that  we  brought  against  bitter  weather: \\nyou  will  not  need  it  inside,  nor,  I  hope,  when  we  come \\nthrough  and  journey  on  down  into  the  South.  Instead  each \\nof  us  must  take  a  share  of  what  the  pony  carried,  especially \\nthe  food  and  the  water-skins.’ \\n\\n‘But  you  can’t  leave  poor  old  Bill  behind  in  this  forsaken \\nplace,  Mr.  Gandalf!’  cried  Sam,  angry  and  distressed.  ‘I \\nwon’t  have  it,  and  that’s  flat.  After  he  has  come  so  far  and \\nall!’ \\n\\n‘I  am  sorry,  Sam,’  said  the  wizard.  ‘But  when  the  Door \\nopens  I  do  not  think  you  will  be  able  to  drag  your  Bill  inside, \\ninto  the  long  dark  of  Moria.  You  will  have  to  choose  between \\nBill  and  your  master.’ \\n\\n‘He’d  follow  Mr.  Frodo  into  a  dragon’s  den,  if  I  led  him,’ \\nprotested  Sam.  ‘It’d  be  nothing  short  of  murder  to  turn  him \\nloose  with  all  these  wolves  about.’ \\n\\n\\n396 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘It  will  be  short  of  murder,  I  hope,’  said  Gandalf.  He  laid \\nhis  hand  on  the  pony’s  head,  and  spoke  in  a  low  voice.  ‘Go \\nwith  words  of  guard  and  guiding  on  you,’  he  said.  ‘You  are \\na  wise  beast,  and  have  learned  much  in  Rivendell.  Make  your \\nways  to  places  where  you  can  find  grass,  and  so  come  in  time \\nto  Elrond’s  house,  or  wherever  you  wish  to  go. \\n\\n‘There,  Sam!  He  will  have  quite  as  much  chance  of  escap¬ \\ning  wolves  and  getting  home  as  we  have.’ \\n\\nSam  stood  sullenly  by  the  pony  and  returned  no  answer. \\nBill,  seeming  to  understand  well  what  was  going  on,  nuzzled \\nup  to  him,  putting  his  nose  to  Sam’s  ear.  Sam  burst  into \\ntears,  and  fumbled  with  the  straps,  unlading  all  the  pony’s \\npacks  and  throwing  them  on  the  ground.  The  others  sorted \\nout  the  goods,  making  a  pile  of  all  that  could  be  left  behind, \\nand  dividing  up  the  rest. \\n\\nWhen  this  was  done  they  turned  to  watch  Gandalf.  He \\nappeared  to  have  done  nothing.  He  was  standing  between \\nthe  two  trees  gazing  at  the  blank  wall  of  the  cliff,  as  if  he \\nwould  bore  a  hole  into  it  with  his  eyes.  Gimli  was  wandering \\nabout,  tapping  the  stone  here  and  there  with  his  axe.  Legolas \\nwas  pressed  against  the  rock,  as  if  listening. \\n\\n‘Well,  here  we  are  and  all  ready,’  said  Merry;  ‘but  where \\nare  the  Doors?  I  can’t  see  any  sign  of  them.’ \\n\\n‘Dwarf-doors  are  not  made  to  be  seen  when  shut,’  said \\nGimli.  ‘They  are  invisible,  and  their  own  makers  cannot  find \\nthem  or  open  them,  if  their  secret  is  forgotten.’ \\n\\n‘But  this  Door  was  not  made  to  be  a  secret  known  only  to \\nDwarves,’  said  Gandalf,  coming  suddenly  to  life  and  turning \\nround.  ‘Unless  things  are  altogether  changed,  eyes  that  know \\nwhat  to  look  for  may  discover  the  signs.’ \\n\\nHe  walked  forward  to  the  wall.  Right  between  the  shadow \\nof  the  trees  there  was  a  smooth  space,  and  over  this  he  passed \\nhis  hands  to  and  fro,  muttering  words  under  his  breath.  Then \\nhe  stepped  back. \\n\\n‘Look!’  he  said.  ‘Can  you  see  anything  now?’ \\n\\nThe  Moon  now  shone  upon  the  grey  face  of  the  rock;  but \\nthey  could  see  nothing  else  for  a  while.  Then  slowly  on  the \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n397 \\n\\n\\nsurface,  where  the  wizard’s  hands  had  passed,  faint  lines \\nappeared,  like  slender  veins  of  silver  running  in  the  stone.  At \\nfirst  they  were  no  more  than  pale  gossamer-threads,  so  fine \\nthat  they  only  twinkled  fitfully  where  the  Moon  caught  them, \\nbut  steadily  they  grew  broader  and  clearer,  until  their  design \\ncould  be  guessed. \\n\\nAt  the  top,  as  high  as  Gandalf  could  reach,  was  an  arch  of \\ninterlacing  letters  in  an  Elvish  character.  Below,  though  the \\nthreads  were  in  places  blurred  or  broken,  the  outline  could \\nbe  seen  of  an  anvil  and  a  hammer  surmounted  by  a  crown \\nwith  seven  stars.  Beneath  these  again  were  two  trees,  each \\nbearing  crescent  moons.  More  clearly  than  all  else  there  shone \\nforth  in  the  middle  of  the  door  a  single  star  with  many  rays. \\n\\n‘There  are  the  emblems  of  Dunn!’  cried  Gimli. \\n\\n‘And  there  is  the  Tree  of  the  High  Elves!’  said  Legolas. \\n\\n‘And  the  Star  of  the  House  of  Feanor,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘They \\nare  wrought  of  ithildin  that  mirrors  only  starlight  and  moon¬ \\nlight,  and  sleeps  until  it  is  touched  by  one  who  speaks  words \\nnow  long  forgotten  in  Middle-earth.  It  is  long  since  I  heard \\nthem,  and  I  thought  deeply  before  I  could  recall  them  to  my \\nmind.’ \\n\\n‘What  does  the  writing  say?’  asked  Frodo,  who  was  trying \\nto  decipher  the  inscription  on  the  arch.  ‘I  thought  I  knew  the \\nelf-letters,  but  I  cannot  read  these.’ \\n\\n‘The  words  are  in  the  elven-tongue  of  the  West  of  Middle- \\nearth  in  the  Elder  Days,’  answered  Gandalf.  ‘But  they  do  not \\nsay  anything  of  importance  to  us.

In  the  days  of  Durin  they  were  not \\nsecret.  They  usually  stood  open  and  doorwards  sat  here.  But \\nif  they  were  shut,  any  who  knew  the  opening  word  could \\nspeak  it  and  pass  in.  At  least  so  it  is  recorded,  is  it  not,  Gimli?’ \\n\\n‘It  is,’  said  the  dwarf.  ‘But  what  the  word  was  is  not \\nremembered.  Narvi  and  his  craft  and  all  his  kindred  have \\nvanished  from  the  earth.’ \\n\\n‘But  do  not  you  know  the  word,  Gandalf?’  asked  Boromir \\nin  surprise. \\n\\n‘No!’  said  the  wizard. \\n\\nThe  others  looked  dismayed;  only  Aragorn,  who  knew \\nGandalf  well,  remained  silent  and  unmoved. \\n\\n‘Then  what  was  the  use  of  bringing  us  to  this  accursed \\nspot?’  cried  Boromir,  glancing  back  with  a  shudder  at  the \\ndark  water.  ‘You  told  us  that  you  had  once  passed  through \\nthe  Mines.  How  could  that  be,  if  you  did  not  know  how  to \\nenter?’ \\n\\n‘The  answer  to  your  first  question,  Boromir,’  said  the  wiz¬ \\nard,  ‘is  that  I  do  not  know  the  word  -  yet.  But  we  shall  soon \\nsee.  And,’  he  added,  with  a  glint  in  his  eyes  under  their \\nbristling  brows,  ‘you  may  ask  what  is  the  use  of  my  deeds \\nwhen  they  are  proved  useless.  As  for  your  other  question:  do \\nyou  doubt  my  tale?  Or  have  you  no  wits  left?  I  did  not  enter \\nthis  way.  I  came  from  the  East. \\n\\n‘If  you  wish  to  know,  I  will  tell  you  that  these  doors  open \\noutwards.  From  the  inside  you  may  thrust  them  open  with \\nyour  hands.  From  the  outside  nothing  will  move  them  save \\nthe  spell  of  command.  They  cannot  be  forced  inwards.’ \\n\\n‘What  are  you  going  to  do  then?’  asked  Pippin,  undaunted \\nby  the  wizard’s  bristling  brows. \\n\\n‘Knock  on  the  doors  with  your  head,  Peregrin  Took,’  said \\nGandalf.  ‘But  if  that  does  not  shatter  them,  and  I  am  allowed \\na  little  peace  from  foolish  questions,  I  will  seek  for  the  opening \\nwords. \\n\\n‘I  once  knew  every  spell  in  all  the  tongues  of  Elves  or  Men \\n\\n\\n400  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nor  Ores,  that  was  ever  used  for  such  a  purpose.  I  can  still \\nremember  ten  score  of  them  without  searching  in  my  mind. \\nBut  only  a  few  trials,  I  think,  will  be  needed;  and  I  shall  not \\nhave  to  call  on  Gimli  for  words  of  the  secret  dwarf-tongue \\nthat  they  teach  to  none.  The  opening  words  were  Elvish,  like \\nthe  writing  on  the  arch:  that  seems  certain.’ \\n\\nHe  stepped  up  to  the  rock  again,  and  lightly  touched  with \\nhis  staff  the  silver  star  in  the  middle  beneath  the  sign  of  the \\nanvil. \\n\\n\\nAnnon  edhellen,  edro  hi  ammen! \\n\\nFennas  nogothrim,  lasto  heth  lammen! \\n\\nhe  said  in  a  commanding  voice.  The  silver  lines  faded,  but \\nthe  blank  grey  stone  did  not  stir. \\n\\nMany  times  he  repeated  these  words  in  different  order,  or \\nvaried  them.  Then  he  tried  other  spells,  one  after  another, \\nspeaking  now  faster  and  louder,  now  soft  and  slow.  Then \\nhe  spoke  many  single  words  of  Elvish  speech.  Nothing  hap¬ \\npened.  The  cliff  towered  into  the  night,  the  countless  stars \\nwere  kindled,  the  wind  blew  cold,  and  the  doors  stood  fast. \\n\\nAgain  Gandalf  approached  the  wall,  and  lifting  up  his  arms \\nhe  spoke  in  tones  of  command  and  rising  wrath.  Edro,  edro! \\nhe  cried,  and  struck  the  rock  with  his  staff.  Open,  open!  he \\nshouted,  and  followed  it  with  the  same  command  in  every \\nlanguage  that  had  ever  been  spoken  in  the  West  of  Middle- \\nearth.  Then  he  threw  his  staff  on  the  ground,  and  sat  down \\nin  silence. \\n\\nAt  that  moment  from  far  off  the  wind  bore  to  their  listening \\nears  the  howling  of  wolves.  Bill  the  pony  started  in  fear,  and \\nSam  sprang  to  his  side  and  whispered  softly  to  him. \\n\\n‘Do  not  let  him  run  away!’  said  Boromir.  ‘It  seems  that  we \\nshall  need  him  still,  if  the  wolves  do  not  find  us.  How  I  hate \\nthis  foul  pool!’  He  stooped  and  picking  up  a  large  stone  he \\ncast  it  far  into  the  dark  water. \\n\\nThe  stone  vanished  with  a  soft  slap;  but  at  the  same  instant \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n401 \\n\\n\\nthere  was  a  swish  and  a  bubble.  Great  rippling  rings  formed \\non  the  surface  out  beyond  where  the  stone  had  fallen,  and \\nthey  moved  slowly  towards  the  foot  of  the  cliff. \\n\\n‘Why  did  you  do  that,  Boromir?’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  hate  this \\nplace,  too,  and  I  am  afraid.  I  don’t  know  of  what:  not  of \\nwolves,  or  the  dark  behind  the  doors,  but  of  something  else. \\nI  am  afraid  of  the  pool.  Don’t  disturb  it!’ \\n\\n‘I  wish  we  could  get  away!’  said  Merry. \\n\\nWhy  doesn’t  Gandalf  do  something  quick?’  said  Pippin. \\n\\nGandalf  took  no  notice  of  them.  He  sat  with  his  head \\nbowed,  either  in  despair  or  in  anxious  thought.  The  mournful \\nhowling  of  the  wolves  was  heard  again.  The  ripples  on  the \\nwater  grew  and  came  closer;  some  were  already  lapping  on \\nthe  shore. \\n\\nWith  a  suddenness  that  startled  them  all  the  wizard  sprang \\nto  his  feet.  He  was  laughing!  ‘I  have  it!’  he  cried.  ‘Of  course, \\nof  course!  Absurdly  simple,  like  most  riddles  when  you  see \\nthe  answer.’ \\n\\nPicking  up  his  staff  he  stood  before  the  rock  and  said  in  a \\nclear  voice:  Mellon! \\n\\nThe  star  shone  out  briefly  and  faded  again.  Then  silently \\na  great  doorway  was  outlined,  though  not  a  crack  or  joint  had \\nbeen  visible  before.  Slowly  it  divided  in  the  middle  and  swung \\noutwards  inch  by  inch,  until  both  doors  lay  back  against  the \\nwall.  Through  the  opening  a  shadowy  stair  could  be  seen \\nclimbing  steeply  up;  but  beyond  the  lower  steps  the  darkness \\nwas  deeper  than  the  night.  The  Company  stared  in  wonder. \\n\\n‘I  was  wrong  after  all,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘and  Gimli  too.  Merry, \\nof  all  people,  was  on  the  right  track.  The  opening  word  was \\ninscribed  on  the  archway  all  the  time!  The  translation  should \\nhave  been:  Say  “Friend”  and  enter.  I  had  only  to  speak  the \\nElvish  word  for  friend  and  the  doors  opened.  Quite  simple. \\nToo  simple  for  a  learned  lore-master  in  these  suspicious  days. \\nThose  were  happier  times.  Now  let  us  go!’ \\n\\nHe  strode  forward  and  set  his  foot  on  the  lowest  step. \\nBut  at  that  moment  several  things  happened.  Frodo  felt \\n\\n\\n402  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nsomething  seize  him  by  the  ankle,  and  he  fell  with  a  cry.  Bill \\nthe  pony  gave  a  wild  neigh  of  fear,  and  turned  tail  and  dashed \\naway  along  the  lakeside  into  the  darkness.  Sam  leaped  after \\nhim,  and  then  hearing  Frodo’s  cry  he  ran  back  again,  weeping \\nand  cursing.  The  others  swung  round  and  saw  the  waters  of \\nthe  lake  seething,  as  if  a  host  of  snakes  were  swimming  up \\nfrom  the  southern  end. \\n\\nOut  from  the  water  a  long  sinuous  tentacle  had  crawled;  it \\nwas  pale-green  and  luminous  and  wet.  Its  fingered  end  had \\nhold  of  Frodo’s  foot,  and  was  dragging  him  into  the  water. \\nSam  on  his  knees  was  now  slashing  at  it  with  a  knife. \\n\\nThe  arm  let  go  of  Frodo,  and  Sam  pulled  him  away,  crying \\nout  for  help.  Twenty  other  arms  came  rippling  out.  The  dark \\nwater  boiled,  and  there  was  a  hideous  stench. \\n\\n‘Into  the  gateway!  Up  the  stairs!  Quick!’  shouted  Gandalf \\nleaping  back.  Rousing  them  from  the  horror  that  seemed  to \\nhave  rooted  all  but  Sam  to  the  ground  where  they  stood,  he \\ndrove  them  forward. \\n\\nThey  were  just  in  time.  Sam  and  Frodo  were  only  a  few \\nsteps  up,  and  Gandalf  had  just  begun  to  climb,  when  the \\ngroping  tentacles  writhed  across  the  narrow  shore  and  fin¬ \\ngered  the  cliff-wall  and  the  doors.  One  came  wriggling  over \\nthe  threshold,  glistening  in  the  starlight.  Gandalf  turned  and \\npaused.  If  he  was  considering  what  word  would  close  the \\ngate  again  from  within,  there  was  no  need.  Many  coiling  arms \\nseized  the  doors  on  either  side,  and  with  horrible  strength, \\nswung  them  round.  With  a  shattering  echo  they  slammed, \\nand  all  light  was  lost.  A  noise  of  rending  and  crashing  came \\ndully  through  the  ponderous  stone. \\n\\nSam,  clinging  to  Frodo’s  arm,  collapsed  on  a  step  in  the  black \\ndarkness.  ‘Poor  old  Bill!’  he  said  in  a  choking  voice.  ‘Poor  old \\nBill!  Wolves  and  snakes!  But  the  snakes  were  too  much  for  him. \\nI  had  to  choose,  Mr.  Frodo.  I  had  to  come  with  you.’ \\n\\nThey  heard  Gandalf  go  back  down  the  steps  and  thrust  his \\nstaff  against  the  doors.  There  was  a  quiver  in  the  stone  and \\nthe  stairs  trembled,  but  the  doors  did  not  open. \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n403 \\n\\n\\n‘Well,  well!’  said  the  wizard.  ‘The  passage  is  blocked \\nbehind  us  now,  and  there  is  only  one  way  out  -  on  the  other \\nside  of  the  mountains.  I  fear  from  the  sounds  that  boulders \\nhave  been  piled  up,  and  the  trees  uprooted  and  thrown  across \\nthe  gate.  I  am  sorry;  for  the  trees  were  beautiful,  and  had \\nstood  so  long.’ \\n\\n‘I  felt  that  something  horrible  was  near  from  the  moment \\nthat  my  foot  first  touched  the  water,’  said  Frodo.  ‘What  was \\nthe  thing,  or  were  there  many  of  them?’ \\n\\n‘I  do  not  know,’  answered  Gandalf;  ‘but  the  arms  were  all \\nguided  by  one  purpose.  Something  has  crept,  or  has  been \\ndriven  out  of  dark  waters  under  the  mountains.  There  are \\nolder  and  fouler  things  than  Ores  in  the  deep  places  of  the \\nworld.’  He  did  not  speak  aloud  his  thought  that  whatever  it \\nwas  that  dwelt  in  the  lake,  it  had  seized  on  Frodo  first  among \\nall  the  Company. \\n\\nBoromir  muttered  under  his  breath,  but  the  echoing  stone \\nmagnified  the  sound  to  a  hoarse  whisper  that  all  could  hear: \\n‘In  the  deep  places  of  the  world!  And  thither  we  are  going \\nagainst  my  wish.  Who  will  lead  us  now  in  this  deadly  dark?’ \\n\\n‘I  will,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘and  Gimli  shall  walk  with  me.  Follow \\nmy  staff!’ \\n\\nAs  the  wizard  passed  on  ahead  up  the  great  steps,  he  held \\nhis  staff  aloft,  and  from  its  tip  there  came  a  faint  radiance. \\nThe  wide  stairway  was  sound  and  undamaged.  Two  hundred \\nsteps  they  counted,  broad  and  shallow;  and  at  the  top  they \\nfound  an  arched  passage  with  a  level  floor  leading  on  into  the \\ndark. \\n\\n‘Let  us  sit  and  rest  and  have  something  to  eat,  here  on  the \\nlanding,  since  we  can’t  find  a  dining-room!’  said  Frodo.  He \\nhad  begun  to  shake  off  the  terror  of  the  clutching  arm,  and \\nsuddenly  he  felt  extremely  hungry. \\n\\nThe  proposal  was  welcomed  by  all;  and  they  sat  down  on \\nthe  upper  steps,  dim  figures  in  the  gloom.  After  they  had \\neaten,  Gandalf  gave  them  each  a  third  sip  of  the  miruvor  of \\nRivendell. \\n\\n\\n404 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘It  will  not  last  much  longer,  I  am  afraid,’  he  said;  ‘but  I \\nthink  we  need  it  after  that  horror  at  the  gate.  And  unless  we \\nhave  great  luck,  we  shall  need  all  that  is  left  before  we  see  the \\nother  side!  Go  carefully  with  the  water,  too!  There  are  many \\nstreams  and  wells  in  the  Mines,  but  they  should  not  be \\ntouched.  We  may  not  have  a  chance  of  filling  our  skins  and \\nbottles  till  we  come  down  into  Dimrill  Dale.’ \\n\\n‘How  long  is  that  going  to  take  us?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘I  cannot  say,’  answered  Gandalf.  ‘It  depends  on  many \\nchances.  But  going  straight,  without  mishap  or  losing  our \\nway,  we  shall  take  three  or  four  marches,  I  expect.  It  cannot \\nbe  less  than  forty  miles  from  West-door  to  East-gate  in  a \\ndirect  line,  and  the  road  may  wind  much.’ \\n\\nAfter  only  a  brief  rest  they  started  on  their  way  again.  All \\nwere  eager  to  get  the  journey  over  as  quickly  as  possible,  and \\nwere  willing,  tired  as  they  were,  to  go  on  marching  still  for \\nseveral  hours.  Gandalf  walked  in  front  as  before.  In  his  left \\nhand  he  held  up  his  glimmering  staff,  the  light  of  which  just \\nshowed  the  ground  before  his  feet;  in  his  right  he  held  his \\nsword  Glamdring.  Behind  him  came  Gimli,  his  eyes  glinting \\nin  the  dim  light  as  he  turned  his  head  from  side  to  side. \\nBehind  the  dwarf  walked  Frodo,  and  he  had  drawn  the  short \\nsword,  Sting.  No  gleam  came  from  the  blades  of  Sting  or  of \\nGlamdring;  and  that  was  some  comfort,  for  being  the  work \\nof  Elvish  smiths  in  the  Elder  Days  these  swords  shone  with \\na  cold  light,  if  any  Ores  were  near  at  hand.  Behind  Frodo \\nwent  Sam,  and  after  him  Legolas,  and  the  young  hobbits, \\nand  Boromir.  In  the  dark  at  the  rear,  grim  and  silent,  walked \\nAragorn. \\n\\nThe  passage  twisted  round  a  few  turns,  and  then  began  to \\ndescend.  It  went  steadily  down  for  a  long  while  before  it \\nbecame  level  once  again.  The  air  grew  hot  and  stifling,  but  it \\nwas  not  foul,  and  at  times  they  felt  currents  of  cooler  air  upon \\ntheir  faces,  issuing  from  half-guessed  openings  in  the  walls. \\nThere  were  many  of  these.  In  the  pale  ray  of  the  wizard’s \\nstaff,  Frodo  caught  glimpses  of  stairs  and  arches,  and  of  other \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n405 \\n\\n\\npassages  and  tunnels,  sloping  up,  or  running  steeply  down, \\nor  opening  blankly  dark  on  either  side.  It  was  bewildering \\nbeyond  hope  of  remembering. \\n\\nGimli  aided  Gandalf  very  little,  except  by  his  stout  courage. \\nAt  least  he  was  not,  as  were  most  of  the  others,  troubled  by \\nthe  mere  darkness  in  itself.  Often  the  wizard  consulted  him \\nat  points  where  the  choice  of  way  was  doubtful;  but  it  was \\nalways  Gandalf  who  had  the  final  word.  The  Mines  of  Moria \\nwere  vast  and  intricate  beyond  the  imagination  of  Gimli, \\nGloin’s  son,  dwarf  of  the  mountain-race  though  he  was.  To \\nGandalf  the  far-off  memories  of  a  journey  long  before  were \\nnow  of  little  help,  but  even  in  the  gloom  and  despite  all \\nwindings  of  the  road  he  knew  whither  he  wished  to  go,  and \\nhe  did  not  falter,  as  long  as  there  was  a  path  that  led  towards \\nhis  goal. \\n\\n‘Do  not  be  afraid!’  said  Aragorn.  There  was  a  pause  longer \\nthan  usual,  and  Gandalf  and  Gimli  were  whispering  together; \\nthe  others  were  crowded  behind,  waiting  anxiously.  ‘Do  not \\nbe  afraid!  I  have  been  with  him  on  many  a  journey,  if  never \\non  one  so  dark;  and  there  are  tales  in  Rivendell  of  greater \\ndeeds  of  his  than  any  that  I  have  seen.  He  will  not  go  astray \\n-  if  there  is  any  path  to  find.  He  has  led  us  in  here  against \\nour  fears,  but  he  will  lead  us  out  again,  at  whatever  cost  to \\nhimself.  He  is  surer  of  finding  the  way  home  in  a  blind  night \\nthan  the  cats  of  Queen  Beruthiel.’ \\n\\nIt  was  well  for  the  Company  that  they  had  such  a  guide. \\nThey  had  no  fuel  nor  any  means  of  malting  torches;  in  the \\ndesperate  scramble  at  the  doors  many  things  had  been  left \\nbehind.  But  without  any  light  they  would  soon  have  come  to \\ngrief.  There  were  not  only  many  roads  to  choose  from,  there \\nwere  also  in  many  places  holes  and  pitfalls,  and  dark  wells \\nbeside  the  path  in  which  their  passing  feet  echoed.  There \\nwere  fissures  and  chasms  in  the  walls  and  floor,  and  every \\nnow  and  then  a  crack  would  open  right  before  their  feet.  The \\nwidest  was  more  than  seven  feet  across,  and  it  was  long \\nbefore  Pippin  could  summon  enough  courage  to  leap  over \\n\\n\\n406  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nthe  dreadful  gap.  The  noise  of  churning  water  came  up  from \\nfar  below,  as  if  some  great  mill-wheel  was  turning  in  the \\ndepths. \\n\\n‘Rope!’  muttered  Sam.  ‘I  knew  I’d  want  it,  if  I  hadn’t  got  it!’ \\n\\nAs  these  dangers  became  more  frequent  their  march \\nbecame  slower.  Already  they  seemed  to  have  been  tramping \\non,  on,  endlessly  to  the  mountains’  roots.  They  were  more \\nthan  weary,  and  yet  there  seemed  no  comfort  in  the  thought \\nof  halting  anywhere.  Frodo’s  spirits  had  risen  for  a  while  after \\nhis  escape,  and  after  food  and  a  draught  of  the  cordial;  but \\nnow  a  deep  uneasiness,  growing  to  dread,  crept  over  him \\nagain.  Though  he  had  been  healed  in  Rivendell  of  the  knife- \\nstroke,  that  grim  wound  had  not  been  without  effect.  His \\nsenses  were  sharper  and  more  aware  of  things  that  could  not \\nbe  seen.  One  sign  of  change  that  he  soon  had  noticed  was \\nthat  he  could  see  more  in  the  dark  than  any  of  his  com¬ \\npanions,  save  perhaps  Gandalf.  And  he  was  in  any  case  the \\nbearer  of  the  Ring:  it  hung  upon  its  chain  against  his  breast, \\nand  at  whiles  it  seemed  a  heavy  weight.  He  felt  the  certainty \\nof  evil  ahead  and  of  evil  following;  but  he  said  nothing.  He \\ngripped  tighter  on  the  hilt  of  his  sword  and  went  on  doggedly. \\n\\nThe  Company  behind  him  spoke  seldom,  and  then  only  in \\nhurried  whispers.  There  was  no  sound  but  the  sound  of  their \\nown  feet:  the  dull  stump  of  Gimli’s  dwarf-boots;  the  heavy \\ntread  of  Boromir;  the  light  step  of  Legolas;  the  soft,  scarce- \\nheard  patter  of  hobbit-feet;  and  in  the  rear  the  slow  firm \\nfootfalls  of  Aragorn  with  his  long  stride.  When  they  halted \\nfor  a  moment  they  heard  nothing  at  all,  unless  it  were \\noccasionally  a  faint  trickle  and  drip  of  unseen  water.  Yet \\nFrodo  began  to  hear,  or  to  imagine  that  he  heard,  something \\nelse:  like  the  faint  fall  of  soft  bare  feet.  It  was  never  loud \\nenough,  or  near  enough,  for  him  to  feel  certain  that  he  heard \\nit;  but  once  it  had  started  it  never  stopped,  while  the  Company \\nwas  moving.  But  it  was  not  an  echo,  for  when  they  halted  it \\npattered  on  for  a  little  all  by  itself,  and  then  grew  still. \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n407 \\n\\n\\nIt  was  after  nightfall  when  they  had  entered  the  Mines. \\nThey  had  been  going  for  several  hours  with  only  brief  halts, \\nwhen  Gandalf  came  to  his  first  serious  check.  Before  him \\nstood  a  wide  dark  arch  opening  into  three  passages:  all  led  in \\nthe  same  general  direction,  eastwards;  but  the  left-hand  pass¬ \\nage  plunged  down,  while  the  right-hand  climbed  up,  and  the \\nmiddle  way  seemed  to  run  on,  smooth  and  level  but  very \\nnarrow. \\n\\n‘I  have  no  memory  of  this  place  at  all!’  said  Gandalf,  stand¬ \\ning  uncertainly  under  the  arch.  He  held  up  his  staff  in  the \\nhope  of  finding  some  marks  or  inscription  that  might  help \\nhis  choice;  but  nothing  of  the  kind  was  to  be  seen.  ‘I  am  too \\nweary  to  decide,’  he  said,  shaking  his  head.  ‘And  I  expect \\nthat  you  are  all  as  weary  as  I  am,  or  wearier.  We  had  better \\nhalt  here  for  what  is  left  of  the  night.  You  know  what  I  mean! \\nIn  here  it  is  ever  dark;  but  outside  the  late  Moon  is  riding \\nwestward  and  the  middle -night  has  passed.’ \\n\\n‘Poor  old  Bill!’  said  Sam.  ‘I  wonder  where  he  is.  I  hope \\nthose  wolves  haven’t  got  him  yet.  ’ \\n\\nTo  the  left  of  the  great  arch  they  found  a  stone  door:  it \\nwas  half  closed,  but  swung  back  easily  to  a  gentle  thrust. \\nBeyond  there  seemed  to  lie  a  wide  chamber  cut  in  the  rock. \\n\\n‘Steady!  Steady!’  cried  Gandalf,  as  Merry  and  Pippin \\npushed  forward,  glad  to  find  a  place  where  they  could  rest \\nwith  at  least  more  feeling  of  shelter  than  in  the  open  passage. \\n‘Steady!  You  do  not  know  what  is  inside  yet.  I  will  go  first.’ \\n\\nHe  went  in  cautiously,  and  the  others  filed  behind.  ‘There!’ \\nhe  said,  pointing  with  his  staff  to  the  middle  of  the  floor. \\nBefore  his  feet  they  saw  a  large  round  hole  like  the  mouth  of \\na  well.  Broken  and  rusty  chains  lay  at  the  edge  and  trailed \\ndown  into  the  black  pit.  Fragments  of  stone  lay  near. \\n\\n‘One  of  you  might  have  fallen  in  and  still  be  wondering \\nwhen  you  were  going  to  strike  the  bottom,’  said  Aragorn  to \\nMerry.  ‘Let  the  guide  go  first  while  you  have  one.’ \\n\\n‘This  seems  to  have  been  a  guardroom,  made  for  the \\nwatching  of  the  three  passages,’  said  Gimli.  ‘That  hole  was \\nplainly  a  well  for  the  guards’  use,  covered  with  a  stone  lid. \\n\\n\\n408  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nBut  the  lid  is  broken,  and  we  must  all  take  care  in  the  dark.’ \\n\\nPippin  felt  curiously  attracted  by  the  well.  While  the  others \\nwere  unrolling  blankets  and  malting  beds  against  the  walls  of \\nthe  chamber,  as  far  as  possible  from  the  hole  in  the  floor,  he \\ncrept  to  the  edge  and  peered  over.  A  chill  air  seemed  to  strike \\nhis  face,  rising  from  invisible  depths.  Moved  by  a  sudden \\nimpulse  he  groped  for  a  loose  stone,  and  let  it  drop.  He  felt \\nhis  heart  beat  many  times  before  there  was  any  sound.  Then \\nfar  below,  as  if  the  stone  had  fallen  into  deep  water  in  some \\ncavernous  place,  there  came  a  plunk ,  very  distant,  but  magni¬ \\nfied  and  repeated  in  the  hollow  shaft. \\n\\nWhat’s  that?’  cried  Gandalf.  He  was  relieved  when  Pippin \\nconfessed  what  he  had  done;  but  he  was  angry,  and  Pippin \\ncould  see  his  eye  glinting.  ‘Fool  of  a  Took!’  he  growled. \\n‘This  is  a  serious  journey,  not  a  hobbit  walking-party.  Throw \\nyourself  in  next  time,  and  then  you  will  be  no  further  nuis¬ \\nance.  Now  be  quiet!’ \\n\\nNothing  more  was  heard  for  several  minutes;  but  then \\nthere  came  out  of  the  depths  faint  knocks:  tom-tap ,  tap-tom. \\nThey  stopped,  and  when  the  echoes  had  died  away,  they \\nwere  repeated:  tap-tom ,  tom-tap ,  tap-tap,  tom.  They  sounded \\ndisquietingly  like  signals  of  some  sort;  but  after  a  while  the \\nknocking  died  away  and  was  not  heard  again. \\n\\n‘That  was  the  sound  of  a  hammer,  or  I  have  never  heard \\none,’  said  Gimli. \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  Gandalf,  ‘and  I  do  not  like  it.  It  may  have \\nnothing  to  do  with  Peregrin’s  foolish  stone;  but  probably \\nsomething  has  been  disturbed  that  would  have  been  better \\nleft  quiet.  Pray,  do  nothing  of  the  land  again!  Let  us  hope  we \\nshall  get  some  rest  without  further  trouble.  You,  Pippin,  can \\ngo  on  the  first  watch,  as  a  reward,’  he  growled,  as  he  rolled \\nhimself  in  a  blanket. \\n\\nPippin  sat  miserably  by  the  door  in  the  pitch  dark;  but  he \\nkept  on  turning  round,  fearing  that  some  unknown  thing \\nwould  crawl  up  out  of  the  well.  He  wished  he  could  cover \\nthe  hole,  if  only  with  a  blanket,  but  he  dared  not  move  or  go \\nnear  it,  even  though  Gandalf  seemed  to  be  asleep. \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n409 \\n\\n\\nActually  Gandalf  was  awake,  though  lying  still  and  silent. \\nHe  was  deep  in  thought,  trying  to  recall  every  memory  of \\nhis  former  journey  in  the  Mines,  and  considering  anxiously \\nthe  next  course  that  he  should  take;  a  false  turn  now  might \\nbe  disastrous.  After  an  hour  he  rose  up  and  came  over  to \\nPippin. \\n\\n‘Get  into  a  corner  and  have  a  sleep,  my  lad,’  he  said  in  a \\nkindly  tone.  ‘You  want  to  sleep,  I  expect.  I  cannot  get  a  wink, \\nso  I  may  as  well  do  the  watching.’ \\n\\n‘I  know  what  is  the  matter  with  me,’  he  muttered,  as  he  sat \\ndown  by  the  door.  ‘I  need  smoke!  I  have  not  tasted  it  since \\nthe  morning  before  the  snowstorm.’ \\n\\nThe  last  thing  that  Pippin  saw,  as  sleep  took  him,  was  a \\ndark  glimpse  of  the  old  wizard  huddled  on  the  floor,  shielding \\na  glowing  chip  in  his  gnarled  hands  between  his  knees.  The \\nflicker  for  a  moment  showed  his  sharp  nose,  and  the  puff  of \\nsmoke. \\n\\nIt  was  Gandalf  who  roused  them  all  from  sleep.  He  had \\nsat  and  watched  all  alone  for  about  six  hours,  and  had  let  the \\nothers  rest.  ‘And  in  the  watches  I  have  made  up  my  mind,’ \\nhe  said.  ‘I  do  not  like  the  feel  of  the  middle  way;  and  I  do  not \\nlike  the  smell  of  the  left-hand  way:  there  is  foul  air  down \\nthere,  or  I  am  no  guide.  I  shall  take  the  right-hand  passage. \\nIt  is  time  we  began  to  climb  up  again.’ \\n\\nFor  eight  dark  hours,  not  counting  two  brief  halts,  they \\nmarched  on;  and  they  met  no  danger,  and  heard  nothing, \\nand  saw  nothing  but  the  faint  gleam  of  the  wizard’s  light, \\nbobbing  like  a  will-o’-the-wisp  in  front  of  them.  The  passage \\nthey  had  chosen  wound  steadily  upwards.  As  far  as  they \\ncould  judge  it  went  in  great  mounting  curves,  and  as  it  rose \\nit  grew  loftier  and  wider.  There  were  now  no  openings  to \\nother  galleries  or  tunnels  on  either  side,  and  the  floor  was \\nlevel  and  sound,  without  pits  or  cracks.  Evidently  they  had \\nstruck  what  once  had  been  an  important  road;  and  they  went \\nforward  quicker  than  they  had  done  on  their  first  march. \\n\\nIn  this  way  they  advanced  some  fifteen  miles,  measured  in \\n\\n\\n410  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\na  direct  line  east,  though  they  must  have  actually  walked \\ntwenty  miles  or  more.  As  the  road  climbed  upwards,  Frodo’s \\nspirits  rose  a  little;  but  he  still  felt  oppressed,  and  still  at  times \\nhe  heard,  or  thought  he  heard,  away  behind  the  Company \\nand  beyond  the  fall  and  patter  of  their  feet,  a  following  foot¬ \\nstep  that  was  not  an  echo. \\n\\nThey  had  marched  as  far  as  the  hobbits  could  endure \\nwithout  a  rest,  and  all  were  thinking  of  a  place  where  they \\ncould  sleep,  when  suddenly  the  walls  to  right  and  left  van¬ \\nished.  They  seemed  to  have  passed  through  some  arched \\ndoorway  into  a  black  and  empty  space.  There  was  a  great \\ndraught  of  warmer  air  behind  them,  and  before  them  the \\ndarkness  was  cold  on  their  faces.  They  halted  and  crowded \\nanxiously  together. \\n\\nGandalf  seemed  pleased.  ‘I  chose  the  right  way,’  he  said. \\n‘At  last  we  are  coming  to  the  habitable  parts,  and  I  guess  that \\nwe  are  not  far  now  from  the  eastern  side.  But  we  are  high \\nup,  a  good  deal  higher  than  the  Dimrill  Gate,  unless  I  am \\nmistaken.  From  the  feeling  of  the  air  we  must  be  in  a  wide \\nhall.  I  will  now  risk  a  little  real  light.’ \\n\\nHe  raised  his  staff,  and  for  a  brief  instant  there  was  a  blaze \\nlike  a  flash  of  lightning.  Great  shadows  sprang  up  and  fled, \\nand  for  a  second  they  saw  a  vast  roof  far  above  their  heads \\nupheld  by  many  mighty  pillars  hewn  of  stone.  Before  them \\nand  on  either  side  stretched  a  huge  empty  hall;  its  black  walls, \\npolished  and  smooth  as  glass,  flashed  and  glittered.  Three \\nother  entrances  they  saw,  dark  black  arches:  one  straight \\nbefore  them  eastwards,  and  one  on  either  side.  Then  the  light \\nwent  out. \\n\\n‘That  is  all  that  I  shall  venture  on  for  the  present,’  said \\nGandalf.  ‘There  used  to  be  great  windows  on  the  mountain¬ \\nside,  and  shafts  leading  out  to  the  light  in  the  upper  reaches \\nof  the  Mines.  I  think  we  have  reached  them  now,  but  it  is \\nnight  outside  again,  and  we  cannot  tell  until  morning.  If  I \\nam  right,  tomorrow  we  may  actually  see  the  morning  peeping \\nin.  But  in  the  meanwhile  we  had  better  go  no  further.  Let \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK  4II \\n\\nus  rest,  if  we  can.  Things  have  gone  well  so  far,  and  the \\ngreater  part  of  the  dark  road  is  over.  But  we  are  not  through \\nyet,  and  it  is  a  long  way  down  to  the  Gates  that  open  on  the \\nworld.’ \\n\\nThe  Company  spent  that  night  in  the  great  cavernous  hall, \\nhuddled  close  together  in  a  corner  to  escape  the  draught: \\nthere  seemed  to  be  a  steady  inflow  of  chill  air  through  the \\neastern  archway.  All  about  them  as  they  lay  hung  the  dark¬ \\nness,  hollow  and  immense,  and  they  were  oppressed  by  the \\nloneliness  and  vastness  of  the  dolven  halls  and  endlessly \\nbranching  stairs  and  passages.  The  wildest  imaginings  that \\ndark  rumour  had  ever  suggested  to  the  hobbits  fell  altogether \\nshort  of  the  actual  dread  and  wonder  of  Moria. \\n\\n‘There  must  have  been  a  mighty  crowd  of  dwarves  here  at \\none  time,’  said  Sam;  ‘and  every  one  of  them  busier  than \\nbadgers  for  five  hundred  years  to  make  all  this,  and  most  in \\nhard  rock  too!  What  did  they  do  it  all  for?  They  didn’t  live \\nin  these  darksome  holes  surely?’ \\n\\n‘These  are  not  holes,’  said  Gimli.  ‘This  is  the  great  realm \\nand  city  of  the  Dwarrowdelf.  And  of  old  it  was  not  darksome, \\nbut  full  of  light  and  splendour,  as  is  still  remembered  in  our \\nsongs.’ \\n\\nHe  rose  and  standing  in  the  dark  he  began  to  chant  in  a \\ndeep  voice,  while  the  echoes  ran  away  into  the  roof. \\n\\nThe  world  was  young,  the  mountains  green, \\n\\nNo  stain  yet  on  the  Moon  was  seen, \\n\\nNo  words  were  laid  on  stream  or  stone \\nWhen  Durin  woke  and  walked  alone. \\n\\nHe  named  the  nameless  hills  and  dells; \\n\\nHe  drank  from  yet  untasted  wells; \\n\\nHe  stooped  and  looked  in  Mirrormere, \\n\\nAnd  saw  a  crown  of  stars  appear, \\n\\nAs  gems  upon  a  silver  thread, \\n\\nAbove  the  shadow  of  his  head. \\n\\n\\n412 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nThe  world  was  fair,  the  mountains  tall, \\n\\nIn  Elder  Days  before  the  fall \\nOf  mighty  kings  in  Nargothrond \\nAnd  Gondolin,  who  now  beyond \\nThe  Western  Seas  have  passed  away: \\n\\nThe  world  was  fair  in  Durin’s  Day. \\n\\nA  king  he  was  on  carven  throne \\nIn  many-pillared  halls  of  stone \\nWith  golden  roof  and  silver  floor, \\n\\nAnd  runes  of  power  upon  the  door. \\n\\nThe  light  of  sun  and  star  and  moon \\nIn  shining  lamps  of  crystal  hewn \\nUndimmed  by  cloud  or  shade  of  night \\nThere  shone  for  ever  fair  and  bright. \\n\\nThere  hammer  on  the  anvil  smote, \\n\\nThere  chisel  clove,  and  graver  wrote ; \\n\\nThere  forged  was  blade,  and  bound  was  hilt; \\nThe  delver  mined,  the  mason  built. \\n\\nThere  beryl,  pearl,  and  opal  pale, \\n\\nAnd  metal  wrought  like  fishes’  mail, \\n\\nBuckler  and  corslet,  axe  and  sword. \\n\\nAnd  shining  spears  were  laid  in  hoard. \\n\\nUnwearied  then  were  Durin  ’s  folk; \\n\\nBeneath  the  mountains  music  woke: \\n\\nThe  harpers  harped,  the  minstrels  sang, \\n\\nAnd  at  the  gates  the  trumpets  rang. \\n\\nThe  world  is  grey,  the  mountains  old, \\n\\nThe  forge’s  fire  is  ashen-cold; \\n\\nNo  harp  is  wrung,  no  hammer  falls: \\n\\nThe  darkness  dwells  in  Durin’s  halls; \\n\\nThe  shadow  lies  upon  his  tomb \\nIn  Moria,  in  Khazad-dum. \\n\\nBut  still  the  sunken  stars  appear \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n413 \\n\\n\\nIn  dark  and  windless  Mirrormere; \\n\\nThere  lies  his  crown  in  water  deep, \\n\\nTill  Dnrin  wakes  again  from  sleep. \\n\\n‘I  like  that!’  said  Sam.  ‘I  should  like  to  learn  it.  In  Moria, \\nin  Khazad-dum!  But  it  makes  the  darkness  seem  heavier, \\nthinking  of  all  those  lamps.  Are  there  piles  of  jewels  and  gold \\nlying  about  here  still?’ \\n\\nGimli  was  silent.  Having  sung  his  song  he  would  say  no \\nmore. \\n\\n‘Piles  of  jewels?’  said  Gandalf.  ‘No.  The  Ores  have  often \\nplundered  Moria;  there  is  nothing  left  in  the  upper  halls.  And \\nsince  the  dwarves  fled,  no  one  dares  to  seek  the  shafts  and \\ntreasuries  down  in  the  deep  places:  they  are  drowned  in  water \\n-  or  in  a  shadow  of  fear.’ \\n\\n‘Then  what  do  the  dwarves  want  to  come  back  for?’  asked \\nSam. \\n\\n‘For  mithril ,’  answered  Gandalf.  ‘The  wealth  of  Moria  was \\nnot  in  gold  and  jewels,  the  toys  of  the  Dwarves;  nor  in  iron, \\ntheir  servant.  Such  things  they  found  here,  it  is  true,  especially \\niron;  but  they  did  not  need  to  delve  for  them:  all  things  that \\nthey  desired  they  could  obtain  in  traffic.  For  here  alone  in \\nthe  world  was  found  Moria-silver,  or  true-silver  as  some  have \\ncalled  it:  mithril  is  the  Elvish  name.  The  Dwarves  have  a \\nname  which  they  do  not  tell.  Its  worth  was  ten  times  that  of \\ngold,  and  now  it  is  beyond  price;  for  little  is  left  above  ground, \\nand  even  the  Ores  dare  not  delve  here  for  it.  The  lodes  lead \\naway  north  towards  Caradhras,  and  down  to  darkness.  The \\nDwarves  tell  no  tale;  but  even  as  mithril  was  the  foundation \\nof  their  wealth,  so  also  it  was  their  destruction:  they  delved \\ntoo  greedily  and  too  deep,  and  disturbed  that  from  which \\nthey  fled,  Durin’s  Bane.  Of  what  they  brought  to  light  the \\nOres  have  gathered  nearly  all,  and  given  it  in  tribute  to \\nSauron,  who  covets  it. \\n\\n‘ Mithril !  All  folk  desired  it.  It  could  be  beaten  like  copper, \\nand  polished  like  glass;  and  the  Dwarves  could  make  of  it  a \\nmetal,  light  and  yet  harder  than  tempered  steel.  Its  beauty \\n\\n\\n414 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nwas  like  to  that  of  common  silver,  but  the  beauty  of  mithril \\ndid  not  tarnish  or  grow  dim.  The  Elves  dearly  loved  it,  and \\namong  many  uses  they  made  of  it  ithildin ,  starmoon,  which \\nyou  saw  upon  the  doors.  Bilbo  had  a  corslet  of  mithril-rings \\nthat  Thorin  gave  him.  I  wonder  what  has  become  of  it? \\nGathering  dust  still  in  Michel  Delving  Mathom-house,  I \\nsuppose.’ \\n\\n‘What?’  cried  Gimli,  startled  out  of  his  silence.  ‘A  corslet \\nof  Moria-silver?  That  was  a  kingly  gift!’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘I  never  told  him,  but  its  worth  was \\ngreater  than  the  value  of  the  whole  Shire  and  everything  in  it.  ’ \\n\\nFrodo  said  nothing,  but  he  put  his  hand  under  his  tunic \\nand  touched  the  rings  of  his  mail-shirt.  He  felt  staggered  to \\nthink  that  he  had  been  walking  about  with  the  price  of  the \\nShire  under  his  jacket.  Had  Bilbo  known?  He  felt  no  doubt \\nthat  Bilbo  knew  quite  well.  It  was  indeed  a  kingly  gift.  But \\nnow  his  thoughts  had  been  carried  away  from  the  dark  Mines, \\nto  Rivendell,  to  Bilbo,  and  to  Bag  End  in  the  days  while  Bilbo \\nwas  still  there.  He  wished  with  all  his  heart  that  he  was  back \\nthere,  and  in  those  days,  mowing  the  lawn,  or  pottering \\namong  the  flowers,  and  that  he  had  never  heard  of  Moria,  or \\nmithril  -  or  the  Ring. \\n\\nA  deep  silence  fell.  One  by  one  the  others  fell  asleep.  Frodo \\nwas  on  guard.  As  if  it  were  a  breath  that  came  in  through \\nunseen  doors  out  of  deep  places,  dread  came  over  him.  His \\nhands  were  cold  and  his  brow  damp.  He  listened.  All  his \\nmind  was  given  to  listening  and  nothing  else  for  two  slow \\nhours;  but  he  heard  no  sound,  not  even  the  imagined  echo \\nof  a  footfall. \\n\\nHis  watch  was  nearly  over,  when,  far  off  where  he  guessed \\nthat  the  western  archway  stood,  he  fancied  that  he  could  see \\ntwo  pale  points  of  light,  almost  like  luminous  eyes.  He  started. \\nHis  head  had  nodded.  ‘I  must  have  nearly  fallen  asleep  on \\nguard,’  he  thought.  ‘I  was  on  the  edge  of  a  dream.’  He  stood \\nup  and  rubbed  his  eyes,  and  remained  standing,  peering  into \\nthe  dark,  until  he  was  relieved  by  Legolas. \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n415 \\n\\n\\nWhen  he  lay  down  he  quickly  went  to  sleep,  but  it  seemed \\nto  him  that  the  dream  went  on:  he  heard  whispers,  and  saw \\nthe  two  pale  points  of  light  approaching,  slowly.  He  woke \\nand  found  that  the  others  were  speaking  softly  near  him,  and \\nthat  a  dim  light  was  falling  on  his  face.  High  up  above  the \\neastern  archway  through  a  shaft  near  the  roof  came  a  long \\npale  gleam;  and  across  the  hall  through  the  northern  arch \\nlight  also  glimmered  faint  and  distantly. \\n\\nFrodo  sat  up.  ‘Good  morning!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘For  morning \\nit  is  again  at  last.  I  was  right,  you  see.  We  are  high  up  on  the \\neast  side  of  Moria.  Before  today  is  over  we  ought  to  find \\nthe  Great  Gates  and  see  the  waters  of  Mirrormere  lying  in \\nthe  Dimrill  Dale  before  us.’ \\n\\n‘I  shall  be  glad,’  said  Gimli.  ‘I  have  looked  on  Moria,  and \\nit  is  very  great,  but  it  has  become  dark  and  dreadful;  and  we \\nhave  found  no  sign  of  my  kindred.  I  doubt  now  that  Balin \\never  came  here.’ \\n\\nAfter  they  had  breakfasted  Gandalf  decided  to  go  on  again \\nat  once.  We  are  tired,  but  we  shall  rest  better  when  we  are \\noutside,’  he  said.  ‘I  think  that  none  of  us  will  wish  to  spend \\nanother  night  in  Moria.’ \\n\\n‘No  indeed!’  said  Boromir.  Which  way  shall  we  take? \\nYonder  eastward  arch?’ \\n\\n‘Maybe,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘But  I  do  not  know  yet  exactly \\nwhere  we  are.  Unless  I  am  quite  astray,  I  guess  that  we  are \\nabove  and  to  the  north  of  the  Great  Gates;  and  it  may  not  be \\neasy  to  find  the  right  road  down  to  them.  The  eastern  arch \\nwill  probably  prove  to  be  the  way  that  we  must  take;  but \\nbefore  we  make  up  our  minds  we  ought  to  look  about  us.  Let \\nus  go  towards  that  light  in  the  north  door.  If  we  could  find  a \\nwindow  it  would  help,  but  I  fear  that  the  light  comes  only \\ndown  deep  shafts.’ \\n\\nFollowing  his  lead  the  Company  passed  under  the  northern \\narch.  They  found  themselves  in  a  wide  corridor.  As  they  went \\nalong  it  the  glimmer  grew  stronger,  and  they  saw  that  it  came \\nthrough  a  doorway  on  their  right.  It  was  high  and  flat-topped, \\n\\n\\n416  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nand  the  stone  door  was  still  upon  its  hinges,  standing  half \\nopen.  Beyond  it  was  a  large  square  chamber.  It  was  dimly  lit, \\nbut  to  their  eyes,  after  so  long  a  time  in  the  dark,  it  seemed \\ndazzlingly  bright,  and  they  blinked  as  they  entered. \\n\\nTheir  feet  disturbed  a  deep  dust  upon  the  floor,  and \\nstumbled  among  things  lying  in  the  doorway  whose  shapes \\nthey  could  not  at  first  make  out.  The  chamber  was  lit  by  a \\nwide  shaft  high  in  the  further  eastern  wall;  it  slanted  upwards \\nand,  far  above,  a  small  square  patch  of  blue  sky  could  be \\nseen.  The  light  of  the  shaft  fell  directly  on  a  table  in  the \\nmiddle  of  the  room:  a  single  oblong  block,  about  two  feet \\nhigh,  upon  which  was  laid  a  great  slab  of  white  stone. \\n\\n‘It  looks  like  a  tomb,’  muttered  Frodo,  and  bent  forwards \\nwith  a  curious  sense  of  foreboding,  to  look  more  closely  at  it. \\nGandalf  came  quickly  to  his  side.  On  the  slab  runes  were \\ndeeply  graven: \\n\\n\\nkhm \\n\\n\\nA  JOURNEY  IN  THE  DARK \\n\\n\\n417 \\n\\n\\n‘These  are  Daeron’s  Runes,  such  as  were  used  of  old  in \\nMoria,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Here  is  written  in  the  tongues  of  Men \\nand  Dwarves: \\n\\n\\nBALIN  SON  OF  FUNDIN \\nLORD  OF  MORIA.’ \\n\\n‘He  is  dead  then,’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  feared  it  was  so.’  Gimli \\ncast  his  hood  over  his  face. \\n\\n\\nChapter  5 \\n\\n\\nTHE  BRIDGE  OF  KHAZAD-DUM \\n\\n\\nThe  Company  of  the  Ring  stood  silent  beside  the  tomb  of \\nBalin.  Frodo  thought  of  Bilbo  and  his  long  friendship  with \\nthe  dwarf,  and  of  Balin’s  visit  to  the  Shire  long  ago.  In  that \\ndusty  chamber  in  the  mountains  it  seemed  a  thousand  years \\nago  and  on  the  other  side  of  the  world. \\n\\nAt  length  they  stirred  and  looked  up,  and  began  to  search \\nfor  anything  that  would  give  them  tidings  of  Balin’s  fate,  or \\nshow  what  had  become  of  his  folk.  There  was  another  smaller \\ndoor  on  the  other  side  of  the  chamber,  under  the  shaft.  By \\nboth  the  doors  they  could  now  see  that  many  bones  were \\nlying,  and  among  them  were  broken  swords  and  axe-heads, \\nand  cloven  shields  and  helms.  Some  of  the  swords  were \\ncrooked:  orc-scimitars  with  blackened  blades. \\n\\nThere  were  many  recesses  cut  in  the  rock  of  the  walls,  and \\nin  them  were  large  iron-bound  chests  of  wood.  All  had \\nbeen  broken  and  plundered;  but  beside  the  shattered  lid  of \\none  there  lay  the  remains  of  a  book.  It  had  been  slashed \\nand  stabbed  and  partly  burned,  and  it  was  so  stained  with \\nblack  and  other  dark  marks  like  old  blood  that  little  of  it \\ncould  be  read.  Gandalf  lifted  it  carefully,  but  the  leaves \\ncracked  and  broke  as  he  laid  it  on  the  slab.  He  pored  over \\nit  for  some  time  without  speaking.  Frodo  and  Gimli  stand¬ \\ning  at  his  side  could  see,  as  he  gingerly  turned  the  leaves, \\nthat  they  were  written  by  many  different  hands,  in  runes, \\nboth  of  Moria  and  of  Dale,  and  here  and  there  in  Elvish \\nscript. \\n\\nAt  last  Gandalf  looked  up.  ‘It  seems  to  be  a  record  of  the \\nfortunes  of  Balin’s  folk,’  he  said.  ‘I  guess  that  it  began  with \\ntheir  coming  to  Dimrill  Dale  nigh  on  thirty  years  ago:  the \\npages  seem  to  have  numbers  referring  to  the  years  after  their \\n\\n\\nTHE  BRIDGE  OF  KHAZAD-DUM  419 \\n\\narrival.  The  top  page  is  marked  one  -  three,  so  at  least  two \\nare  missing  from  the  beginning.  Listen  to  this! \\n\\n‘  We  drove  out  ores  from  the  great  gate  and  guard  -  I  think; \\nthe  next  word  is  blurred  and  burned:  probably  room  -  we  slew \\nmany  in  the  bright  -  I  think  -  sun  in  the  dale.  Floi  was  killed  by \\nan  arrow.  He  slew  the  great.  Then  there  is  a  blur  followed  by \\nFloi  under  grass  near  Mirror  mere.  The  next  line  or  two  I \\ncannot  read.  Then  comes  We  have  taken  the  twentyfirst  hall \\nof  North  end  to  dwell  in.  There  is  I  cannot  read  what.  A  shaft \\nis  mentioned.  Then  Balin  has  set  up  his  seat  in  the  Chamber  of \\nMazarbuV \\n\\n‘The  Chamber  of  Records,’  said  Gimli.  ‘I  guess  that  is \\nwhere  we  now  stand.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  I  can  read  no  more  for  a  long  way,’  said  Gandalf, \\n‘except  the  word  gold,  and  Dunn’s  Axe  and  something  helm. \\nThen  Balin  is  now  lord  ofMoria.  That  seems  to  end  a  chapter. \\nAfter  some  stars  another  hand  begins,  and  I  can  see  we  found \\ntruesilver,  and  later  the  word  wellforged,  and  then  something, \\nI  have  it!  mithril\\',  and  the  last  two  lines  Oin  to  seek  for  the  upper \\narmouries  of  Third  Deep,  something  go  westwards,  a  blur,  to \\nHollin  gate.’ \\n\\nGandalf  paused  and  set  a  few  leaves  aside.  ‘There  are \\nseveral  pages  of  the  same  sort,  rather  hastily  written  and \\nmuch  damaged,’  he  said;  ‘but  I  can  make  little  of  them  in  this \\nlight.  Now  there  must  be  a  number  of  leaves  missing,  because \\nthey  begin  to  be  numbered  five,  the  fifth  year  of  the  colony, \\nI  suppose.  Let  me  see!  No,  they  are  too  cut  and  stained;  I \\ncannot  read  them.  We  might  do  better  in  the  sunlight.  Wait! \\nHere  is  something:  a  large  bold  hand  using  an  Elvish  script.’ \\n\\n‘That  would  be  Ori’s  hand,’  said  Gimli,  looking  over  the \\nwizard’s  arm.  ‘He  could  write  well  and  speedily,  and  often \\nused  the  Elvish  characters.’ \\n\\n‘I  fear  he  had  ill  tidings  to  record  in  a  fair  hand,’  said \\nGandalf.  ‘The  first  clear  word  is  sorrow,  but  the  rest  of  the \\nline  is  lost,  unless  it  ends  in  estre.  Yes,  it  must  be  yestre \\nfollowed  by  day  being  the  tenth  ofnovembre  Balin  lord  ofMoria \\n\\n\\n420  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nfell  in  Dimrill  Dale.

The  remainder  of  the  page \\nis  so  blurred  that  I  can  hardly  make  anything  out,  but  I  think \\nI  can  read  we  have  barred  the  gates,  and  then  can  hold  them \\nlong  if  and  then  perhaps  horrible  and  suffer.  Poor  Balin!  He \\nseems  to  have  kept  the  title  that  he  took  for  less  than  five \\nyears.  I  wonder  what  happened  afterwards;  but  there  is  no \\ntime  to  puzzle  out  the  last  few  pages.  Here  is  the  last  page  of \\nall.’  He  paused  and  sighed. \\n\\n‘It  is  grim  reading,’  he  said.  ‘I  fear  their  end  was  cruel. \\nListen!  We  cannot  get  out.  We  cannot  get  out.  They  have  taken \\nthe  Bridge  and  second  hall.  Frar  and  Loni  and  Nali  fell  there. \\nThen  there  are  four  lines  smeared  so  that  I  can  only  read \\nwent  5  days  ago.  The  last  lines  run  the  pool  is  up  to  the  wall \\nat  Westgate.  The  Watcher  in  the  Water  took  Oin.  We  cannot \\nget  out.  The  end  comes,  and  then  drums,  drums  in  the  deep.  I \\nwonder  what  that  means.  The  last  thing  written  is  in  a  trailing \\nscrawl  of  elf-letters:  they  are  coming.  There  is  nothing  more.’ \\nGandalf  paused  and  stood  in  silent  thought. \\n\\nA  sudden  dread  and  a  horror  of  the  chamber  fell  on  the \\nCompany.  ‘We  cannot  get  out,’  muttered  Gimli.  ‘It  was  well \\nfor  us  that  the  pool  had  sunk  a  little,  and  that  the  Watcher \\nwas  sleeping  down  at  the  southern  end.’ \\n\\nGandalf  raised  his  head  and  looked  round.  ‘They  seem  to \\nhave  made  a  last  stand  by  both  doors,’  he  said;  ‘but  there \\nwere  not  many  left  by  that  time.  So  ended  the  attempt  to \\nretake  Moria!  It  was  valiant  but  foolish.  The  time  is  not  come \\nyet.  Now,  I  fear,  we  must  say  farewell  to  Balin  son  of  Fundin. \\nHere  he  must  lie  in  the  halls  of  his  fathers.  We  will  take  this \\nbook,  the  Book  of  Mazarbul,  and  look  at  it  more  closely  later. \\nYou  had  better  keep  it,  Gimli,  and  take  it  back  to  Dain,  if \\nyou  get  a  chance.  It  will  interest  him,  though  it  will  grieve \\nhim  deeply.  Come,  let  us  go!  The  morning  is  passing.’ \\n\\n‘Which  way  shall  we  go?’  asked  Boromir. \\n\\n‘Back  to  the  hall,’  answered  Gandalf.  ‘But  our  visit  to  this \\nroom  has  not  been  in  vain.  I  now  know  where  we  are.  This \\n\\n\\nTHE  BRIDGE  OF  ICHAZAD-DUM \\n\\n\\n421 \\n\\n\\nmust  be,  as  Gimli  says,  the  Chamber  of  Mazarbul;  and  the \\nhall  must  be  the  twenty-first  of  the  North-end.  Therefore  we \\nshould  leave  by  the  eastern  arch  of  the  hall,  and  bear  right \\nand  south,  and  go  downwards.  The  Twenty-first  Hall  should \\nbe  on  the  Seventh  Level,  that  is  six  above  the  level  of  the \\nGates.  Come  now!  Back  to  the  hall!’ \\n\\nGandalf  had  hardly  spoken  these  words,  when  there  came \\na  great  noise:  a  rolling  Boom  that  seemed  to  come  from  depths \\nfar  below,  and  to  tremble  in  the  stone  at  their  feet.  They \\nsprang  towards  the  door  in  alarm.  Doom ,  doom  it  rolled  again, \\nas  if  huge  hands  were  turning  the  very  caverns  of  Moria  into  a \\nvast  drum.  Then  there  came  an  echoing  blast:  a  great  horn  was \\nblown  in  the  hall,  and  answering  horns  and  harsh  cries  were \\nheard  further  off.  There  was  a  hurrying  sound  of  many  feet. \\n\\n‘They  are  coming!’  cried  Legolas. \\n\\n‘We  cannot  get  out,’  said  Gimli. \\n\\n‘Trapped!’  cried  Gandalf.  ‘Why  did  I  delay?  Here  we  are, \\ncaught,  just  as  they  were  before.  But  I  was  not  here  then.  We \\nwill  see  what - ’ \\n\\nDoom ,  doom  came  the  drum-beat  and  the  walls  shook. \\n\\n‘Slam  the  doors  and  wedge  them!’  shouted  Aragorn.  ‘And \\nkeep  your  packs  on  as  long  as  you  can:  we  may  get  a  chance \\nto  cut  our  way  out  yet.’ \\n\\n‘No!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘We  must  not  get  shut  in.  Keep  the \\neast  door  ajar!  We  will  go  that  way,  if  we  get  a  chance.’ \\n\\nAnother  harsh  horn-call  and  shrill  cries  rang  out.  Feet  were \\ncoming  down  the  corridor.  There  was  a  ring  and  clatter  as \\nthe  Company  drew  their  swords.  Glamdring  shone  with  a \\npale  light,  and  Sting  glinted  at  the  edges.  Boromir  set  his \\nshoulder  against  the  western  door. \\n\\nWait  a  moment!  Do  not  close  it  yet!’  said  Gandalf.  He \\nsprang  forward  to  Boromir’s  side  and  drew  himself  up  to  his \\nfull  height. \\n\\n‘Who  comes  hither  to  disturb  the  rest  of  Balin  Lord  of \\nMoria?’  he  cried  in  a  loud  voice. \\n\\nThere  was  a  rush  of  hoarse  laughter,  like  the  fall  of  sliding \\n\\n\\n422 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nstones  into  a  pit;  amid  the  clamour  a  deep  voice  was  raised \\nin  command.  Doom,  boom,  doom  went  the  drums  in  the  deep. \\n\\nWith  a  quick  movement  Gandalf  stepped  before  the  nar¬ \\nrow  opening  of  the  door  and  thrust  forward  his  staff.  There \\nwas  a  dazzling  flash  that  lit  the  chamber  and  the  passage \\noutside.  For  an  instant  the  wizard  looked  out.  Arrows  whined \\nand  whistled  down  the  corridor  as  he  sprang  back. \\n\\n‘There  are  Ores,  very  many  of  them,’  he  said.  ‘And  some \\nare  large  and  evil:  black  Uruks  of  Mordor.  For  the  moment \\nthey  are  hanging  back,  but  there  is  something  else  there.  A \\ngreat  cave -troll,  I  think,  or  more  than  one.  There  is  no  hope \\nof  escape  that  way.’ \\n\\n‘And  no  hope  at  all,  if  they  come  at  the  other  door  as  well,’ \\nsaid  Boromir. \\n\\n‘There  is  no  sound  outside  here  yet,’  said  Aragorn,  who \\nwas  standing  by  the  eastern  door  listening.  ‘The  passage  on \\nthis  side  plunges  straight  down  a  stair:  it  plainly  does  not  lead \\nback  towards  the  hall.  But  it  is  no  good  flying  blindly  this \\nway  with  the  pursuit  just  behind.  We  cannot  block  the  door. \\nIts  key  is  gone  and  the  lock  is  broken,  and  it  opens  inwards. \\nWe  must  do  something  to  delay  the  enemy  first.  We  will \\nmake  them  fear  the  Chamber  of  Mazarbul!’  he  said  grimly, \\nfeeling  the  edge  of  his  sword,  Anduril. \\n\\nHeavy  feet  were  heard  in  the  corridor.  Boromir  flung  him¬ \\nself  against  the  door  and  heaved  it  to;  then  he  wedged  it  with \\nbroken  sword-blades  and  splinters  of  wood.  The  Company \\nretreated  to  the  other  side  of  the  chamber.  But  they  had  no \\nchance  to  fly  yet.  There  was  a  blow  on  the  door  that  made  it \\nquiver;  and  then  it  began  to  grind  slowly  open,  driving  back \\nthe  wedges.  A  huge  arm  and  shoulder,  with  a  dark  skin  of \\ngreenish  scales,  was  thrust  through  the  widening  gap.  Then \\na  great,  flat,  toeless  foot  was  forced  through  below.  There \\nwas  a  dead  silence  outside. \\n\\nBoromir  leaped  forward  and  hewed  at  the  arm  with  all  his \\nmight;  but  his  sword  rang,  glanced  aside,  and  fell  from  his \\nshaken  hand.  The  blade  was  notched. \\n\\n\\nTHE  BRIDGE  OF  KHAZAD-DUM  423 \\n\\nSuddenly,  and  to  his  own  surprise,  Frodo  felt  a  hot  wrath \\nblaze  up  in  his  heart.  ‘The  Shire!’  he  cried,  and  springing \\nbeside  Boromir,  he  stooped,  and  stabbed  with  Sting  at  the \\nhideous  foot.  There  was  a  bellow,  and  the  foot  jerked  back, \\nnearly  wrenching  Sting  from  Frodo’s  arm.  Black  drops \\ndripped  from  the  blade  and  smoked  on  the  floor.  Boromir \\nhurled  himself  against  the  door  and  slammed  it  again. \\n\\n‘One  for  the  Shire!’  cried  Aragorn.  ‘The  hobbit’s  bite  is \\ndeep!  You  have  a  good  blade,  Frodo  son  of  Drogo!’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  crash  on  the  door,  followed  by  crash  after \\ncrash.  Rams  and  hammers  were  beating  against  it.  It  cracked \\nand  staggered  back,  and  the  opening  grew  suddenly  wide. \\nArrows  came  whistling  in,  but  struck  the  northern  wall,  and \\nfell  harmlessly  to  the  floor.  There  was  a  horn-blast  and  a  rush \\nof  feet,  and  ores  one  after  another  leaped  into  the  chamber. \\n\\nHow  many  there  were  the  Company  could  not  count.  The \\naffray  was  sharp,  but  the  ores  were  dismayed  by  the  fierceness \\nof  the  defence.  Legolas  shot  two  through  the  throat.  Gimli \\nhewed  the  legs  from  under  another  that  had  sprung  up  on \\nBalin’s  tomb.  Boromir  and  Aragorn  slew  many.  When  thir¬ \\nteen  had  fallen  the  rest  fled  shrieking,  leaving  the  defenders \\nunharmed,  except  for  Sam  who  had  a  scratch  along  the  scalp. \\nA  quick  duck  had  saved  him;  and  he  had  felled  his  ore:  a \\nsturdy  thrust  with  his  Barrow-blade.  A  fire  was  smouldering \\nin  his  brown  eyes  that  would  have  made  Ted  Sandyman  step \\nbackwards,  if  he  had  seen  it. \\n\\n‘Now  is  the  time!’  cried  Gandalf.  ‘Let  us  go,  before  the \\ntroll  returns!’ \\n\\nBut  even  as  they  retreated,  and  before  Pippin  and  Merry \\nhad  reached  the  stair  outside,  a  huge  orc-chieftain,  almost \\nman-high,  clad  in  black  mail  from  head  to  foot,  leaped  into \\nthe  chamber;  behind  him  his  followers  clustered  in  the  door¬ \\nway.  His  broad  flat  face  was  swart,  his  eyes  were  like  coals, \\nand  his  tongue  was  red;  he  wielded  a  great  spear.  With  a \\nthrust  of  his  huge  hide  shield  he  turned  Boromir’s  sword  and \\nbore  him  backwards,  throwing  him  to  the  ground.  Diving \\nunder  Aragorn’s  blow  with  the  speed  of  a  striking  snake  he \\n\\n\\n424  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\ncharged  into  the  Company  and  thrust  with  his  spear  straight \\nat  Frodo.  The  blow  caught  him  on  the  right  side,  and  Frodo \\nwas  hurled  against  the  wall  and  pinned.  Sam,  with  a  cry, \\nhacked  at  the  spear-shaft,  and  it  broke.  But  even  as  the  ore \\nflung  down  the  truncheon  and  swept  out  his  scimitar,  Anduril \\ncame  down  upon  his  helm.  There  was  a  flash  like  flame  and \\nthe  helm  burst  asunder.  The  ore  fell  with  cloven  head.  His \\nfollowers  fled  howling,  as  Boromir  and  Aragorn  sprang  at \\nthem. \\n\\nDoom ,  doom  went  the  drums  in  the  deep.  The  great  voice \\nrolled  out  again. \\n\\n‘Now!’  shouted  Gandalf.  ‘Now  is  the  last  chance.  Run \\nfor  it!’ \\n\\nAragorn  picked  up  Frodo  where  he  lay  by  the  wall  and \\nmade  for  the  stair,  pushing  Merry  and  Pippin  in  front  of  him. \\nThe  others  followed;  but  Gimli  had  to  be  dragged  away  by \\nLegolas:  in  spite  of  the  peril  he  lingered  by  Balin’ s  tomb  with \\nhis  head  bowed.  Boromir  hauled  the  eastern  door  to,  grinding \\nupon  its  hinges:  it  had  great  iron  rings  on  either  side,  but \\ncould  not  be  fastened. \\n\\n‘I  am  all  right,’  gasped  Frodo.  ‘I  can  walk.  Put  me  down!’ \\n\\nAragorn  nearly  dropped  him  in  his  amazement.  ‘I  thought \\nyou  were  dead!’  he  cried. \\n\\n‘Not  yet!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘But  there  is  no  time  for  wonder. \\nOff  you  go,  all  of  you,  down  the  stairs!  Wait  a  few  minutes \\nfor  me  at  the  bottom,  but  if  I  do  not  come  soon,  go  on!  Go \\nquickly  and  choose  paths  leading  right  and  downwards.’ \\n\\n‘We  cannot  leave  you  to  hold  the  door  alone!’  said  Aragorn. \\n\\n‘Do  as  I  say!’  said  Gandalf  fiercely.  ‘Swords  are  no  more \\nuse  here.  Go!’ \\n\\nThe  passage  was  lit  by  no  shaft  and  was  utterly  dark.  They \\ngroped  their  way  down  a  long  flight  of  steps,  and  then  looked \\nback;  but  they  could  see  nothing,  except  high  above  them  the \\nfaint  glimmer  of  the  wizard’s  staff.  He  seemed  to  be  still \\nstanding  on  guard  by  the  closed  door.  Frodo  breathed  heavily \\n\\n\\nTHE  BRIDGE  OF  KHAZAD-DUM  425 \\n\\nand  leaned  against  Sam,  who  put  his  arms  about  him.  They \\nstood  peering  up  the  stairs  into  the  darkness.  Frodo  thought \\nhe  could  hear  the  voice  of  Gandalf  above,  muttering  words \\nthat  ran  down  the  sloping  roof  with  a  sighing  echo.  He  could \\nnot  catch  what  was  said.  The  walls  seemed  to  be  trembling. \\nEvery  now  and  again  the  drum-beats  throbbed  and  rolled: \\ndoom ,  doom. \\n\\nSuddenly  at  the  top  of  the  stair  there  was  a  stab  of  white \\nlight.  Then  there  was  a  dull  rumble  and  a  heavy  thud.  The \\ndrum-beats  broke  out  wildly:  doom-boom ,  doom-boom ,  and \\nthen  stopped.  Gandalf  came  flying  down  the  steps  and  fell  to \\nthe  ground  in  the  midst  of  the  Company. \\n\\n‘Well,  well!  That’s  over!’  said  the  wizard  struggling  to  his \\nfeet.  ‘I  have  done  all  that  I  could.  But  I  have  met  my  match, \\nand  have  nearly  been  destroyed.  But  don’t  stand  here!  Go \\non!  You  will  have  to  do  without  light  for  a  while:  I  am  rather \\nshaken.  Go  on!  Go  on!  Where  are  you,  Gimli?  Come  ahead \\nwith  me!  Keep  close  behind,  all  of  you!’ \\n\\nThey  stumbled  after  him  wondering  what  had  happened. \\nDoom ,  doom  went  the  drum-beats  again:  they  now  sounded \\nmuffled  and  far  away,  but  they  were  following.  There  was  no \\nother  sound  of  pursuit,  neither  tramp  of  feet,  nor  any  voice. \\nGandalf  took  no  turns,  right  or  left,  for  the  passage  seemed \\nto  be  going  in  the  direction  that  he  desired.  Every  now  and \\nagain  it  descended  a  flight  of  steps,  fifty  or  more,  to  a  lower \\nlevel.  At  the  moment  that  was  their  chief  danger;  for  in  the \\ndark  they  could  not  see  a  descent,  until  they  came  on  it  and \\nput  their  feet  out  into  emptiness.  Gandalf  felt  the  ground \\nwith  his  staff  like  a  blind  man. \\n\\nAt  the  end  of  an  hour  they  had  gone  a  mile,  or  maybe  a \\nlittle  more,  and  had  descended  many  flights  of  stairs.  There \\nwas  still  no  sound  of  pursuit.  Almost  they  began  to  hope \\nthat  they  would  escape.  At  the  bottom  of  the  seventh  flight \\nGandalf  halted. \\n\\n‘It  is  getting  hot!’  he  gasped.  ‘We  ought  to  be  down  at  least \\nto  the  level  of  the  Gates  now.  Soon  I  think  we  should  look \\n\\n\\n426  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nfor  a  left-hand  turn  to  take  us  east.  I  hope  it  is  not  far.  I  am \\nvery  weary.  I  must  rest  here  a  moment,  even  if  all  the  ores \\never  spawned  are  after  us.’ \\n\\nGimli  took  his  arm  and  helped  him  down  to  a  seat  on  the \\nstep.  ‘What  happened  away  up  there  at  the  door?’  he  asked. \\n‘Did  you  meet  the  beater  of  the  drums?’ \\n\\n‘I  do  not  know,’  answered  Gandalf.  ‘But  I  found  myself \\nsuddenly  faced  by  something  that  I  have  not  met  before.  I \\ncould  think  of  nothing  to  do  but  to  try  and  put  a  shutting-spell \\non  the  door.  I  know  many;  but  to  do  things  of  that  kind \\nrightly  requires  time,  and  even  then  the  door  can  be  broken \\nby  strength. \\n\\n‘As  I  stood  there  I  could  hear  orc-voices  on  the  other  side: \\nat  any  moment  I  thought  they  would  burst  it  open.  I  could \\nnot  hear  what  was  said;  they  seemed  to  be  talking  in  their \\nown  hideous  language.  All  I  caught  was  ghask.  that  is  “fire”. \\nThen  something  came  into  the  chamber  -  I  felt  it  through \\nthe  door,  and  the  ores  themselves  were  afraid  and  fell  silent. \\nIt  laid  hold  of  the  iron  ring,  and  then  it  perceived  me  and  my \\nspell. \\n\\n‘What  it  was  I  cannot  guess,  but  I  have  never  felt  such  a \\nchallenge.  The  counter-spell  was  terrible.  It  nearly  broke  me. \\nFor  an  instant  the  door  left  my  control  and  began  to  open!  I \\nhad  to  speak  a  word  of  Command.  That  proved  too  great  a \\nstrain.  The  door  burst  in  pieces.  Something  dark  as  a  cloud \\nwas  blocking  out  all  the  light  inside,  and  I  was  thrown  back¬ \\nwards  down  the  stairs.  All  the  wall  gave  way,  and  the  roof  of \\nthe  chamber  as  well,  I  think. \\n\\n‘I  am  afraid  Balin  is  buried  deep,  and  maybe  something \\nelse  is  buried  there  too.  I  cannot  say.  But  at  least  the  passage \\nbehind  us  was  completely  blocked.  Ah!  I  have  never  felt  so \\nspent,  but  it  is  passing.  And  now  what  about  you,  Frodo? \\nThere  was  not  time  to  say  so,  but  I  have  never  been  more \\ndelighted  in  my  life  than  when  you  spoke.  I  feared  that  it  was \\na  brave  but  dead  hobbit  that  Aragorn  was  carrying.’ \\n\\nWhat  about  me?’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  am  alive,  and  whole  I \\nthink.  I  am  bruised  and  in  pain,  but  it  is  not  too  bad.’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  BRIDGE  OF  KHAZAD-DUM  427 \\n\\n‘Well,’  said  Aragorn,  ‘I  can  only  say  that  hobbits  are  made \\nof  a  stuff  so  tough  that  I  have  never  met  the  like  of  it.  Had  I \\nknown,  I  would  have  spoken  softer  in  the  Inn  at  Bree!  That \\nspear-thrust  would  have  skewered  a  wild  boar!’ \\n\\nWell,  it  did  not  skewer  me,  I  am  glad  to  say,’  said  Frodo; \\n‘though  I  feel  as  if  I  had  been  caught  between  a  hammer  and \\nan  anvil.’  He  said  no  more.  He  found  breathing  painful. \\n\\n‘You  take  after  Bilbo,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘There  is  more  about \\nyou  than  meets  the  eye,  as  I  said  of  him  long  ago.’  Frodo \\nwondered  if  the  remark  meant  more  than  it  said. \\n\\nThey  now  went  on  again.  Before  long  Gimli  spoke.  He \\nhad  keen  eyes  in  the  dark.  ‘I  think,’  he  said,  ‘that  there  is  a \\nlight  ahead.  But  it  is  not  daylight.  It  is  red.  What  can  it  be?’ \\n\\n‘Ghash!’  muttered  Gandalf.  ‘I  wonder  if  that  is  what  they \\nmeant:  that  the  lower  levels  are  on  fire?  Still,  we  can  only \\ngo  on.’ \\n\\nSoon  the  light  became  unmistakable,  and  could  be  seen  by \\nall.  It  was  flickering  and  glowing  on  the  walls  away  down  the \\npassage  before  them.  They  could  now  see  their  way:  in  front \\nthe  road  sloped  down  swiftly,  and  some  way  ahead  there \\nstood  a  low  archway;  through  it  the  growing  light  came.  The \\nair  became  very  hot. \\n\\nWhen  they  came  to  the  arch  Gandalf  went  through,  signing \\nto  them  to  wait.  As  he  stood  just  beyond  the  opening  they \\nsaw  his  face  lit  by  a  red  glow.  Quickly  he  stepped  back. \\n\\n‘There  is  some  new  devilry  here,’  he  said,  ‘devised  for  our \\nwelcome,  no  doubt.  But  I  know  now  where  we  are:  we  have \\nreached  the  First  Deep,  the  level  immediately  below  the \\nGates.  This  is  the  Second  Hall  of  Old  Moria;  and  the  Gates \\nare  near:  away  beyond  the  eastern  end,  on  the  left,  not  more \\nthan  a  quarter  of  a  mile.  Across  the  Bridge,  up  a  broad  stair, \\nalong  a  wide  road,  through  the  First  Hall,  and  out!  But  come \\nand  look!’ \\n\\nThey  peered  out.  Before  them  was  another  cavernous  hall. \\nIt  was  loftier  and  far  longer  than  the  one  in  which  they  had \\nslept.  They  were  near  its  eastern  end;  westward  it  ran  away \\n\\n\\n428  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\ninto  darkness.  Down  the  centre  stalked  a  double  line  of  tower¬ \\ning  pillars.  They  were  carved  like  boles  of  mighty  trees  whose \\nboughs  upheld  the  roof  with  a  branching  tracery  of  stone. \\nTheir  stems  were  smooth  and  black,  but  a  red  glow  was \\ndarkly  mirrored  in  their  sides.  Right  across  the  floor,  close  to \\nthe  feet  of  two  huge  pillars  a  great  fissure  had  opened.  Out \\nof  it  a  fierce  red  light  came,  and  now  and  again  flames  licked \\nat  the  brink  and  curled  about  the  bases  of  the  columns.  Wisps \\nof  dark  smoke  wavered  in  the  hot  air. \\n\\n‘If  we  had  come  by  the  main  road  down  from  the  upper \\nhalls,  we  should  have  been  trapped  here,’  said  Gandalf.  ‘Let \\nus  hope  that  the  fire  now  lies  between  us  and  pursuit.  Come! \\nThere  is  no  time  to  lose.’ \\n\\nEven  as  he  spoke  they  heard  again  the  pursuing  drum-beat: \\nDoom ,  doom ,  doom.  Away  beyond  the  shadows  at  the  western \\nend  of  the  hall  there  came  cries  and  horn-calls.  Doom,  doom-. \\nthe  pillars  seemed  to  tremble  and  the  flames  to  quiver. \\n\\n‘Now  for  the  last  race!’  said  Gandalf.  ‘If  the  sun  is  shining \\noutside,  we  may  still  escape.  After  me!’ \\n\\nHe  turned  left  and  sped  across  the  smooth  floor  of  the  hall. \\nThe  distance  was  greater  than  it  had  looked.  As  they  ran  they \\nheard  the  beat  and  echo  of  many  hurrying  feet  behind.  A \\nshrill  yell  went  up:  they  had  been  seen.  There  was  a  ring  and \\nclash  of  steel.  An  arrow  whistled  over  Frodo’s  head. \\n\\nBoromir  laughed.  ‘They  did  not  expect  this,’  he  said.  ‘The \\nfire  has  cut  them  off.  We  are  on  the  wrong  side!’ \\n\\n‘Look  ahead!’  called  Gandalf.  ‘The  Bridge  is  near.  It  is \\ndangerous  and  narrow.’ \\n\\nSuddenly  Frodo  saw  before  him  a  black  chasm.  At  the  end \\nof  the  hall  the  floor  vanished  and  fell  to  an  unknown  depth. \\nThe  outer  door  could  only  be  reached  by  a  slender  bridge  of \\nstone,  without  kerb  or  rail,  that  spanned  the  chasm  with  one \\ncurving  spring  of  fifty  feet.  It  was  an  ancient  defence  of  the \\nDwarves  against  any  enemy  that  might  capture  the  First  Hall \\nand  the  outer  passages.  They  could  only  pass  across  it  in \\nsingle  file.  At  the  brink  Gandalf  halted  and  the  others  came \\nup  in  a  pack  behind. \\n\\n\\nTHE  BRIDGE  OF  KHAZAD-DUM  429 \\n\\n‘Lead  the  way,  Gimli!’  he  said.  ‘Pippin  and  Merry  next. \\nStraight  on,  and  up  the  stair  beyond  the  door!’ \\n\\nArrows  fell  among  them.  One  struck  Frodo  and  sprang \\nback.  Another  pierced  Gandalf’s  hat  and  stuck  there  like  a \\nblack  feather.  Frodo  looked  behind.  Beyond  the  fire  he  saw \\nswarming  black  figures:  there  seemed  to  be  hundreds  of  ores. \\nThey  brandished  spears  and  scimitars  which  shone  red  as \\nblood  in  the  firelight.  Doom ,  doom  rolled  the  drum-beats, \\ngrowing  louder  and  louder,  doom ,  doom. \\n\\nLegolas  turned  and  set  an  arrow  to  the  string,  though  it \\nwas  a  long  shot  for  his  small  bow.  He  drew,  but  his  hand  fell, \\nand  the  arrow  slipped  to  the  ground.  He  gave  a  cry  of  dismay \\nand  fear.  Two  great  trolls  appeared;  they  bore  great  slabs  of \\nstone,  and  flung  them  down  to  serve  as  gangways  over  the \\nfire.  But  it  was  not  the  trolls  that  had  filled  the  Elf  with  terror. \\nThe  ranks  of  the  ores  had  opened,  and  they  crowded  away, \\nas  if  they  themselves  were  afraid.  Something  was  coming  up \\nbehind  them.  What  it  was  could  not  be  seen:  it  was  like  a \\ngreat  shadow,  in  the  middle  of  which  was  a  dark  form,  of \\nman-shape  maybe,  yet  greater;  and  a  power  and  terror \\nseemed  to  be  in  it  and  to  go  before  it. \\n\\nIt  came  to  the  edge  of  the  fire  and  the  light  faded  as  if  a \\ncloud  had  bent  over  it.  Then  with  a  rush  it  leaped  across  the \\nfissure.  The  flames  roared  up  to  greet  it,  and  wreathed  about \\nit;  and  a  black  smoke  swirled  in  the  air.  Its  streaming  mane \\nkindled,  and  blazed  behind  it.  In  its  right  hand  was  a  blade \\nlike  a  stabbing  tongue  of  fire;  in  its  left  it  held  a  whip  of  many \\nthongs. \\n\\n‘ Ai!  ai!’  wailed  Legolas.  ‘A  Balrog!  A  Balrog  is  come!’ \\n\\nGimli  stared  with  wide  eyes.  ‘Durin’s  Bane!’  he  cried,  and \\nletting  his  axe  fall  he  covered  his  face. \\n\\n‘A  Balrog,’  muttered  Gandalf.  ‘Now  I  understand.’  He \\nfaltered  and  leaned  heavily  on  his  staff.  ‘What  an  evil  fortune! \\nAnd  I  am  already  weary.’ \\n\\nThe  dark  figure  streaming  with  fire  raced  towards  them. \\nThe  ores  yelled  and  poured  over  the  stone  gangways.  Then \\n\\n\\n430 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nBoromir  raised  his  horn  and  blew.  Loud  the  challenge  rang \\nand  bellowed,  like  the  shout  of  many  throats  under  the \\ncavernous  roof.  For  a  moment  the  ores  quailed  and  the  fiery \\nshadow  halted.  Then  the  echoes  died  as  suddenly  as  a  flame \\nblown  out  by  a  dark  wind,  and  the  enemy  advanced  again. \\n\\n‘Over  the  bridge!’  cried  Gandalf,  recalling  his  strength. \\n‘Fly!  This  is  a  foe  beyond  any  of  you.  I  must  hold  the  narrow \\nway.  Fly!’  Aragorn  and  Boromir  did  not  heed  the  command, \\nbut  still  held  their  ground,  side  by  side,  behind  Gandalf  at \\nthe  far  end  of  the  bridge.  The  others  halted  just  within  the \\ndoorway  at  the  hall’s  end,  and  turned,  unable  to  leave  their \\nleader  to  face  the  enemy  alone. \\n\\nThe  Balrog  reached  the  bridge.  Gandalf  stood  in  the \\nmiddle  of  the  span,  leaning  on  the  staff  in  his  left  hand,  but \\nin  his  other  hand  Glamdring  gleamed,  cold  and  white.  Flis \\nenemy  halted  again,  facing  him,  and  the  shadow  about  it \\nreached  out  like  two  vast  wings.  It  raised  the  whip,  and  the \\nthongs  whined  and  cracked.  Fire  came  from  its  nostrils.  But \\nGandalf  stood  firm. \\n\\n‘You  cannot  pass,’  he  said.  The  ores  stood  still,  and  a  dead \\nsilence  fell.  ‘I  am  a  servant  of  the  Secret  Fire,  wielder  of  the \\nflame  of  Anor.  You  cannot  pass.  The  dark  fire  will  not  avail \\nyou,  flame  of  Udun.  Go  back  to  the  Shadow!  You  cannot \\npass.’ \\n\\nThe  Balrog  made  no  answer.  The  fire  in  it  seemed  to  die, \\nbut  the  darkness  grew.  It  stepped  forward  slowly  on  to  the \\nbridge,  and  suddenly  it  drew  itself  up  to  a  great  height,  and \\nits  wings  were  spread  from  wall  to  wall;  but  still  Gandalf \\ncould  be  seen,  glimmering  in  the  gloom;  he  seemed  small, \\nand  altogether  alone:  grey  and  bent,  like  a  wizened  tree  before \\nthe  onset  of  a  storm. \\n\\nFrom  out  of  the  shadow  a  red  sword  leaped  flaming. \\n\\nGlamdring  glittered  white  in  answer. \\n\\nThere  was  a  ringing  clash  and  a  stab  of  white  fire.  The \\nBalrog  fell  back,  and  its  sword  flew  up  in  molten  fragments. \\nThe  wizard  swayed  on  the  bridge,  stepped  back  a  pace,  and \\nthen  again  stood  still. \\n\\n\\nTHE  BRIDGE  OF  ICHAZAD-DUM \\n\\n\\n431 \\n\\n\\n‘You  cannot  pass!’  he  said. \\n\\nWith  a  bound  the  Balrog  leaped  full  upon  the  bridge.  Its \\nwhip  whirled  and  hissed. \\n\\n‘He  cannot  stand  alone!’  cried  Aragorn  suddenly  and  ran \\nback  along  the  bridge.  ‘ Elendil /’  he  shouted.  ‘I  am  with  you, \\nGandalf !’ \\n\\n‘Gondor!’  cried  Boromir  and  leaped  after  him. \\n\\nAt  that  moment  Gandalf  lifted  his  staff,  and  crying  aloud \\nhe  smote  the  bridge  before  him.  The  staff  broke  asunder  and \\nfell  from  his  hand.  A  blinding  sheet  of  white  flame  sprang \\nup.  The  bridge  cracked.  Right  at  the  Balrog’s  feet  it  broke, \\nand  the  stone  upon  which  it  stood  crashed  into  the  gulf,  while \\nthe  rest  remained,  poised,  quivering  like  a  tongue  of  rock \\nthrust  out  into  emptiness. \\n\\nWith  a  terrible  cry  the  Balrog  fell  forward,  and  its  shadow \\nplunged  down  and  vanished.  But  even  as  it  fell  it  swung  its \\nwhip,  and  the  thongs  lashed  and  curled  about  the  wizard’s \\nknees,  dragging  him  to  the  brink.  He  staggered  and  fell, \\ngrasped  vainly  at  the  stone,  and  slid  into  the  abyss.  ‘Fly,  you \\nfools!’  he  cried,  and  was  gone. \\n\\nThe  fires  went  out,  and  blank  darkness  fell.  The  Company \\nstood  rooted  with  horror  staring  into  the  pit.  Even  as  Aragorn \\nand  Boromir  came  flying  back,  the  rest  of  the  bridge  cracked \\nand  fell.  With  a  cry  Aragorn  roused  them. \\n\\n‘Come!  I  will  lead  you  now!’  he  called.  We  must  obey  his \\nlast  command.  Follow  me!’ \\n\\nThey  stumbled  wildly  up  the  great  stairs  beyond  the  door, \\nAragorn  leading,  Boromir  at  the  rear.  At  the  top  was  a  wide \\nechoing  passage.  Along  this  they  fled.  Frodo  heard  Sam  at \\nhis  side  weeping,  and  then  he  found  that  he  himself  was \\nweeping  as  he  ran.  Doom,  doom,  doom  the  drum-beats  rolled \\nbehind,  mournful  now  and  slow;  doom! \\n\\nThey  ran  on.  The  light  grew  before  them;  great  shafts \\npierced  the  roof.  They  ran  swifter.  They  passed  into  a  hall, \\nbright  with  daylight  from  its  high  windows  in  the  east.  They \\nfled  across  it.  Through  its  huge  broken  doors  they  passed, \\n\\n\\n432  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nand  suddenly  before  them  the  Great  Gates  opened,  an  arch \\nof  blazing  light. \\n\\nThere  was  a  guard  of  ores  crouching  in  the  shadows  behind \\nthe  great  door-posts  towering  on  either  side,  but  the  gates \\nwere  shattered  and  cast  down.  Aragorn  smote  to  the  ground \\nthe  captain  that  stood  in  his  path,  and  the  rest  fled  in  terror \\nof  his  wrath.  The  Company  swept  past  them  and  took  no \\nheed  of  them.  Out  of  the  Gates  they  ran  and  sprang  down \\nthe  huge  and  age -worn  steps,  the  threshold  of  Moria. \\n\\nThus,  at  last,  they  came  beyond  hope  under  the  sky  and \\nfelt  the  wind  on  their  faces. \\n\\nThey  did  not  halt  until  they  were  out  of  bowshot  from  the \\nwalls.  Dimrill  Dale  lay  about  them.  The  shadow  of  the  Misty \\nMountains  lay  upon  it,  but  eastwards  there  was  a  golden  light \\non  the  land.  It  was  but  one  hour  after  noon.  The  sun  was \\nshining;  the  clouds  were  white  and  high. \\n\\nThey  looked  back.  Dark  yawned  the  archway  of  the  Gates \\nunder  the  mountain-shadow.  Faint  and  far  beneath  the  earth \\nrolled  the  slow  drum-beats:  doom.  A  thin  black  smoke  trailed \\nout.  Nothing  else  was  to  be  seen;  the  dale  all  around  was \\nempty.  Doom.  Grief  at  last  wholly  overcame  them,  and  they \\nwept  long:  some  standing  and  silent,  some  cast  upon  the \\nground.  Doom,  doom.  The  drum-beats  faded. \\n\\n\\nChapter  6 \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN \\n\\n\\n‘Alas!  I  fear  we  cannot  stay  here  longer,’  said  Aragorn.  He \\nlooked  towards  the  mountains  and  held  up  his  sword.  ‘Fare¬ \\nwell,  Gandalf !’  he  cried.  ‘Did  I  not  say  to  you:  if  you  pass  the \\ndoors  of  Moria,  beware ?  Alas  that  I  spoke  true!  What  hope \\nhave  we  without  you?’ \\n\\nHe  turned  to  the  Company.  ‘We  must  do  without  hope,’ \\nhe  said.  ‘At  least  we  may  yet  be  avenged.  Let  us  gird  ourselves \\nand  weep  no  more!  Come!  We  have  a  long  road,  and  much \\nto  do.’ \\n\\nThey  rose  and  looked  about  them.  Northward  the  dale  ran \\nup  into  a  glen  of  shadows  between  two  great  arms  of  the \\nmountains,  above  which  three  white  peaks  were  shining: \\nCelebdil,  Fanuidhol,  Caradhras,  the  Mountains  of  Moria.  At \\nthe  head  of  the  glen  a  torrent  flowed  like  a  white  lace  over \\nan  endless  ladder  of  short  falls,  and  a  mist  of  foam  hung  in \\nthe  air  about  the  mountains’  feet. \\n\\n‘Yonder  is  the  Dimrill  Stair,’  said  Aragorn,  pointing  to  the \\nfalls.  ‘Down  the  deep-cloven  way  that  climbs  beside  the \\ntorrent  we  should  have  come,  if  fortune  had  been  kinder.’ \\n\\n‘Or  Caradhras  less  cruel,’  said  Gimli.  ‘There  he  stands \\nsmiling  in  the  sun!’  He  shook  his  fist  at  the  furthest  of  the \\nsnow-capped  peaks  and  turned  away. \\n\\nTo  the  east  the  outflung  arm  of  the  mountains  marched  to \\na  sudden  end,  and  far  lands  could  be  descried  beyond  them, \\nwide  and  vague.  To  the  south  the  Misty  Mountains  receded \\nendlessly  as  far  as  sight  could  reach.  Less  than  a  mile  away, \\nand  a  little  below  them,  for  they  still  stood  high  up  on  the \\nwest  side  of  the  dale,  there  lay  a  mere.  It  was  long  and  oval, \\nshaped  like  a  great  spear-head  thrust  deep  into  the  northern \\nglen;  but  its  southern  end  was  beyond  the  shadows  under  the \\n\\n\\n434 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nsunlit  sky.  Yet  its  waters  were  dark:  a  deep  blue  like  clear \\nevening  sky  seen  from  a  lamp-lit  room.  Its  face  was  still  and \\nunruffled.  About  it  lay  a  smooth  sward,  shelving  down  on  all \\nsides  to  its  bare  unbroken  rim. \\n\\n‘There  lies  the  Mirrormere,  deep  Kheled-zaram!’  said \\nGimli  sadly.  ‘I  remember  that  he  said:  “May  you  have  joy  of \\nthe  sight!  But  we  cannot  linger  there.”  Now  long  shall  I \\njourney  ere  I  have  joy  again.  It  is  I  that  must  hasten  away, \\nand  he  that  must  remain.’ \\n\\nThe  Company  now  went  down  the  road  from  the  Gates. \\nIt  was  rough  and  broken,  fading  to  a  winding  track  between \\nheather  and  whin  that  thrust  amid  the  cracking  stones.  But \\nstill  it  could  be  seen  that  once  long  ago  a  great  paved  way  had \\nwound  upwards  from  the  lowlands  to  the  Dwarf-kingdom.  In \\nplaces  there  were  ruined  works  of  stone  beside  the  path,  and \\nmounds  of  green  topped  with  slender  birches,  or  fir-trees \\nsighing  in  the  wind.  An  eastward  bend  led  them  hard  by  the \\nsward  of  Mirrormere,  and  there  not  far  from  the  roadside \\nstood  a  single  column  broken  at  the  top. \\n\\n‘That  is  Durin’s  Stone!’  cried  Gimli.  ‘I  cannot  pass  without \\nturning  aside  for  a  moment  to  look  at  the  wonder  of  the  dale!’ \\n\\n‘Be  swift  then!’  said  Aragorn,  looking  back  towards  the \\nGates.  ‘The  Sun  sinks  early.  The  Ores  will  not,  maybe,  come \\nout  till  after  dusk,  but  we  must  be  far  away  before  nightfall. \\nThe  Moon  is  almost  spent,  and  it  will  be  dark  tonight.’ \\n\\n‘Come  with  me,  Frodo!’  cried  the  dwarf,  springing  from \\nthe  road.  ‘I  would  not  have  you  go  without  seeing  Kheled- \\nzaram.’  He  ran  down  the  long  green  slope.  Frodo  followed \\nslowly,  drawn  by  the  still  blue  water  in  spite  of  hurt  and \\nweariness;  Sam  came  up  behind. \\n\\nBeside  the  standing  stone  Gimli  halted  and  looked  up.  It \\nwas  cracked  and  weather-worn,  and  the  faint  runes  upon  its \\nside  could  not  be  read.  ‘This  pillar  marks  the  spot  where \\nDurin  first  looked  in  the  Mirrormere,’  said  the  dwarf.  ‘Let  us \\nlook  ourselves  once,  ere  we  go!’ \\n\\nThey  stooped  over  the  dark  water.  At  first  they  could  see \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN \\n\\n\\n435 \\n\\n\\nnothing.  Then  slowly  they  saw  the  forms  of  the  encircling \\nmountains  mirrored  in  a  profound  blue,  and  the  peaks  were \\nlike  plumes  of  white  flame  above  them;  beyond  there  was  a \\nspace  of  sky.  There  like  jewels  sunk  in  the  deep  shone  glinting \\nstars,  though  sunlight  was  in  the  sky  above.  Of  their  own \\nstooping  forms  no  shadow  could  be  seen. \\n\\n‘O  Kheled-zaram  fair  and  wonderful!’  said  Gimli.  ‘There \\nlies  the  Crown  of  Durin  till  he  wakes.  Farewell!’  He  bowed, \\nand  turned  away,  and  hastened  back  up  the  greensward  to \\nthe  road  again. \\n\\n‘What  did  you  see?’  said  Pippin  to  Sam,  but  Sam  was  too \\ndeep  in  thought  to  answer. \\n\\nThe  road  now  turned  south  and  went  quickly  downwards, \\nrunning  out  from  between  the  arms  of  the  dale.  Some  way \\nbelow  the  mere  they  came  on  a  deep  well  of  water,  clear  as \\ncrystal,  from  which  a  freshet  fell  over  a  stone  lip  and  ran \\nglistening  and  gurgling  down  a  steep  rocky  channel. \\n\\n‘Here  is  the  spring  from  which  the  Silverlode  rises,’  said \\nGimli.  ‘Do  not  drink  of  it!  It  is  icy  cold.’ \\n\\n‘Soon  it  becomes  a  swift  river,  and  it  gathers  water  from \\nmany  other  mountain-streams,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘Our  road \\nleads  beside  it  for  many  miles.  For  I  shall  take  you  by  the \\nroad  that  Gandalf  chose,  and  first  I  hope  to  come  to  the \\nwoods  where  the  Silverlode  flows  into  the  Great  River  -  out \\nyonder.’  They  looked  as  he  pointed,  and  before  them  they \\ncould  see  the  stream  leaping  down  to  the  trough  of  the  valley, \\nand  then  running  on  and  away  into  the  lower  lands,  until  it \\nwas  lost  in  a  golden  haze. \\n\\n‘There  lie  the  woods  of  Lothlorien!’  said  Legolas.  ‘That  is \\nthe  fairest  of  all  the  dwellings  of  my  people.  There  are  no \\ntrees  like  the  trees  of  that  land.  For  in  the  autumn  their  leaves \\nfall  not,  but  turn  to  gold.  Not  till  the  spring  comes  and  the \\nnew  green  opens  do  they  fall,  and  then  the  boughs  are  laden \\nwith  yellow  flowers;  and  the  floor  of  the  wood  is  golden,  and \\ngolden  is  the  roof,  and  its  pillars  are  of  silver,  for  the  bark  of \\nthe  trees  is  smooth  and  grey.  So  still  our  songs  in  Mirkwood \\n\\n\\n436  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nsay.  My  heart  would  be  glad  if  I  were  beneath  the  eaves  of \\nthat  wood,  and  it  were  springtime!’ \\n\\n‘My  heart  will  be  glad,  even  in  the  winter,’  said  Aragorn. \\n‘But  it  lies  many  miles  away.  Let  us  hasten!’ \\n\\nFor  some  time  Frodo  and  Sam  managed  to  keep  up  with \\nthe  others;  but  Aragorn  was  leading  them  at  a  great  pace, \\nand  after  a  while  they  lagged  behind.  They  had  eaten  nothing \\nsince  the  early  morning.  Sam’s  cut  was  burning  like  fire,  and \\nhis  head  felt  light.  In  spite  of  the  shining  sun  the  wind  seemed \\nchill  after  the  warm  darkness  of  Moria.  He  shivered.  Frodo \\nfelt  every  step  more  painful  and  he  gasped  for  breath. \\n\\nAt  last  Legolas  turned,  and  seeing  them  now  far  behind, \\nhe  spoke  to  Aragorn.  The  others  halted,  and  Aragorn  ran \\nback,  calling  to  Boromir  to  come  with  him. \\n\\n‘I  am  sorry,  Frodo!’  he  cried,  full  of  concern.  ‘So  much  has \\nhappened  this  day  and  we  have  such  need  of  haste,  that  I \\nhave  forgotten  that  you  were  hurt;  and  Sam  too.  You  should \\nhave  spoken.  We  have  done  nothing  to  ease  you,  as  we  ought, \\nthough  all  the  ores  of  Moria  were  after  us.  Come  now!  A \\nlittle  further  on  there  is  a  place  where  we  can  rest  for  a  little. \\nThere  I  will  do  what  I  can  for  you.  Come,  Boromir!  We  will \\ncarry  them.’ \\n\\nSoon  afterwards  they  came  upon  another  stream  that  ran \\ndown  from  the  west,  and  joined  its  bubbling  water  with \\nthe  hurrying  Silverlode.  Together  they  plunged  over  a  fall \\nof  green-hued  stone,  and  foamed  down  into  a  dell.  About \\nit  stood  fir-trees,  short  and  bent,  and  its  sides  were  steep \\nand  clothed  with  harts-tongue  and  shrubs  of  whortle-berry. \\nAt  the  bottom  there  was  a  level  space  through  which  the \\nstream  flowed  noisily  over  shining  pebbles.  Here  they  rested. \\nIt  was  now  nearly  three  hours  after  noon,  and  they  had  come \\nonly  a  few  miles  from  the  Gates.  Already  the  sun  was \\nwestering. \\n\\nWhile  Gimli  and  the  two  younger  hobbits  kindled  a  fire  of \\nbrush-  and  fir-wood,  and  drew  water,  Aragorn  tended  Sam \\nand  Frodo.  Sam’s  wound  was  not  deep,  but  it  looked  ugly, \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN  437 \\n\\nand  Aragorn’s  face  was  grave  as  he  examined  it.  After  a \\nmoment  he  looked  up  with  relief. \\n\\n‘Good  luck,  Sam!’  he  said.  ‘Many  have  received  worse  than \\nthis  in  payment  for  the  slaying  of  their  first  ore.  The  cut  is \\nnot  poisoned,  as  the  wounds  of  ore-blades  too  often  are.  It \\nshould  heal  well  when  I  have  tended  it.  Bathe  it  when  Gimli \\nhas  heated  water.’ \\n\\nHe  opened  his  pouch  and  drew  out  some  withered  leaves. \\n‘They  are  dry,  and  some  of  their  virtue  has  gone,’  he  said, \\n‘but  here  I  have  still  some  of  the  leaves  of  athelas  that  I \\ngathered  near  Weathertop.  Crush  one  in  the  water,  and  wash \\nthe  wound  clean,  and  I  will  bind  it.  Now  it  is  your  turn, \\nFrodo!’ \\n\\n‘I  am  all  right,’  said  Frodo,  reluctant  to  have  his  garments \\ntouched.  ‘All  I  needed  was  some  food  and  a  little  rest.’ \\n\\n‘No!’  said  Aragorn.  ‘We  must  have  a  look  and  see  what \\nthe  hammer  and  the  anvil  have  done  to  you.  I  still  marvel \\nthat  you  are  alive  at  all.’  Gently  he  stripped  off  Frodo’s \\nold  jacket  and  worn  tunic,  and  gave  a  gasp  of  wonder. \\nThen  he  laughed.  The  silver  corslet  shimmered  before  his \\neyes  like  the  light  upon  a  rippling  sea.  Carefully  he  took  it \\noff  and  held  it  up,  and  the  gems  on  it  glittered  like  stars,  and \\nthe  sound  of  the  shaken  rings  was  like  the  tinkle  of  rain  in  a \\npool. \\n\\n‘Look,  my  friends!’  he  called.  ‘Here’s  a  pretty  hobbit-skin \\nto  wrap  an  elven-princeling  in!  If  it  were  known  that  hobbits \\nhad  such  hides,  all  the  hunters  of  Middle-earth  would  be \\nriding  to  the  Shire.’ \\n\\n‘And  all  the  arrows  of  all  the  hunters  in  the  world  would \\nbe  in  vain,’  said  Gimli,  gazing  at  the  mail  in  wonder.  ‘It  is  a \\nmithril-coat.  Mithril!  I  have  never  seen  or  heard  tell  of  one \\nso  fair.  Is  this  the  coat  that  Gandalf  spoke  of?  Then  he \\nundervalued  it.  But  it  was  well  given!’ \\n\\n‘I  have  often  wondered  what  you  and  Bilbo  were  doing,  so \\nclose  in  his  little  room,’  said  Merry.  ‘Bless  the  old  hobbit!  I \\nlove  him  more  than  ever.  I  hope  we  get  a  chance  of  telling \\nhim  about  it!  ’ \\n\\n\\n438 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nThere  was  a  dark  and  blackened  bruise  on  Frodo’s  right \\nside  and  breast.  Under  the  mail  there  was  a  shirt  of  soft \\nleather,  but  at  one  point  the  rings  had  been  driven  through  it \\ninto  the  flesh.  Frodo’s  left  side  also  was  scored  and  bruised \\nwhere  he  had  been  hurled  against  the  wall.  While  the  others \\nset  the  food  ready,  Aragorn  bathed  the  hurts  with  water  in \\nwhich  athelas  was  steeped.  The  pungent  fragrance  filled  the \\ndell,  and  all  those  who  stooped  over  the  steaming  water  felt \\nrefreshed  and  strengthened.  Soon  Frodo  felt  the  pain  leave \\nhim,  and  his  breath  grew  easy:  though  he  was  stiff  and  sore \\nto  the  touch  for  many  days.  Aragorn  bound  some  soft  pads \\nof  cloth  at  his  side. \\n\\n‘The  mail  is  marvellously  light,’  he  said.  ‘Put  it  on  again, \\nif  you  can  bear  it.  My  heart  is  glad  to  know  that  you  have \\nsuch  a  coat.  Do  not  lay  it  aside,  even  in  sleep,  unless  fortune \\nbrings  you  where  you  are  safe  for  a  while;  and  that  will  seldom \\nchance  while  your  quest  lasts.’ \\n\\nWhen  they  had  eaten,  the  Company  got  ready  to  go  on. \\nThey  put  out  the  fire  and  hid  all  traces  of  it.  Then  climbing \\nout  of  the  dell  they  took  to  the  road  again.  They  had  not  gone \\nfar  before  the  sun  sank  behind  the  westward  heights  and  great \\nshadows  crept  down  the  mountain-sides.  Dusk  veiled  their \\nfeet,  and  mist  rose  in  the  hollows.  Away  in  the  east  the \\nevening  light  lay  pale  upon  the  dim  lands  of  distant  plain \\nand  wood.  Sam  and  Frodo  now  feeling  eased  and  greatly \\nrefreshed  were  able  to  go  at  a  fair  pace,  and  with  only  one \\nbrief  halt  Aragorn  led  the  Company  on  for  nearly  three  more \\nhours. \\n\\nIt  was  dark.  Deep  night  had  fallen.  There  were  many  clear \\nstars,  but  the  fast-waning  moon  would  not  be  seen  till  late. \\nGimli  and  Frodo  were  at  the  rear,  walking  softly  and  not \\nspeaking,  listening  for  any  sound  upon  the  road  behind.  At \\nlength  Gimli  broke  the  silence. \\n\\n‘Not  a  sound  but  the  wind,’  he  said.  ‘There  are  no  goblins \\nnear,  or  my  ears  are  made  of  wood.  It  is  to  be  hoped  that  the \\nOres  will  be  content  with  driving  us  from  Moria.  And  maybe \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN \\n\\n\\n439 \\n\\n\\nthat  was  all  their  purpose,  and  they  had  nothing  else  to  do \\nwith  us  -  with  the  Ring.  Though  Ores  will  often  pursue  foes \\nfor  many  leagues  into  the  plain,  if  they  have  a  fallen  captain \\nto  avenge.’ \\n\\nFrodo  did  not  answer.  He  looked  at  Sting,  and  the  blade \\nwas  dull.  Yet  he  had  heard  something,  or  thought  he  had.  As \\nsoon  as  the  shadows  had  fallen  about  them  and  the  road \\nbehind  was  dim,  he  had  heard  again  the  quick  patter  of  feet. \\nEven  now  he  heard  it.  He  turned  swiftly.  There  were  two \\ntiny  gleams  of  light  behind,  or  for  a  moment  he  thought  he \\nsaw  them,  but  at  once  they  slipped  aside  and  vanished. \\n\\n‘What  is  it?’  said  the  dwarf. \\n\\n‘I  don’t  know,’  answered  Frodo.  ‘I  thought  I  heard  feet, \\nand  I  thought  I  saw  a  light  -  like  eyes.  I  have  thought  so \\noften,  since  we  first  entered  Moria.’ \\n\\nGimli  halted  and  stooped  to  the  ground.  ‘I  hear  nothing \\nbut  the  night-speech  of  plant  and  stone,’  he  said.  ‘Come!  Let \\nus  hurry!  The  others  are  out  of  sight.’ \\n\\nThe  night- wind  blew  chill  up  the  valley  to  meet  them. \\nBefore  them  a  wide  grey  shadow  loomed,  and  they  heard  an \\nendless  rustle  of  leaves  like  poplars  in  the  breeze. \\n\\n‘Lothlorien!’  cried  Legolas.  ‘Lothlorien!  We  have  come  to \\nthe  eaves  of  the  Golden  Wood.  Alas  that  it  is  winter!’ \\n\\nUnder  the  night  the  trees  stood  tall  before  them,  arched \\nover  the  road  and  stream  that  ran  suddenly  beneath  their \\nspreading  boughs.  In  the  dim  light  of  the  stars  their  stems \\nwere  grey,  and  their  quivering  leaves  a  hint  of  fallow  gold. \\n\\n‘Lothlorien!’  said  Aragorn.  ‘Glad  I  am  to  hear  again  the \\nwind  in  the  trees!  We  are  still  little  more  than  five  leagues \\nfrom  the  Gates,  but  we  can  go  no  further.  Here  let  us  hope \\nthat  the  virtue  of  the  Elves  will  keep  us  tonight  from  the  peril \\nthat  comes  behind.’ \\n\\n‘If  Elves  indeed  still  dwell  here  in  the  darkening  world,’ \\nsaid  Gimli. \\n\\n‘It  is  long  since  any  of  my  own  folic  journeyed  hither \\nback  to  the  land  whence  we  wandered  in  ages  long  ago,’ \\n\\n\\n440 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nsaid  Legolas,  ‘but  we  hear  that  Lorien  is  not  yet  deserted, \\nfor  there  is  a  secret  power  here  that  holds  evil  from  the \\nland.  Nevertheless  its  folk  are  seldom  seen,  and  maybe  they \\ndwell  now  deep  in  the  woods  and  far  from  the  northern \\nborder.’ \\n\\n‘Indeed  deep  in  the  wood  they  dwell,’  said  Aragorn,  and \\nsighed  as  if  some  memory  stirred  in  him.  ‘We  must  fend  for \\nourselves  tonight.  We  will  go  forward  a  short  way,  until  the \\ntrees  are  all  about  us,  and  then  we  will  turn  aside  from  the \\npath  and  seek  a  place  to  rest  in.’ \\n\\nHe  stepped  forward;  but  Boromir  stood  irresolute  and  did \\nnot  follow.  ‘Is  there  no  other  way?’  he  said. \\n\\n‘What  other  fairer  way  would  you  desire?’  said  Aragorn. \\n\\n‘A  plain  road,  though  it  led  through  a  hedge  of  swords,’ \\nsaid  Boromir.  ‘By  strange  paths  has  this  Company  been  led, \\nand  so  far  to  evil  fortune.  Against  my  will  we  passed  under \\nthe  shades  of  Moria,  to  our  loss.  And  now  we  must  enter  the \\nGolden  Wood,  you  say.  But  of  that  perilous  land  we  have \\nheard  in  Gondor,  and  it  is  said  that  few  come  out  who  once \\ngo  in;  and  of  that  few  none  have  escaped  unscathed.’ \\n\\n‘Say  not  unscathed ,  but  if  you  say  unchanged ,  then  maybe \\nyou  will  speak  the  truth,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘But  lore  wanes  in \\nGondor,  Boromir,  if  in  the  city  of  those  who  once  were  wise \\nthey  now  speak  evil  of  Lothlorien.  Believe  what  you  will, \\nthere  is  no  other  way  for  us  -  unless  you  would  go  back  to \\nMoria-gate,  or  scale  the  pathless  mountains,  or  swim  the \\nGreat  River  all  alone.’ \\n\\n‘Then  lead  on!’  said  Boromir.  ‘But  it  is  perilous.’ \\n\\n‘Perilous  indeed,’  said  Aragorn,  ‘fair  and  perilous;  but  only \\nevil  need  fear  it,  or  those  who  bring  some  evil  with  them. \\nFollow  me!’ \\n\\nThey  had  gone  little  more  than  a  mile  into  the  forest  when \\nthey  came  upon  another  stream  flowing  down  swiftly  from \\nthe  tree-clad  slopes  that  climbed  back  westward  towards  the \\nmountains.  They  heard  it  splashing  over  a  fall  away  among \\nthe  shadows  on  their  right.  Its  dark  hurrying  waters  ran  across \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN  44 1 \\n\\nthe  path  before  them,  and  joined  the  Silverlode  in  a  swirl  of \\ndim  pools  among  the  roots  of  trees. \\n\\n‘Here  is  Nimrodel!’  said  Legolas.  ‘Of  this  stream  the  Silvan \\nElves  made  many  songs  long  ago,  and  still  we  sing  them  in \\nthe  North,  remembering  the  rainbow  on  its  falls,  and  the \\ngolden  flowers  that  floated  in  its  foam.  All  is  dark  now  and \\nthe  Bridge  of  Nimrodel  is  broken  down.  I  will  bathe  my  feet, \\nfor  it  is  said  that  the  water  is  healing  to  the  weary.’  He  went \\nforward  and  climbed  down  the  deep-cloven  bank  and  stepped \\ninto  the  stream. \\n\\n‘Follow  me!’  he  cried.  ‘The  water  is  not  deep.  Let  us  wade \\nacross!  On  the  further  bank  we  can  rest,  and  the  sound  of \\nthe  falling  water  may  bring  us  sleep  and  forgetfulness  of \\ngrief.’ \\n\\nOne  by  one  they  climbed  down  and  followed  Legolas.  For \\na  moment  Frodo  stood  near  the  brink  and  let  the  water  flow \\nover  his  tired  feet.  It  was  cold  but  its  touch  was  clean,  and  as \\nhe  went  on  and  it  mounted  to  his  knees,  he  felt  that  the  stain \\nof  travel  and  all  weariness  was  washed  from  his  limbs. \\n\\nWhen  all  the  Company  had  crossed,  they  sat  and  rested \\nand  ate  a  little  food;  and  Legolas  told  them  tales  of  Lothlorien \\nthat  the  Elves  of  Mirkwood  still  kept  in  their  hearts,  of  sun¬ \\nlight  and  starlight  upon  the  meadows  by  the  Great  River \\nbefore  the  world  was  grey. \\n\\nAt  length  a  silence  fell,  and  they  heard  the  music  of  the \\nwaterfall  running  sweetly  in  the  shadows.  Almost  Frodo \\nfancied  that  he  could  hear  a  voice  singing,  mingled  with \\nthe  sound  of  the  water. \\n\\n‘Do  you  hear  the  voice  of  Nimrodel?’  asked  Legolas.  ‘I  will \\nsing  you  a  song  of  the  maiden  Nimrodel,  who  bore  the  same \\nname  as  the  stream  beside  which  she  lived  long  ago.  It  is  a \\nfair  song  in  our  woodland  tongue;  but  this  is  how  it  runs  in \\nthe  Westron  Speech,  as  some  in  Rivendell  now  sing  it.’  In  a \\nsoft  voice  hardly  to  be  heard  amid  the  rustle  of  the  leaves \\nabove  them  he  began: \\n\\n\\n442 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nAn  Elven-maid  there  was  of  old, \\n\\nA  shining  star  by  day: \\n\\nHer  mantle  white  was  hemmed  with  gold, \\nHer  shoes  of  silver-grey. \\n\\nA  star  was  bound  upon  her  brows, \\n\\nA  light  was  on  her  hair \\n\\nAs  sun  upon  the  golden  boughs \\nIn  Lorien  the  fair. \\n\\nHer  hair  was  long,  her  limbs  were  white, \\nAnd  fair  she  was  and  free; \\n\\nAnd  in  the  wind  she  went  as  light \\nAs  leaf  of  linden-tree. \\n\\nBeside  the  falls  of  Nimrodel, \\n\\nBy  water  clear  and  cool, \\n\\nHer  voice  as  falling  silver  fell \\nInto  the  shining  pool. \\n\\nWhere  now  she  wanders  none  can  tell, \\n\\nIn  sunlight  or  in  shade; \\n\\nFor  lost  of  yore  was  Nimrodel \\nAnd  in  the  mountains  strayed. \\n\\nThe  elven-ship  in  haven  grey \\nBeneath  the  mountain-lee \\n\\nAwaited  her  for  many  a  day \\nBeside  the  roaring  sea. \\n\\nA  wind  by  night  in  Northern  lands \\nArose,  and  loud  it  cried, \\n\\nAnd  drove  the  ship  from  elven-strands \\nAcross  the  streaming  tide. \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN \\n\\n\\n443 \\n\\n\\nWhen  dawn  came  dim  the  land  was  lost, \\n\\nThe  mountains  sinking  grey \\n\\nBeyond  the  heaving  waves  that  tossed \\nTheir  plumes  of  blinding  spray. \\n\\nAmroth  beheld  the  fading  shore \\nNow  low  beyond  the  swell, \\n\\nAnd  cursed  the  faithless  ship  that  bore \\nHim  far  from  Nimrodel. \\n\\nOf  old  he  was  an  Elven-king, \\n\\nA  lord  of  tree  and  glen, \\n\\nWhen  golden  were  the  boughs  in  spring \\nIn  fair  Lothlorien. \\n\\nFrom  helm  to  sea  they  saw  him  leap, \\n\\nAs  arrow  from  the  string, \\n\\nAnd  dive  into  the  water  deep, \\n\\nAs  mew  upon  the  wing. \\n\\nThe  wind  was  in  his  flowing  hair, \\n\\nThe  foam  about  him  shone; \\n\\nAfar  they  saw  him  strong  and  fair \\nGo  riding  like  a  swan. \\n\\nBut  from  the  West  has  come  no  word, \\n\\nAnd  on  the  Hither  Shore \\n\\nNo  tidings  Elven-folk  have  heard \\nOf  Amroth  evermore. \\n\\nThe  voice  of  Legolas  faltered,  and  the  song  ceased.  ‘I  can¬ \\nnot  sing  any  more,’  he  said.  ‘That  is  but  a  part,  for  I  have \\nforgotten  much.  It  is  long  and  sad,  for  it  tells  how  sorrow \\ncame  upon  Lothlorien,  Lorien  of  the  Blossom,  when  the \\nDwarves  awakened  evil  in  the  mountains.’ \\n\\n‘But  the  Dwarves  did  not  make  the  evil,’  said  Gimli. \\n\\n‘I  said  not  so;  yet  evil  came,’  answered  Legolas  sadly.  ‘Then \\n\\n\\n444 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nmany  of  the  Elves  of  Nimrodel’s  kindred  left  their  dwellings \\nand  departed,  and  she  was  lost  far  in  the  South,  in  the  passes \\nof  the  White  Mountains;  and  she  came  not  to  the  ship  where \\nAmroth  her  lover  waited  for  her.  But  in  the  spring  when  the \\nwind  is  in  the  new  leaves  the  echo  of  her  voice  may  still  be \\nheard  by  the  falls  that  bear  her  name.  And  when  the  wind  is \\nin  the  South  the  voice  of  Amroth  comes  up  from  the  sea;  for \\nNimrodel  flows  into  Silverlode,  that  Elves  call  Celebrant,  and \\nCelebrant  into  Anduin  the  Great,  and  Anduin  flows  into  the \\nBay  of  Belfalas  whence  the  Elves  of  Lorien  set  sail.  But \\nneither  Nimrodel  nor  Amroth  came  ever  back. \\n\\n‘It  is  told  that  she  had  a  house  built  in  the  branches  of  a \\ntree  that  grew  near  the  falls;  for  that  was  the  custom  of  the \\nElves  of  Lorien,  to  dwell  in  the  trees,  and  maybe  it  is  so  still. \\nTherefore  they  were  called  the  Galadhrim,  the  Tree-people. \\nDeep  in  their  forest  the  trees  are  very  great.  The  people  of \\nthe  woods  did  not  delve  in  the  ground  like  Dwarves,  nor \\nbuild  strong  places  of  stone  before  the  Shadow  came.’ \\n\\n‘And  even  in  these  latter  days  dwelling  in  the  trees  might \\nbe  thought  safer  than  sitting  on  the  ground,’  said  Gimli.  He \\nlooked  across  the  stream  to  the  road  that  led  back  to  Dimrill \\nDale,  and  then  up  into  the  roof  of  dark  boughs  above. \\n\\n‘Your  words  bring  good  counsel,  Gimli,’  said  Aragorn. \\n‘We  cannot  build  a  house,  but  tonight  we  will  do  as  the \\nGaladhrim  and  seek  refuge  in  the  tree-tops,  if  we  can.  We \\nhave  sat  here  beside  the  road  already  longer  than  was  wise.’ \\n\\nThe  Company  now  turned  aside  from  the  path,  and  went \\ninto  the  shadow  of  the  deeper  woods,  westward  along  the \\nmountain-stream  away  from  Silverlode.  Not  far  from  the  falls \\nof  Nimrodel  they  found  a  cluster  of  trees,  some  of  which \\noverhung  the  stream.  Their  great  grey  trunks  were  of  mighty \\ngirth,  but  their  height  could  not  be  guessed. \\n\\n‘I  will  climb  up,’  said  Legolas.  ‘I  am  at  home  among  trees, \\nby  root  or  bough,  though  these  trees  are  of  a  kind  strange  to \\nme,  save  as  a  name  in  song.  Mellyrn  they  are  called,  and  are \\nthose  that  bear  the  yellow  blossom,  but  I  have  never  climbed \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN \\n\\n\\n445 \\n\\n\\nin  one.  I  will  see  now  what  is  their  shape  and  way  of  growth.’ \\n\\n‘Whatever  it  may  be,’  said  Pippin,  ‘they  will  be  marvellous \\ntrees  indeed  if  they  can  offer  any  rest  at  night,  except  to  birds. \\nI  cannot  sleep  on  a  perch!’ \\n\\n‘Then  dig  a  hole  in  the  ground,’  said  Legolas,  ‘if  that  is  more \\nafter  the  fashion  of  your  kind.  But  you  must  dig  swift  and  deep, \\nif  you  wish  to  hide  from  Ores.’  He  sprang  lightly  up  from  the \\nground  and  caught  a  branch  that  grew  from  the  trunk  high \\nabove  his  head.  But  even  as  he  swung  there  for  a  moment,  a \\nvoice  spoke  suddenly  from  the  tree-shadows  above  him. \\n\\n‘ Daro!’  it  said  in  commanding  tone,  and  Legolas  dropped \\nback  to  earth  in  surprise  and  fear.  He  shrank  against  the  bole \\nof  the  tree. \\n\\n‘Stand  still!’  he  whispered  to  the  others.  ‘Do  not  move  or \\nspeak!’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  sound  of  soft  laughter  over  their  heads,  and \\nthen  another  clear  voice  spoke  in  an  elven-tongue.  Frodo \\ncould  understand  little  of  what  was  said,  for  the  speech  that \\nthe  Silvan  folk  east  of  the  mountains  used  among  themselves \\nwas  unlike  that  of  the  West.  Legolas  looked  up  and  answered \\nin  the  same  language.* \\n\\nWho  are  they,  and  what  do  they  say?’  asked  Merry. \\n\\n‘They’re  Elves,’  said  Sam.  ‘Can’t  you  hear  their  voices?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  they  are  Elves,’  said  Legolas;  ‘and  they  say  that  you \\nbreathe  so  loud  that  they  could  shoot  you  in  the  dark.’  Sam \\nhastily  put  his  hand  over  his  mouth.  ‘But  they  say  also  that \\nyou  need  have  no  fear.  They  have  been  aware  of  us  for  a \\nlong  while.  They  heard  my  voice  across  the  Nimrodel,  and \\nknew  that  I  was  one  of  their  Northern  kindred,  and  therefore \\nthey  did  not  hinder  our  crossing;  and  afterwards  they  heard \\nmy  song.  Now  they  bid  me  climb  up  with  Frodo;  for  they \\nseem  to  have  had  some  tidings  of  him  and  of  our  journey. \\nThe  others  they  ask  to  wait  a  little,  and  to  keep  watch  at  the \\nfoot  of  the  tree,  until  they  have  decided  what  is  to  be  done.’ \\n\\n*  *  * \\n\\n\\n*  See  note  in  Appendix  F:  Of  the  Elves. \\n\\n\\n446  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nOut  of  the  shadows  a  ladder  was  let  down:  it  was  made  of \\nrope,  silver-grey  and  glimmering  in  the  dark,  and  though  it \\nlooked  slender  it  proved  strong  enough  to  bear  many  men. \\nLegolas  ran  lightly  up,  and  Frodo  followed  slowly;  behind \\ncame  Sam  trying  not  to  breathe  loudly.  The  branches  of  the \\nmallorn-tree  grew  out  nearly  straight  from  the  trunk,  and \\nthen  swept  upward;  but  near  the  top  the  main  stem  divided \\ninto  a  crown  of  many  boughs,  and  among  these  they  found \\nthat  there  had  been  built  a  wooden  platform,  or  jiet  as  such \\nthings  were  called  in  those  days:  the  Elves  called  it  a  talan.  It \\nwas  reached  by  a  round  hole  in  the  centre  through  which  the \\nladder  passed. \\n\\nWhen  Frodo  came  at  last  up  on  to  the  flet  he  found  Legolas \\nseated  with  three  other  Elves.  They  were  clad  in  shadowy- \\ngrey,  and  could  not  be  seen  among  the  tree-stems,  unless \\nthey  moved  suddenly.  They  stood  up,  and  one  of  them \\nuncovered  a  small  lamp  that  gave  out  a  slender  silver  beam. \\nHe  held  it  up,  looking  at  Frodo’s  face,  and  Sam’s.  Then  he \\nshut  off  the  light  again,  and  spoke  words  of  welcome  in  his \\nelven-tongue.  Frodo  spoke  haltingly  in  return. \\n\\nWelcome!’  the  Elf  then  said  again  in  the  Common  Lan¬ \\nguage,  speaking  slowly.  We  seldom  use  any  tongue  but  our \\nown;  for  we  dwell  now  in  the  heart  of  the  forest,  and  do  not \\nwillingly  have  dealings  with  any  other  folk.  Even  our  own \\nkindred  in  the  North  are  sundered  from  us.  But  there  are \\nsome  of  us  still  who  go  abroad  for  the  gathering  of  news  and \\nthe  watching  of  our  enemies,  and  they  speak  the  languages \\nof  other  lands.  I  am  one.  Haldir  is  my  name.  My  brothers, \\nRumil  and  Orophin,  speak  little  of  your  tongue. \\n\\n‘But  we  have  heard  rumours  of  your  coming,  for  the  mess¬ \\nengers  of  Elrond  passed  by  Lorien  on  their  way  home  up  the \\nDimrill  Stair.  We  had  not  heard  of  -  hobbits,  of  halflings,  for \\nmany  a  long  year,  and  did  not  know  that  any  yet  dwelt  in \\nMiddle-earth.  You  do  not  look  evil!  And  since  you  come  with \\nan  Elf  of  our  kindred,  we  are  willing  to  befriend  you,  as  Elrond \\nasked;  though  it  is  not  our  custom  to  lead  strangers  through \\nour  land.  But  you  must  stay  here  tonight.  How  many  are  you?’ \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN \\n\\n\\n447 \\n\\n\\n‘Eight,’  said  Legolas.  ‘Myself,  four  hobbits;  and  two  men, \\none  of  whom,  Aragorn,  is  an  Elf-friend  of  the  folk  of \\nWesternesse.’ \\n\\n‘The  name  of  Aragorn  son  of  Arathorn  is  known  in  Lorien,’ \\nsaid  Haldir,  ‘and  he  has  the  favour  of  the  Lady.  All  then  is \\nwell.  But  you  have  yet  spoken  only  of  seven.’ \\n\\n‘The  eighth  is  a  dwarf,’  said  Legolas. \\n\\n‘A  dwarf!’  said  Haldir.  ‘That  is  not  well.  We  have  not  had \\ndealings  with  the  Dwarves  since  the  Dark  Days.  They  are \\nnot  permitted  in  our  land.  I  cannot  allow  him  to  pass.’ \\n\\n‘But  he  is  from  the  Lonely  Mountain,  one  of  Dain’s  trusty \\npeople,  and  friendly  to  Elrond,’  said  Frodo.  ‘Elrond  himself \\nchose  him  to  be  one  of  our  companions,  and  he  has  been \\nbrave  and  faithful.’ \\n\\nThe  Elves  spoke  together  in  soft  voices,  and  questioned \\nLegolas  in  their  own  tongue.  ‘Very  good,’  said  Haldir  at  last. \\n‘We  will  do  this,  though  it  is  against  our  liking.  If  Aragorn \\nand  Legolas  will  guard  him,  and  answer  for  him,  he  shall \\npass;  but  he  must  go  blindfold  through  Lothlorien. \\n\\n‘But  now  we  must  debate  no  longer.  Your  folic  must  not \\nremain  on  the  ground.  We  have  been  keeping  watch  on  the \\nrivers,  ever  since  we  saw  a  great  troop  of  Ores  going  north \\ntowards  Moria,  along  the  skirts  of  the  mountains,  many  days \\nago.  Wolves  are  howling  on  the  wood’s  borders.  If  you  have \\nindeed  come  from  Moria,  the  peril  cannot  be  far  behind. \\nTomorrow  early  you  must  go  on. \\n\\n‘The  four  hobbits  shall  climb  up  here  and  stay  with  us  - \\nwe  do  not  fear  them!  There  is  another  talan  in  the  next \\ntree.  There  the  others  must  take  refuge.  You,  Legolas,  must \\nanswer  to  us  for  them.  Call  us,  if  anything  is  amiss!  And  have \\nan  eye  on  that  dwarf!’ \\n\\nLegolas  at  once  went  down  the  ladder  to  take  Haldir’s \\nmessage;  and  soon  afterwards  Merry  and  Pippin  clambered \\nup  on  to  the  high  flet.  They  were  out  of  breath  and  seemed \\nrather  scared. \\n\\n‘There!’  said  Merry  panting.  We  have  lugged  up  your \\n\\n\\n448 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nblankets  as  well  as  our  own.  Strider  has  hidden  all  the  rest  of \\nour  baggage  in  a  deep  drift  of  leaves.’ \\n\\n‘You  had  no  need  of  your  burdens,’  said  Haldir.  ‘It  is  cold \\nin  the  tree-tops  in  winter,  though  the  wind  tonight  is  in  the \\nSouth;  but  we  have  food  and  drink  to  give  you  that  will  drive \\naway  the  night-chill,  and  we  have  skins  and  cloaks  to  spare.’ \\n\\nThe  hobbits  accepted  this  second  (and  far  better)  supper \\nvery  gladly.  Then  they  wrapped  themselves  warmly,  not  only \\nin  the  fur-cloaks  of  the  Elves,  but  in  their  own  blankets  as \\nwell,  and  tried  to  go  to  sleep.  But  weary  as  they  were  only \\nSam  found  that  easy  to  do.  Hobbits  do  not  like  heights,  and \\ndo  not  sleep  upstairs,  even  when  they  have  any  stairs.  The \\nflet  was  not  at  all  to  their  liking  as  a  bedroom.  It  had  no  walls, \\nnot  even  a  rail;  only  on  one  side  was  there  a  light  plaited \\nscreen,  which  could  be  moved  and  fixed  in  different  places \\naccording  to  the  wind. \\n\\nPippin  went  on  talking  for  a  while.  ‘I  hope,  if  I  do  go  to \\nsleep  in  this  bird-loft,  that  I  shan’t  roll  off,’  he  said. \\n\\n‘Once  I  do  get  to  sleep,’  said  Sam,  ‘I  shall  go  on  sleeping, \\nwhether  I  roll  off  or  no.  And  the  less  said,  the  sooner  I’ll  drop \\noff,  if  you  take  my  meaning.’ \\n\\nFrodo  lay  for  some  time  awake,  and  looked  up  at  the  stars \\nglinting  through  the  pale  roof  of  quivering  leaves.  Sam  was \\nsnoring  at  his  side  long  before  he  himself  closed  his  eyes.  He \\ncould  dimly  see  the  grey  forms  of  two  elves  sitting  motionless \\nwith  their  arms  about  their  knees,  speaking  in  whispers.  The \\nother  had  gone  down  to  take  up  his  watch  on  one  of  the  lower \\nbranches.  At  last  lulled  by  the  wind  in  the  boughs  above,  and \\nthe  sweet  murmur  of  the  falls  of  Nimrodel  below,  Frodo  fell \\nasleep  with  the  song  of  Legolas  running  in  his  mind. \\n\\nLate  in  the  night  he  woke.  The  other  hobbits  were  asleep. \\nThe  Elves  were  gone.  The  sickle  Moon  was  gleaming  dimly \\namong  the  leaves.  The  wind  was  still.  A  little  way  off  he  heard \\na  harsh  laugh  and  the  tread  of  many  feet  on  the  ground \\nbelow.  There  was  a  ring  of  metal.  The  sounds  died  slowly \\naway,  and  seemed  to  go  southward,  on  into  the  wood. \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN \\n\\n\\n449 \\n\\n\\nA  head  appeared  suddenly  through  the  hole  in  the  flet. \\nFrodo  sat  up  in  alarm  and  saw  that  it  was  a  grey-hooded  Elf. \\nHe  looked  towards  the  hobbits. \\n\\n‘What  is  it?’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Yrch!’  said  the  Elf  in  a  hissing  whisper,  and  cast  on  to  the \\nflet  the  rope-ladder  rolled  up. \\n\\n‘Ores!’  said  Frodo.  ‘What  are  they  doing?’  But  the  Elf  had \\ngone. \\n\\nThere  were  no  more  sounds.  Even  the  leaves  were  silent, \\nand  the  very  falls  seemed  to  be  hushed.  Frodo  sat  and  shiv¬ \\nered  in  his  wraps.  He  was  thankful  that  they  had  not  been \\ncaught  on  the  ground;  but  he  felt  that  the  trees  offered  little \\nprotection,  except  concealment.  Ores  were  as  keen  as  hounds \\non  a  scent,  it  was  said,  but  they  could  also  climb.  He  drew \\nout  Sting:  it  flashed  and  glittered  like  a  blue  flame;  and  then \\nslowly  faded  again  and  grew  dull.  In  spite  of  the  fading  of  his \\nsword  the  feeling  of  immediate  danger  did  not  leave  Frodo, \\nrather  it  grew  stronger.  He  got  up  and  crawled  to  the  opening \\nand  peered  down.  He  was  almost  certain  that  he  could  hear \\nstealthy  movements  at  the  tree’s  foot  far  below. \\n\\nNot  Elves;  for  the  woodland  folk  were  altogether  noiseless \\nin  their  movements.  Then  he  heard  faintly  a  sound  like \\nsniffing;  and  something  seemed  to  be  scrabbling  on  the  bark \\nof  the  tree-trunk.  He  stared  down  into  the  dark,  holding  his \\nbreath. \\n\\nSomething  was  now  climbing  slowly,  and  its  breath  came \\nlike  a  soft  hissing  through  closed  teeth.  Then  coming  up, \\nclose  to  the  stem,  Frodo  saw  two  pale  eyes.  They  stopped \\nand  gazed  upward  unwinking.  Suddenly  they  turned  away, \\nand  a  shadowy  figure  slipped  round  the  trunk  of  the  tree  and \\nvanished. \\n\\nImmediately  afterwards  Haldir  came  climbing  swiftly  up \\nthrough  the  branches.  ‘There  was  something  in  this  tree  that \\nI  have  never  seen  before,’  he  said.  ‘It  was  not  an  ore.  It  fled \\nas  soon  as  I  touched  the  tree-stem.  It  seemed  to  be  wary,  and \\nto  have  some  skill  in  trees,  or  I  might  have  thought  that  it \\nwas  one  of  you  hobbits. \\n\\n\\n450 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘I  did  not  shoot,  for  I  dared  not  arouse  any  cries:  we  cannot \\nrisk  battle.  A  strong  company  of  Ores  has  passed.  They \\ncrossed  the  Nimrodel  -  curse  their  foul  feet  in  its  clean  water! \\n-  and  went  on  down  the  old  road  beside  the  river.  They \\nseemed  to  pick  up  some  scent,  and  they  searched  the  ground \\nfor  a  while  near  the  place  where  you  halted.  The  three  of  us \\ncould  not  challenge  a  hundred,  so  we  went  ahead  and  spoke \\nwith  feigned  voices,  leading  them  on  into  the  wood. \\n\\n‘Orophin  has  now  gone  in  haste  back  to  our  dwellings  to \\nwarn  our  people.  None  of  the  Ores  will  ever  return  out  of \\nLorien.  And  there  will  be  many  Elves  hidden  on  the  northern \\nborder  before  another  night  falls.  But  you  must  take  the  road \\nsouth  as  soon  as  it  is  fully  light.’ \\n\\nDay  came  pale  from  the  East.  As  the  light  grew  it  filtered \\nthrough  the  yellow  leaves  of  the  mallorn,  and  it  seemed  to \\nthe  hobbits  that  the  early  sun  of  a  cool  summer’s  morning  was \\nshining.  Pale-blue  sky  peeped  among  the  moving  branches. \\nLooking  through  an  opening  on  the  south  side  of  the  flet \\nFrodo  saw  all  the  valley  of  the  Silverlode  lying  like  a  sea  of \\nfallow  gold  tossing  gently  in  the  breeze. \\n\\nThe  morning  was  still  young  and  cold  when  the  Company \\nset  out  again,  guided  now  by  Haldir  and  his  brother  Rumil. \\n‘Farewell,  sweet  Nimrodel!’  cried  Legolas.  Frodo  looked  back \\nand  caught  a  gleam  of  white  foam  among  the  grey  tree-stems. \\n‘Farewell,’  he  said.  It  seemed  to  him  that  he  would  never \\nhear  again  a  running  water  so  beautiful,  for  ever  blending  its \\ninnumerable  notes  in  an  endless  changeful  music. \\n\\nThey  went  back  to  the  path  that  still  went  on  along  the \\nwest  side  of  the  Silverlode,  and  for  some  way  they  followed \\nit  southward.  There  were  the  prints  of  orc-feet  in  the  earth. \\nBut  soon  Haldir  turned  aside  into  the  trees  and  halted  on  the \\nbank  of  the  river  under  their  shadows. \\n\\n‘There  is  one  of  my  people  yonder  across  the  stream,’  he \\nsaid,  ‘though  you  may  not  see  him.’  He  gave  a  call  like  the \\nlow  whistle  of  a  bird,  and  out  of  a  thicket  of  young  trees  an \\nElf  stepped,  clad  in  grey,  but  with  his  hood  thrown  back;  his \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN \\n\\n\\n451 \\n\\n\\nhair  glinted  like  gold  in  the  morning  sun.  Haldir  skilfully  cast \\nover  the  stream  a  coil  of  grey  rope,  and  he  caught  it  and \\nbound  the  end  about  a  tree  near  the  hank. \\n\\n‘Celebrant  is  already  a  strong  stream  here,  as  you  see,’  said \\nHaldir,  ‘and  it  runs  both  swift  and  deep,  and  is  very  cold.  We \\ndo  not  set  foot  in  it  so  far  north,  unless  we  must.  But  in  these \\ndays  of  watchfulness  we  do  not  make  bridges.  This  is  how \\nwe  cross!  Follow  me!’  He  made  his  end  of  the  rope  fast  about \\nanother  tree,  and  then  ran  lightly  along  it,  over  the  river  and \\nback  again,  as  if  he  were  on  a  road. \\n\\n‘I  can  walk  this  path,’  said  Legolas;  ‘but  the  others  have \\nnot  this  skill.  Must  they  swim?’ \\n\\n‘No!’  said  Haldir.  ‘We  have  two  more  ropes.  We  will  fasten \\nthem  above  the  other,  one  shoulder-high,  and  another  half- \\nhigh,  and  holding  these  the  strangers  should  be  able  to  cross \\nwith  care.’ \\n\\nWhen  this  slender  bridge  had  been  made,  the  Company \\npassed  over,  some  cautiously  and  slowly,  others  more  easily. \\nOf  the  hobbits  Pippin  proved  the  best  for  he  was  sure-footed, \\nand  he  walked  over  quickly,  holding  only  with  one  hand;  but \\nhe  kept  his  eyes  on  the  bank  ahead  and  did  not  look  down. \\nSam  shuffled  along,  clutching  hard,  and  looking  down  into \\nthe  pale  eddying  water  as  if  it  was  a  chasm  in  the  mountains. \\n\\nHe  breathed  with  relief  when  he  was  safely  across.  ‘Live \\nand  learn!  as  my  gaffer  used  to  say.  Though  he  was  thinking \\nof  gardening,  not  of  roosting  like  a  bird,  nor  of  trying  to  walk \\nlike  a  spider.  Not  even  my  uncle  Andy  ever  did  a  trick  like \\nthat!’ \\n\\nWhen  at  length  all  the  Company  was  gathered  on  the  east \\nbank  of  the  Silverlode,  the  Elves  untied  the  ropes  and  coiled \\ntwo  of  them.  Rumil,  who  had  remained  on  the  other  side, \\ndrew  back  the  last  one,  slung  it  on  his  shoulder,  and  with  a \\nwave  of  his  hand  went  away,  back  to  Nimrodel  to  keep  watch. \\n\\n‘Now,  friends,’  said  Haldir,  ‘you  have  entered  the  Naith  of \\nLorien,  or  the  Gore,  as  you  would  say,  for  it  is  the  land \\nthat  lies  like  a  spearhead  between  the  arms  of  Silverlode  and \\nAnduin  the  Great.  We  allow  no  strangers  to  spy  out  the \\n\\n\\n452 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nsecrets  of  the  Naith.  Few  indeed  are  permitted  even  to  set \\nfoot  there. \\n\\n‘As  was  agreed,  I  shall  here  blindfold  the  eyes  of  Gimli  the \\nDwarf.  The  others  may  walk  free  for  a  while,  until  we  come \\nnearer  to  our  dwellings,  down  in  Egladil,  in  the  Angle  between \\nthe  waters.’ \\n\\nThis  was  not  at  all  to  the  liking  of  Gimli.  ‘The  agreement  was \\nmade  without  my  consent,’  he  said.  ‘I  will  not  walk  blindfold, \\nlike  a  beggar  or  a  prisoner.  And  I  am  no  spy.  My  folk  have  never \\nhad  dealings  with  any  of  the  servants  of  the  Enemy.  Neither \\nhave  we  done  harm  to  the  Elves.  I  am  no  more  likely  to  betray \\nyou  than  Legolas,  or  any  other  of  my  companions.’ \\n\\n‘I  do  not  doubt  you,’  said  Hal  dir.  ‘Yet  this  is  our  law.  I  am \\nnot  the  master  of  the  law,  and  cannot  set  it  aside.  I  have  done \\nmuch  in  letting  you  set  foot  over  Celebrant.  ’ \\n\\nGimli  was  obstinate.  He  planted  his  feet  firmly  apart,  and \\nlaid  his  hand  upon  the  haft  of  his  axe.  ‘I  will  go  forward  free,’ \\nhe  said,  ‘or  I  will  go  back  and  seek  my  own  land,  where  I \\nam  known  to  be  true  of  word,  though  I  perish  alone  in  the \\nwilderness.’ \\n\\n‘You  cannot  go  back,’  said  Haldir  sternly.  ‘Now  you  have \\ncome  thus  far,  you  must  be  brought  before  the  Lord  and  the \\nLady.  They  shall  judge  you,  to  hold  you  or  to  give  you  leave, \\nas  they  will.  You  cannot  cross  the  rivers  again,  and  behind \\nyou  there  are  now  secret  sentinels  that  you  cannot  pass.  You \\nwould  be  slain  before  you  saw  them.’ \\n\\nGimli  drew  his  axe  from  his  belt.  Haldir  and  his  companion \\nbent  their  bows.  ‘A  plague  on  Dwarves  and  their  stiff  necks!’ \\nsaid  Legolas. \\n\\n‘Come!’  said  Aragorn.  ‘If  I  am  still  to  lead  this  Company, \\nyou  must  do  as  I  bid.  It  is  hard  upon  the  Dwarf  to  be  thus \\nsingled  out.  We  will  all  be  blindfold,  even  Legolas.  That  will \\nbe  best,  though  it  will  make  the  journey  slow  and  dull.’ \\n\\nGimli  laughed  suddenly.  ‘A  merry  troop  of  fools  we  shall \\nlook!  Will  Haldir  lead  us  all  on  a  string,  like  many  blind \\nbeggars  with  one  dog?  But  I  will  be  content,  if  only  Legolas \\nhere  shares  my  blindness.’ \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN  453 \\n\\n‘I  am  an  Elf  and  a  kinsman  here,’  said  Legolas,  becoming \\nangry  in  his  turn. \\n\\n‘Now  let  us  cry:  “a  plague  on  the  stiff  necks  of  Elves!”’ \\nsaid  Aragorn.  ‘But  the  Company  shall  all  fare  alike.  Come, \\nbind  our  eyes,  Haldir!’ \\n\\n‘I  shall  claim  full  amends  for  every  fall  and  stubbed  toe,  if \\nyou  do  not  lead  us  well,’  said  Gimli  as  they  bound  a  cloth \\nabout  his  eyes. \\n\\n‘You  will  have  no  claim,’  said  Haldir.  ‘I  shall  lead  you  well, \\nand  the  paths  are  smooth  and  straight.’ \\n\\n‘Alas  for  the  folly  of  these  days!’  said  Legolas.  ‘Here  all  are \\nenemies  of  the  one  Enemy,  and  yet  I  must  walk  blind,  while \\nthe  sun  is  merry  in  the  woodland  under  leaves  of  gold!’ \\n\\n‘Folly  it  may  seem,’  said  Haldir.  ‘Indeed  in  nothing  is  the \\npower  of  the  Dark  Lord  more  clearly  shown  than  in  the \\nestrangement  that  divides  all  those  who  still  oppose  him.  Yet \\nso  little  faith  and  trust  do  we  find  now  in  the  world  beyond \\nLothlorien,  unless  maybe  in  Rivendell,  that  we  dare  not  by \\nour  own  trust  endanger  our  land.  We  live  now  upon  an  island \\namid  many  perils,  and  our  hands  are  more  often  upon  the \\nbowstring  than  upon  the  harp. \\n\\n‘The  rivers  long  defended  us,  but  they  are  a  sure  guard  no \\nmore;  for  the  Shadow  has  crept  northward  all  about  us.  Some \\nspeak  of  departing,  yet  for  that  it  already  seems  too  late.  The \\nmountains  to  the  west  are  growing  evil;  to  the  east  the  lands \\nare  waste,  and  full  of  Sauron’s  creatures;  and  it  is  rumoured \\nthat  we  cannot  now  safely  pass  southward  through  Rohan, \\nand  the  mouths  of  the  Great  River  are  watched  by  the  Enemy. \\nEven  if  we  could  come  to  the  shores  of  the  Sea,  we  should \\nfind  no  longer  any  shelter  there.  It  is  said  that  there  are  still \\nhavens  of  the  High  Elves,  but  they  are  far  north  and  west, \\nbeyond  the  land  of  the  Halflings.  But  where  that  may  be, \\nthough  the  Lord  and  Lady  may  know,  I  do  not.’ \\n\\n‘You  ought  at  least  to  guess,  since  you  have  seen  us,’  said \\nMerry.  ‘There  are  Elf-havens  west  of  my  land,  the  Shire, \\nwhere  Hobbits  live.’ \\n\\n‘Happy  folk  are  Hobbits  to  dwell  near  the  shores  of  the \\n\\n\\n454 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nsea!’  said  Haldir.  ‘It  is  long  indeed  since  any  of  my  folk  have \\nlooked  on  it,  yet  still  we  remember  it  in  song.  Tell  me  of  these \\nhavens  as  we  walk.  ’ \\n\\n‘I  cannot,’  said  Merry.  ‘I  have  never  seen  them.  I  have \\nnever  been  out  of  my  own  land  before.  And  if  I  had  known \\nwhat  the  world  outside  was  like,  I  don’t  think  I  should  have \\nhad  the  heart  to  leave  it.’ \\n\\n‘Not  even  to  see  fair  Lothlorien?’  said  Haldir.  ‘The  world \\nis  indeed  full  of  peril,  and  in  it  there  are  many  dark  places; \\nbut  still  there  is  much  that  is  fair,  and  though  in  all  lands  love \\nis  now  mingled  with  grief,  it  grows  perhaps  the  greater. \\n\\n‘Some  there  are  among  us  who  sing  that  the  Shadow  will \\ndraw  back,  and  peace  shall  come  again.  Yet  I  do  not  believe \\nthat  the  world  about  us  will  ever  again  be  as  it  was  of  old,  or \\nthe  light  of  the  Sun  as  it  was  aforetime.  For  the  Elves,  I  fear, \\nit  will  prove  at  best  a  truce,  in  which  they  may  pass  to  the \\nSea  unhindered  and  leave  the  Middle-earth  for  ever.  Alas  for \\nLothlorien  that  I  love!  It  would  be  a  poor  life  in  a  land  where \\nno  mallorn  grew.  But  if  there  are  mallorn-trees  beyond  the \\nGreat  Sea,  none  have  reported  it.’ \\n\\nAs  they  spoke  thus,  the  Company  filed  slowly  along  the \\npaths  in  the  wood,  led  by  Haldir,  while  the  other  Elf  walked \\nbehind.  They  felt  the  ground  beneath  their  feet  smooth  and \\nsoft,  and  after  a  while  they  walked  more  freely,  without  fear \\nof  hurt  or  fall.  Being  deprived  of  sight,  Frodo  found  his \\nhearing  and  other  senses  sharpened.  He  could  smell  the  trees \\nand  the  trodden  grass.  He  could  hear  many  different  notes \\nin  the  rustle  of  the  leaves  overhead,  the  river  murmuring \\naway  on  his  right,  and  the  thin  clear  voices  of  birds  high  in \\nthe  sky.  He  felt  the  sun  upon  his  face  and  hands  when  they \\npassed  through  an  open  glade. \\n\\nAs  soon  as  he  set  foot  upon  the  far  bank  of  Silverlode  a \\nstrange  feeling  had  come  upon  him,  and  it  deepened  as  he \\nwalked  on  into  the  Naith:  it  seemed  to  him  that  he  had \\nstepped  over  a  bridge  of  time  into  a  corner  of  the  Elder \\nDays,  and  was  now  walking  in  a  world  that  was  no  more.  In \\nRivendell  there  was  memory  of  ancient  things;  in  Lorien  the \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN \\n\\n\\n455 \\n\\n\\nancient  things  still  lived  on  in  the  waking  world.  Evil  had \\nbeen  seen  and  heard  there,  sorrow  had  been  known;  the  Elves \\nfeared  and  distrusted  the  world  outside:  wolves  were  howling \\non  the  wood’s  borders:  but  on  the  land  of  Lorien  no  shadow \\nlay. \\n\\nAll  that  day  the  Company  marched  on,  until  they  felt  the \\ncool  evening  come  and  heard  the  early  night-wind  whispering \\namong  many  leaves.  Then  they  rested  and  slept  without  fear \\nupon  the  ground;  for  their  guides  would  not  permit  them  to \\nunbind  their  eyes,  and  they  could  not  climb.  In  the  morning \\nthey  went  on  again,  walking  without  haste.  At  noon  they \\nhalted,  and  Frodo  was  aware  that  they  had  passed  out  under \\nthe  shining  Sun.  Suddenly  he  heard  the  sound  of  many  voices \\nall  around  him. \\n\\nA  marching  host  of  Elves  had  come  up  silently:  they  were \\nhastening  towards  the  northern  borders  to  guard  against  any \\nattack  from  Moria;  and  they  brought  news,  some  of  which \\nHaldir  reported.  The  marauding  ores  had  been  waylaid  and \\nalmost  all  destroyed;  the  remnant  had  fled  westward  towards \\nthe  mountains,  and  were  being  pursued.  A  strange  creature \\nalso  had  been  seen,  running  with  bent  back  and  with  hands \\nnear  the  ground,  like  a  beast  and  yet  not  of  beast-shape.  It \\nhad  eluded  capture,  and  they  had  not  shot  it,  not  knowing \\nwhether  it  was  good  or  ill,  and  it  had  vanished  down  the \\nSilverlode  southward. \\n\\n‘Also,’  said  Haldir,  ‘they  bring  me  a  message  from  the  Lord \\nand  Lady  of  the  Galadhrim.  You  are  all  to  walk  free,  even \\nthe  dwarf  Gimli.  It  seems  that  the  Lady  knows  who  and  what \\nis  each  member  of  your  Company.  New  messages  have  come \\nfrom  Rivendell  perhaps.’ \\n\\nHe  removed  the  bandage  first  from  Gimli’s  eyes.  ‘Your \\npardon!’  he  said,  bowing  low.  ‘Look  on  us  now  with  friendly \\neyes!  Look  and  be  glad,  for  you  are  the  first  dwarf  to  behold \\nthe  trees  of  the  Naith  of  Lorien  since  Durin’s  Day!’ \\n\\nWhen  his  eyes  were  in  turn  uncovered,  Frodo  looked  up \\nand  caught  his  breath.  They  were  standing  in  an  open  space. \\n\\n\\n456 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nTo  the  left  stood  a  great  mound,  covered  with  a  sward  of \\ngrass  as  green  as  Springtime  in  the  Elder  Days.  Upon  it,  as \\na  double  crown,  grew  two  circles  of  trees:  the  outer  had  bark \\nof  snowy  white,  and  were  leafless  but  beautiful  in  their \\nshapely  nakedness;  the  inner  were  mallorn-trees  of  great \\nheight,  still  arrayed  in  pale  gold.  High  amid  the  branches  of \\na  towering  tree  that  stood  in  the  centre  of  all  there  gleamed \\na  white  flet.  At  the  feet  of  the  trees,  and  all  about  the  green \\nhillsides  the  grass  was  studded  with  small  golden  flowers \\nshaped  like  stars.  Among  them,  nodding  on  slender  stalks, \\nwere  other  flowers,  white  and  palest  green:  they  glimmered \\nas  a  mist  amid  the  rich  hue  of  the  grass.  Over  all  the  sky  was \\nblue,  and  the  sun  of  afternoon  glowed  upon  the  hill  and  cast \\nlong  green  shadows  beneath  the  trees. \\n\\n‘Behold!  You  are  come  to  Cerin  Amroth,’  said  Haldir.  ‘For \\nthis  is  the  heart  of  the  ancient  realm  as  it  was  long  ago,  and \\nhere  is  the  mound  of  Amroth,  where  in  happier  days  his  high \\nhouse  was  built.  Here  ever  bloom  the  winter  flowers  in  the \\nunfading  grass:  the  yellow  elanor,  and  the  pale  niphredil.  Here \\nwe  will  stay  awhile,  and  come  to  the  city  of  the  Galadhrim \\nat  dusk.’ \\n\\nThe  others  cast  themselves  down  upon  the  fragrant  grass, \\nbut  Frodo  stood  awhile  still  lost  in  wonder.  It  seemed  to  him \\nthat  he  had  stepped  through  a  high  window  that  looked  on  a \\nvanished  world.  A  light  was  upon  it  for  which  his  language \\nhad  no  name.  All  that  he  saw  was  shapely,  but  the  shapes \\nseemed  at  once  clear  cut,  as  if  they  had  been  first  conceived \\nand  drawn  at  the  uncovering  of  his  eyes,  and  ancient  as  if \\nthey  had  endured  for  ever.  He  saw  no  colour  but  those  he \\nknew,  gold  and  white  and  blue  and  green,  but  they  were  fresh \\nand  poignant,  as  if  he  had  at  that  moment  first  perceived \\nthem  and  made  for  them  names  new  and  wonderful.  In  winter \\nhere  no  heart  could  mourn  for  summer  or  for  spring.  No \\nblemish  or  sickness  or  deformity  could  be  seen  in  anything \\nthat  grew  upon  the  earth.  On  the  land  of  Lorien  there  was \\nno  stain. \\n\\n\\nLOTHLORIEN \\n\\n\\n457 \\n\\n\\nHe  turned  and  saw  that  Sam  was  now  standing  beside  him, \\nlooking  round  with  a  puzzled  expression,  and  rubbing  his \\neyes  as  if  he  was  not  sure  that  he  was  awake.  ‘It’s  sunlight \\nand  bright  day,  right  enough,’  he  said.  ‘I  thought  that  Elves \\nwere  all  for  moon  and  stars:  but  this  is  more  Elvish  than \\nanything  I  ever  heard  tell  of.  I  feel  as  if  I  was  inside  a  song,  if \\nyou  take  my  meaning.’ \\n\\nHaldir  looked  at  them,  and  he  seemed  indeed  to  take  the \\nmeaning  of  both  thought  and  word.  He  smiled.  ‘You  feel  the \\npower  of  the  Lady  of  the  Galadhrim,’  he  said.  ‘Would  it \\nplease  you  to  climb  with  me  up  Cerin  Amroth?’ \\n\\nThey  followed  him  as  he  stepped  lightly  up  the  grass-clad \\nslopes.  Though  he  walked  and  breathed,  and  about  him  living \\nleaves  and  flowers  were  stirred  by  the  same  cool  wind  as \\nfanned  his  face,  Frodo  felt  that  he  was  in  a  timeless  land  that \\ndid  not  fade  or  change  or  fall  into  forgetfulness.  When  he \\nhad  gone  and  passed  again  into  the  outer  world,  still  Frodo \\nthe  wanderer  from  the  Shire  would  walk  there,  upon  the  grass \\namong  elanor  and  niphredil  in  fair  Lothlorien. \\n\\nThey  entered  the  circle  of  white  trees.  As  they  did  so  the \\nSouth  Wind  blew  upon  Cerin  Amroth  and  sighed  among  the \\nbranches.  Frodo  stood  still,  hearing  far  off  great  seas  upon \\nbeaches  that  had  long  ago  been  washed  away,  and  sea-birds \\ncrying  whose  race  had  perished  from  the  earth. \\n\\nHaldir  had  gone  on  and  was  now  climbing  to  the  high  flet. \\nAs  Frodo  prepared  to  follow  him,  he  laid  his  hand  upon  the \\ntree  beside  the  ladder:  never  before  had  he  been  so  suddenly \\nand  so  keenly  aware  of  the  feel  and  texture  of  a  tree’s  skin \\nand  of  the  life  within  it.  He  felt  a  delight  in  wood  and  the \\ntouch  of  it,  neither  as  forester  nor  as  carpenter;  it  was  the \\ndelight  of  the  living  tree  itself. \\n\\nAs  he  stepped  out  at  last  upon  the  lofty  platform,  Haldir \\ntook  his  hand  and  turned  him  towards  the  South.  ‘Look  this \\nway  first!’  he  said. \\n\\nFrodo  looked  and  saw,  still  at  some  distance,  a  hill  of  many \\nmighty  trees,  or  a  city  of  green  towers:  which  it  was  he  could \\nnot  tell.  Out  of  it,  it  seemed  to  him  that  the  power  and  light \\n\\n\\n458 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\ncame  that  held  all  the  land  in  sway.  He  longed  suddenly  to \\nfly  like  a  bird  to  rest  in  the  green  city.  Then  he  looked  east¬ \\nward  and  saw  all  the  land  of  Lorien  running  down  to  the  pale \\ngleam  of  Anduin,  the  Great  River.  He  lifted  his  eyes  across \\nthe  river  and  all  the  light  went  out,  and  he  was  back  again  in \\nthe  world  he  knew.  Beyond  the  river  the  land  appeared  flat \\nand  empty,  formless  and  vague,  until  far  away  it  rose  again \\nlike  a  wall,  dark  and  drear.  The  sun  that  lay  on  Lothlorien \\nhad  no  power  to  enlighten  the  shadow  of  that  distant  height. \\n\\n‘There  lies  the  fastness  of  Southern  Mirkwood,’  said \\nHaldir.  ‘It  is  clad  in  a  forest  of  dark  fir,  where  the  trees  strive \\none  against  another  and  their  branches  rot  and  wither.  In  the \\nmidst  upon  a  stony  height  stands  Dol  Guldur,  where  long \\nthe  hidden  Enemy  had  his  dwelling.  We  fear  that  now  it  is \\ninhabited  again,  and  with  power  sevenfold.  A  black  cloud  lies \\noften  over  it  of  late.  In  this  high  place  you  may  see  the  two \\npowers  that  are  opposed  one  to  another;  and  ever  they  strive \\nnow  in  thought,  but  whereas  the  light  perceives  the  very  heart \\nof  the  darkness,  its  own  secret  has  not  been  discovered.  Not \\nyet.’  He  turned  and  climbed  swiftly  down,  and  they  followed \\nhim. \\n\\nAt  the  hill’s  foot  Frodo  found  Aragorn,  standing  still  and \\nsilent  as  a  tree;  but  in  his  hand  was  a  small  golden  bloom  of \\nelanor,  and  a  light  was  in  his  eyes.  He  was  wrapped  in  some \\nfair  memory:  and  as  Frodo  looked  at  him  he  knew  that  he \\nbeheld  things  as  they  once  had  been  in  this  same  place.  For \\nthe  grim  years  were  removed  from  the  face  of  Aragorn,  and \\nhe  seemed  clothed  in  white,  a  young  lord  tall  and  fair;  and \\nhe  spoke  words  in  the  Elvish  tongue  to  one  whom  Frodo \\ncould  not  see.  Arwen  vanimelda,  namarie!  he  said,  and  then \\nhe  drew  a  breath,  and  returning  out  of  his  thought  he  looked \\nat  Frodo  and  smiled. \\n\\n‘Here  is  the  heart  of  Elvendom  on  earth,’  he  said,  ‘and  here \\nmy  heart  dwells  ever,  unless  there  be  a  light  beyond  the  dark \\nroads  that  we  still  must  tread,  you  and  I.  Come  with  me!’ \\nAnd  taking  Frodo’s  hand  in  his,  he  left  the  hill  of  Cerin \\nAmroth  and  came  there  never  again  as  living  man. \\n\\n\\nChapter  7 \\n\\n\\nTHE  MIRROR  OF  GALADRIEL \\n\\n\\nThe  sun  was  sinking  behind  the  mountains,  and  the  shadows \\nwere  deepening  in  the  woods,  when  they  went  on  again. \\nTheir  paths  now  went  into  thickets  where  the  dusk  had \\nalready  gathered.  Night  came  beneath  the  trees  as  they \\nwalked,  and  the  Elves  uncovered  their  silver  lamps. \\n\\nSuddenly  they  came  out  into  the  open  again  and  found \\nthemselves  under  a  pale  evening  sky  pricked  by  a  few  early \\nstars.  There  was  a  wide  treeless  space  before  them,  running \\nin  a  great  circle  and  bending  away  on  either  hand.  Beyond  it \\nwas  a  deep  fosse  lost  in  soft  shadow,  but  the  grass  upon  its \\nbrink  was  green,  as  if  it  glowed  still  in  memory  of  the  sun \\nthat  had  gone.  Upon  the  further  side  there  rose  to  a  great \\nheight  a  green  wall  encircling  a  green  hill  thronged  with \\nmallorn-trees  taller  than  any  they  had  yet  seen  in  all  the \\nland.  Their  height  could  not  be  guessed,  but  they  stood \\nup  in  the  twilight  like  living  towers.  In  their  many-tiered \\nbranches  and  amid  their  ever-moving  leaves  countless  lights \\nwere  gleaming,  green  and  gold  and  silver.  Haldir  turned \\ntowards  the  Company. \\n\\n‘Welcome  to  Caras  Galadhon!’  he  said.  ‘Here  is  the  city  of \\nthe  Galadhrim  where  dwell  the  Lord  Celeborn  and  Galadriel \\nthe  Lady  of  Lorien.  But  we  cannot  enter  here,  for  the  gates \\ndo  not  look  northward.  We  must  go  round  to  the  southern \\nside,  and  the  way  is  not  short,  for  the  city  is  great.’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  road  paved  with  white  stone  running  on  the \\nouter  brink  of  the  fosse.  Along  this  they  went  westward,  with \\nthe  city  ever  climbing  up  like  a  green  cloud  upon  their  left; \\nand  as  the  night  deepened  more  lights  sprang  forth,  until  all \\nthe  hill  seemed  afire  with  stars.  They  came  at  last  to  a  white \\n\\n\\n460  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nbridge,  and  crossing  found  the  great  gates  of  the  city:  they \\nfaced  south-west,  set  between  the  ends  of  the  encircling  wall \\nthat  here  overlapped,  and  they  were  tall  and  strong,  and  hung \\nwith  many  lamps. \\n\\nHaldir  knocked  and  spoke,  and  the  gates  opened  sound¬ \\nlessly;  but  of  guards  Frodo  could  see  no  sign.  The  travellers \\npassed  within,  and  the  gates  shut  behind  them.  They  were  in \\na  deep  lane  between  the  ends  of  the  wall,  and  passing  quickly \\nthrough  it  they  entered  the  City  of  the  Trees.  No  folk  could \\nthey  see,  nor  hear  any  feet  upon  the  paths;  but  there  were \\nmany  voices,  about  them,  and  in  the  air  above.  Far  away  up \\non  the  hill  they  could  hear  the  sound  of  singing  falling  from \\non  high  like  soft  rain  upon  leaves. \\n\\nThey  went  along  many  paths  and  climbed  many  stairs, \\nuntil  they  came  to  the  high  places  and  saw  before  them  amid \\na  wide  lawn  a  fountain  shimmering.  It  was  lit  by  silver  lamps \\nthat  swung  from  the  boughs  of  trees,  and  it  fell  into  a  basin \\nof  silver,  from  which  a  white  stream  spilled.  Upon  the  south \\nside  of  the  lawn  there  stood  the  mightiest  of  all  the  trees;  its \\ngreat  smooth  bole  gleamed  like  grey  silk,  and  up  it  towered, \\nuntil  its  first  branches,  far  above,  opened  their  huge  limbs \\nunder  shadowy  clouds  of  leaves.  Beside  it  a  broad  white \\nladder  stood,  and  at  its  foot  three  Elves  were  seated.  They \\nsprang  up  as  the  travellers  approached,  and  Frodo  saw  that \\nthey  were  tall  and  clad  in  grey  mail,  and  from  their  shoulders \\nhung  long  white  cloaks. \\n\\n‘Flere  dwell  Celeborn  and  Galadriel,’  said  Flaldir.  ‘It  is  their \\nwish  that  you  should  ascend  and  speak  with  them.’ \\n\\nOne  of  the  Elf-wardens  then  blew  a  clear  note  on  a  small \\nhorn,  and  it  was  answered  three  times  from  far  above.  ‘I  will \\ngo  first,’  said  Haldir.  ‘Let  Frodo  come  next  and  with  him \\nLegolas.  The  others  may  follow  as  they  wish.  It  is  a  long \\nclimb  for  those  that  are  not  accustomed  to  such  stairs,  but \\nyou  may  rest  upon  the  way.’ \\n\\nAs  he  climbed  slowly  up  Frodo  passed  many  flets:  some \\non  one  side,  some  on  another,  and  some  set  about  the  bole \\n\\n\\nTHE  MIRROR  OF  GALADRIEL  461 \\n\\nof  the  tree,  so  that  the  ladder  passed  through  them.  At  a  great \\nheight  above  the  ground  he  came  to  a  wide  talan,  like  the \\ndeck  of  a  great  ship.  On  it  was  built  a  house,  so  large  that \\nalmost  it  would  have  served  for  a  hall  of  Men  upon  the \\nearth.  He  entered  behind  Haldir,  and  found  that  he  was  in  a \\nchamber  of  oval  shape,  in  the  midst  of  which  grew  the  trunk \\nof  the  great  mallorn,  now  tapering  towards  its  crown,  and  yet \\nmaking  still  a  pillar  of  wide  girth. \\n\\nThe  chamber  was  filled  with  a  soft  light;  its  walls  were \\ngreen  and  silver  and  its  roof  of  gold.  Many  Elves  were  seated \\nthere.  On  two  chairs  beneath  the  bole  of  the  tree  and  canopied \\nby  a  living  bough  there  sat,  side  by  side,  Celeborn  and \\nGaladriel.  They  stood  up  to  greet  their  guests,  after  the \\nmanner  of  Elves,  even  those  who  were  accounted  mighty \\nkings.  Very  tall  they  were,  and  the  Lady  no  less  tall  than  the \\nLord;  and  they  were  grave  and  beautiful.  They  were  clad \\nwholly  in  white;  and  the  hair  of  the  Lady  was  of  deep  gold, \\nand  the  hair  of  the  Lord  Celeborn  was  of  silver  long  and \\nbright;  but  no  sign  of  age  was  upon  them,  unless  it  were  in \\nthe  depths  of  their  eyes;  for  these  were  keen  as  lances  in  the \\nstarlight,  and  yet  profound,  the  wells  of  deep  memory. \\n\\nHaldir  led  Frodo  before  them,  and  the  Lord  welcomed  him \\nin  his  own  tongue.  The  Lady  Galadriel  said  no  word  but \\nlooked  long  upon  his  face. \\n\\n‘Sit  now  beside  my  chair,  Frodo  of  the  Shire!’  said  Cele¬ \\nborn.  ‘When  all  have  come  we  will  speak  together.’ \\n\\nEach  of  the  companions  he  greeted  courteously  by  name \\nas  they  entered.  ‘Welcome  Aragorn  son  of  Arathorn!’  he  said. \\n‘It  is  eight  and  thirty  years  of  the  world  outside  since  you \\ncame  to  this  land;  and  those  years  lie  heavy  on  you.  But  the \\nend  is  near,  for  good  or  ill.  Here  lay  aside  your  burden  for  a \\nwhile!’ \\n\\nWelcome  son  of  Thranduil!  Too  seldom  do  my  kindred \\njourney  hither  from  the  North.’ \\n\\n‘Welcome  Gimli  son  of  Gloin!  It  is  long  indeed  since  we \\nsaw  one  of  Durin’s  folk  in  Caras  Galadhon.  But  today  we \\nhave  broken  our  long  law.  May  it  be  a  sign  that  though  the \\n\\n\\n462  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nworld  is  now  dark  better  days  are  at  hand,  and  that  friendship \\nshall  be  renewed  between  our  peoples.’  Gimli  bowed  low. \\n\\nWhen  all  the  guests  were  seated  before  his  chair  the  Lord \\nlooked  at  them  again.  ‘Here  there  are  eight,’  he  said.  ‘Nine \\nwere  to  set  out:  so  said  the  messages.  But  maybe  there  has \\nbeen  some  change  of  counsel  that  we  have  not  heard.  Elrond \\nis  far  away,  and  darkness  gathers  between  us,  and  all  this  year \\nthe  shadows  have  grown  longer.’ \\n\\n‘Nay,  there  was  no  change  of  counsel,’  said  the  Lady \\nGaladriel,  speaking  for  the  first  time.  Her  voice  was  clear  and \\nmusical,  but  deeper  than  woman’s  wont.  ‘Gandalf  the  Grey \\nset  out  with  the  Company,  but  he  did  not  pass  the  borders \\nof  this  land.  Now  tell  us  where  he  is;  for  I  much  desired  to \\nspeak  with  him  again.  But  I  cannot  see  him  from  afar,  unless \\nhe  comes  within  the  fences  of  Lothlorien:  a  grey  mist  is  about \\nhim,  and  the  ways  of  his  feet  and  of  his  mind  are  hidden \\nfrom  me.’ \\n\\n‘Alas!’  said  Aragorn.  ‘Gandalf  the  Grey  fell  into  shadow. \\nHe  remained  in  Moria  and  did  not  escape.’ \\n\\nAt  these  words  all  the  Elves  in  the  hall  cried  aloud  in  grief \\nand  amazement.  ‘These  are  evil  tidings,’  said  Celeborn,  ‘the \\nmost  evil  that  have  been  spoken  here  in  long  years  full  of \\ngrievous  deeds.’  He  turned  to  Haldir.  ‘Why  has  nothing  of \\nthis  been  told  to  me  before?’  he  asked  in  the  elven-tongue. \\n\\n‘We  have  not  spoken  to  Haldir  of  our  deeds  or  our  pur¬ \\npose,’  said  Legolas.  ‘At  first  we  were  weary  and  danger  was \\ntoo  close  behind;  and  afterwards  we  almost  forgot  our  grief \\nfor  a  time,  as  we  walked  in  gladness  on  the  fair  paths  of \\nLorien.’ \\n\\n‘Yet  our  grief  is  great  and  our  loss  cannot  be  mended,’  said \\nFrodo.  ‘Gandalf  was  our  guide,  and  he  led  us  through  Moria; \\nand  when  our  escape  seemed  beyond  hope  he  saved  us,  and \\nhe  fell.’ \\n\\n‘Tell  us  now  the  full  tale!’  said  Celeborn. \\n\\nThen  Aragorn  recounted  all  that  had  happened  upon  the \\npass  of  Caradhras,  and  in  the  days  that  followed;  and  he \\n\\n\\nTHE  MIRROR  OF  GALADRIEL  463 \\n\\nspoke  of  Balin  and  his  book,  and  the  fight  in  the  Chamber \\nof  Mazarbul,  and  the  fire,  and  the  narrow  bridge,  and  the \\ncoming  of  the  Terror.  ‘An  evil  of  the  Ancient  World  it \\nseemed,  such  as  I  have  never  seen  before,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘It \\nwas  both  a  shadow  and  a  flame,  strong  and  terrible.’ \\n\\n‘It  was  a  Balrog  of  Morgoth,’  said  Legolas;  ‘of  all  elf-banes \\nthe  most  deadly,  save  the  One  who  sits  in  the  Dark  Tower.’ \\n\\n‘Indeed  I  saw  upon  the  bridge  that  which  haunts  our  dark¬ \\nest  dreams,  I  saw  Durin’s  Bane,’  said  Gimli  in  a  low  voice, \\nand  dread  was  in  his  eyes. \\n\\n‘Alas!’  said  Celeborn.  ‘We  long  have  feared  that  under \\nCaradhras  a  terror  slept.  But  had  I  known  that  the  Dwarves \\nhad  stirred  up  this  evil  in  Moria  again,  I  would  have  forbidden \\nyou  to  pass  the  northern  borders,  you  and  all  that  went  with \\nyou.  And  if  it  were  possible,  one  would  say  that  at  the  last \\nGandalf  fell  from  wisdom  into  folly,  going  needlessly  into  the \\nnet  of  Moria.’ \\n\\n‘He  would  be  rash  indeed  that  said  that  thing,’  said \\nGaladriel  gravely.  ‘Needless  were  none  of  the  deeds  of \\nGandalf  in  life.  Those  that  followed  him  knew  not  his  mind \\nand  cannot  report  his  full  purpose.  But  however  it  may  be \\nwith  the  guide,  the  followers  are  blameless.  Do  not  repent \\nof  your  welcome  to  the  Dwarf.  If  our  folk  had  been  exiled \\nlong  and  far  from  Lothlorien,  who  of  the  Galadhrim,  even \\nCeleborn  the  Wise,  would  pass  nigh  and  would  not  wish  to \\nlook  upon  their  ancient  home,  though  it  had  become  an  abode \\nof  dragons? \\n\\n‘Dark  is  the  water  of  Kheled-zaram,  and  cold  are  the \\nsprings  of  Kibil-nala,  and  fair  were  the  many-pillared  halls  of \\nKhazad-dum  in  Elder  Days  before  the  fall  of  mighty  lungs \\nbeneath  the  stone.’  She  looked  upon  Gimli,  who  sat  glowering \\nand  sad,  and  she  smiled.  And  the  Dwarf,  hearing  the  names \\ngiven  in  his  own  ancient  tongue,  looked  up  and  met  her  eyes; \\nand  it  seemed  to  him  that  he  looked  suddenly  into  the  heart \\nof  an  enemy  and  saw  there  love  and  understanding.  Wonder \\ncame  into  his  face,  and  then  he  smiled  in  answer. \\n\\nHe  rose  clumsily  and  bowed  in  dwarf-fashion,  saying:  ‘Y et \\n\\n\\n464  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nmore  fair  is  the  living  land  of  Lorien,  and  the  Lady  Galadriel \\nis  above  all  the  jewels  that  lie  beneath  the  earth!’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  silence.  At  length  Celeborn  spoke  again.  ‘I  did \\nnot  know  that  your  plight  was  so  evil,’  he  said.  ‘Let  Gimli \\nforget  my  harsh  words:  I  spoke  in  the  trouble  of  my  heart.  I \\nwill  do  what  I  can  to  aid  you,  each  according  to  his  wish  and \\nneed,  but  especially  that  one  of  the  little  folk  who  bears  the \\nburden.’ \\n\\n‘Your  quest  is  known  to  us,’  said  Galadriel,  looking  at \\nFrodo.  ‘But  we  will  not  here  speak  of  it  more  openly.  Yet  not \\nin  vain  will  it  prove,  maybe,  that  you  came  to  this  land  seeking \\naid,  as  Gandalf  himself  plainly  purposed.  For  the  Lord  of  the \\nGaladhrim  is  accounted  the  wisest  of  the  Elves  of  Middle- \\nearth,  and  a  giver  of  gifts  beyond  the  power  of  kings.  He  has \\ndwelt  in  the  West  since  the  days  of  dawn,  and  I  have  dwelt \\nwith  him  years  uncounted;  for  ere  the  fall  of  Nargothrond  or \\nGondolin  I  passed  over  the  mountains,  and  together  through \\nages  of  the  world  we  have  fought  the  long  defeat. \\n\\n‘I  it  was  who  first  summoned  the  White  Council.  And  if \\nmy  designs  had  not  gone  amiss,  it  would  have  been  governed \\nby  Gandalf  the  Grey,  and  then  mayhap  things  would  have \\ngone  otherwise.  But  even  now  there  is  hope  left.  I  will  not \\ngive  you  counsel,  saying  do  this,  or  do  that.  For  not  in  doing \\nor  contriving,  nor  in  choosing  between  this  course  and \\nanother,  can  I  avail;  but  only  in  knowing  what  was  and  is, \\nand  in  part  also  what  shall  be.  But  this  I  will  say  to  you:  your \\nQuest  stands  upon  the  edge  of  a  knife.  Stray  but  a  little  and \\nit  will  fail,  to  the  ruin  of  all.  Yet  hope  remains  while  all  the \\nCompany  is  true.’ \\n\\nAnd  with  that  word  she  held  them  with  her  eyes,  and  in \\nsilence  looked  searchingly  at  each  of  them  in  turn.  None  save \\nLegolas  and  Aragorn  could  long  endure  her  glance.  Sam \\nquickly  blushed  and  hung  his  head. \\n\\nAt  length  the  Lady  Galadriel  released  them  from  her  eyes, \\nand  she  smiled.  ‘Do  not  let  your  hearts  be  troubled,’  she  said. \\n‘Tonight  you  shall  sleep  in  peace.’  Then  they  sighed  and  felt \\n\\n\\nTHE  MIRROR  OF  GALADRIEL  465 \\n\\nsuddenly  weary,  as  those  who  have  been  questioned  long  and \\ndeeply,  though  no  words  had  been  spoken  openly. \\n\\n‘Go  now!’  said  Celeborn.  ‘You  are  worn  with  sorrow  and \\nmuch  toil.  Even  if  your  Quest  did  not  concern  us  closely,  you \\nshould  have  refuge  in  this  City,  until  you  were  healed  and \\nrefreshed.  Now  you  shall  rest,  and  we  will  not  speak  of  your \\nfurther  road  for  a  while.’ \\n\\nThat  night  the  Company  slept  upon  the  ground,  much  to \\nthe  satisfaction  of  the  hobbits.  The  Elves  spread  for  them  a \\npavilion  among  the  trees  near  the  fountain,  and  in  it  they  laid \\nsoft  couches;  then  speaking  words  of  peace  with  fair  Elvish \\nvoices  they  left  them.  For  a  little  while  the  travellers  talked  of \\ntheir  night  before  in  the  tree-tops,  and  of  their  day’s  journey, \\nand  of  the  Lord  and  Lady;  for  they  had  not  yet  the  heart  to \\nlook  further  back. \\n\\n‘What  did  you  blush  for,  Sam?’  said  Pippin.  ‘You  soon \\nbroke  down.  Anyone  would  have  thought  you  had  a  guilty \\nconscience.  I  hope  it  was  nothing  worse  than  a  wicked  plot \\nto  steal  one  of  my  blankets.’ \\n\\n‘I  never  thought  no  such  thing,’  answered  Sam,  in  no  mood \\nfor  jest.  ‘If  you  want  to  know,  I  felt  as  if  I  hadn’t  got  nothing \\non,  and  I  didn’t  like  it.  She  seemed  to  be  looking  inside  me \\nand  asking  me  what  I  would  do  if  she  gave  me  the  chance  of \\nflying  back  home  to  the  Shire  to  a  nice  little  hole  with  -  with \\na  bit  of  garden  of  my  own.’ \\n\\n‘That’s  funny,’  said  Merry.  ‘Almost  exactly  what  I  felt \\nmyself;  only,  only  well,  I  don’t  think  I’ll  say  any  more,’  he \\nended  lamely. \\n\\nAll  of  them,  it  seemed,  had  fared  alike:  each  had  felt  that \\nhe  was  offered  a  choice  between  a  shadow  full  of  fear  that \\nlay  ahead,  and  something  that  he  greatly  desired:  clear  before \\nhis  mind  it  lay,  and  to  get  it  he  had  only  to  turn  aside  from \\nthe  road  and  leave  the  Quest  and  the  war  against  Sauron  to \\nothers. \\n\\n‘And  it  seemed  to  me,  too,’  said  Gimli,  ‘that  my  choice \\nwould  remain  secret  and  known  only  to  myself.’ \\n\\n\\n466 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘To  me  it  seemed  exceedingly  strange,’  said  Boromir. \\n‘Maybe  it  was  only  a  test,  and  she  thought  to  read  our \\nthoughts  for  her  own  good  purpose;  but  almost  I  should \\nhave  said  that  she  was  tempting  us,  and  offering  what  she \\npretended  to  have  the  power  to  give.  It  need  not  be  said  that \\nI  refused  to  listen.  The  Men  of  Minas  Tirith  are  true  to  their \\nword.’  But  what  he  thought  that  the  Lady  had  offered  him \\nBoromir  did  not  tell. \\n\\nAnd  as  for  Frodo,  he  would  not  speak,  though  Boromir \\npressed  him  with  questions.  ‘She  held  you  long  in  her  gaze, \\nRing-bearer,’  he  said. \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  Frodo;  ‘but  whatever  came  into  my  mind  then \\nI  will  keep  there.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  have  a  care!’  said  Boromir.  ‘I  do  not  feel  too  sure  of \\nthis  Elvish  Lady  and  her  purposes.’ \\n\\n‘Speak  no  evil  of  the  Lady  Galadriel!’  said  Aragorn  sternly. \\n‘Y ou  know  not  what  you  say.  There  is  in  her  and  in  this  land \\nno  evil,  unless  a  man  bring  it  hither  himself.  Then  let  him \\nbeware!  But  tonight  I  shall  sleep  without  fear  for  the  first  time \\nsince  I  left  Rivendell.  And  may  I  sleep  deep,  and  forget  for  a \\nwhile  my  grief!  I  am  weary  in  body  and  in  heart.’  He  cast \\nhimself  down  upon  his  couch  and  fell  at  once  into  a  long \\nsleep. \\n\\nThe  others  soon  did  the  same,  and  no  sound  or  dream \\ndisturbed  their  slumber.  When  they  woke  they  found  that  the \\nlight  of  day  was  broad  upon  the  lawn  before  the  pavilion,  and \\nthe  fountain  rose  and  fell  glittering  in  the  sun. \\n\\nThey  remained  some  days  in  Lothlorien,  so  far  as  they \\ncould  tell  or  remember.  All  the  while  that  they  dwelt  there \\nthe  sun  shone  clear,  save  for  a  gentle  rain  that  fell  at  times, \\nand  passed  away  leaving  all  things  fresh  and  clean.  The  air \\nwas  cool  and  soft,  as  if  it  were  early  spring,  yet  they  felt  about \\nthem  the  deep  and  thoughtful  quiet  of  winter.  It  seemed  to \\nthem  that  they  did  little  but  eat  and  drink  and  rest,  and  walk \\namong  the  trees;  and  it  was  enough. \\n\\nThey  had  not  seen  the  Lord  and  Lady  again,  and  they  had \\n\\n\\nTHE  MIRROR  OF  GALADRIEL \\n\\n\\n467 \\n\\n\\nlittle  speech  with  the  Elven-folk;  for  few  of  these  knew  or \\nwould  use  the  Westron  tongue.  Haldir  had  bidden  them  fare¬ \\nwell  and  gone  back  again  to  the  fences  of  the  North,  where \\ngreat  watch  was  now  kept  since  the  tidings  of  Moria  that  the \\nCompany  had  brought.  Legolas  was  away  much  among  the \\nGaladhrim,  and  after  the  first  night  he  did  not  sleep  with \\nthe  other  companions,  though  he  returned  to  eat  and  talk \\nwith  them.  Often  he  took  Gimli  with  him  when  he  went \\nabroad  in  the  land,  and  the  others  wondered  at  this  change. \\n\\nNow  as  the  companions  sat  or  walked  together  they  spoke \\nof  Gandalf,  and  all  that  each  had  known  and  seen  of  him \\ncame  clear  before  their  minds.  As  they  were  healed  of  hurt \\nand  weariness  of  body  the  grief  of  their  loss  grew  more  keen. \\nOften  they  heard  nearby  Elvish  voices  singing,  and  knew  that \\nthey  were  making  songs  of  lamentation  for  his  fall,  for  they \\ncaught  his  name  among  the  sweet  sad  words  that  they  could \\nnot  understand. \\n\\nMithrandir ,  Mithrandir  sang  the  Elves,  O  Pilgrim  Grey!  For \\nso  they  loved  to  call  him.  But  if  Legolas  was  with  the  Com¬ \\npany,  he  would  not  interpret  the  songs  for  them,  saying  that \\nhe  had  not  the  skill,  and  that  for  him  the  grief  was  still  too \\nnear,  a  matter  for  tears  and  not  yet  for  song. \\n\\nIt  was  Frodo  who  first  put  something  of  his  sorrow  into \\nhalting  words.  He  was  seldom  moved  to  make  song  or  rhyme; \\neven  in  Rivendell  he  had  listened  and  had  not  sung  himself, \\nthough  his  memory  was  stored  with  many  things  that  others \\nhad  made  before  him.  But  now  as  he  sat  beside  the  fountain \\nin  Lorien  and  heard  about  him  the  voices  of  the  Elves,  his \\nthought  took  shape  in  a  song  that  seemed  fair  to  him;  yet \\nwhen  he  tried  to  repeat  it  to  Sam  only  snatches  remained, \\nfaded  as  a  handful  of  withered  leaves. \\n\\nWhen  evening  in  the  Shire  was  grey \\nhis  footsteps  on  the  Hill  were  heard; \\nbefore  the  dawn  he  went  away \\non  journey  long  without  a  word. \\n\\n\\n468 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nFrom  Wilderland  to  Western  shore, \\nfrom  northern  waste  to  southern  hill, \\nthrough  dragon-lair  and  hidden  door \\nand  darkling  woods  he  walked  at  will. \\n\\nWith  Dwarf  and  Hobbit,  Elves  and  Men, \\nwith  mortal  and  immortal  folk, \\nwith  bird  on  bough  and  beast  in  den, \\nin  their  own  secret  tongues  he  spoke. \\n\\nA  deadly  sword,  a  healing  hand, \\na  back  that  bent  beneath  its  load; \\na  trumpet-voice,  a  burning  brand, \\na  weary  pilgrim  on  the  road. \\n\\nA  lord  of  wisdom  throned  he  sat, \\nswift  in  anger,  quick  to  laugh; \\nan  old  man  in  a  battered  hat \\nwho  leaned  upon  a  thorny  staff. \\n\\nHe  stood  upon  the  bridge  alone \\nand  Fire  and  Shadow  both  defied; \\nhis  staff  was  broken  on  the  stone, \\nin  Khazad-dum  his  wisdom  died. \\n\\n‘Why,  you’ll  be  beating  Mr.  Bilbo  next!’  said  Sam. \\n\\n‘No,  I  am  afraid  not,’  said  Frodo.  ‘But  that  is  the  best  I \\ncan  do  yet.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  Mr.  Frodo,  if  you  do  have  another  go,  I  hope  you’ll \\nsay  a  word  about  his  fireworks,’  said  Sam.  ‘Something  like \\nthis: \\n\\n\\nThe  finest  rockets  ever  seen: \\nthey  burst  in  stars  of  blue  and  green, \\nor  after  thunder  golden  showers \\ncame  falling  like  a  rain  of  flowers. \\n\\n\\nTHE  MIRROR  OF  GALADRIEL  469 \\n\\nThough  that  doesn’t  do  them  justice  by  a  long  road.’ \\n\\n‘No,  I’ll  leave  that  to  you,  Sam.  Or  perhaps  to  Bilbo. \\nBut  -  well,  I  can’t  talk  of  it  any  more.  I  can’t  bear  to  think \\nof  bringing  the  news  to  him.’ \\n\\nOne  evening  Frodo  and  Sam  were  walking  together  in \\nthe  cool  twilight.  Both  of  them  felt  restless  again.  On  Frodo \\nsuddenly  the  shadow  of  parting  had  fallen:  he  knew  somehow \\nthat  the  time  was  very  near  when  he  must  leave  Lothlorien. \\n\\n‘What  do  you  think  of  Elves  now,  Sam?’  he  said.  ‘I  asked \\nyou  the  same  question  once  before  -  it  seems  a  very  long \\nwhile  ago;  but  you  have  seen  more  of  them  since  then.’ \\n\\n‘I  have  indeed!’  said  Sam.  ‘And  I  reckon  there’s  Elves  and \\nElves.  They’re  all  Elvish  enough,  but  they’re  not  all  the  same. \\nNow  these  folk  aren’t  wanderers  or  homeless,  and  seem  a  bit \\nnearer  to  the  likes  of  us:  they  seem  to  belong  here,  more  even \\nthan  Etobbits  do  in  the  Shire.  Whether  they’ve  made  the  land, \\nor  the  land’s  made  them,  it’s  hard  to  say,  if  you  take  my \\nmeaning.  It’s  wonderfully  quiet  here.  Nothing  seems  to  be \\ngoing  on,  and  nobody  seems  to  want  it  to.  If  there’s  any \\nmagic  about,  it’s  right  down  deep,  where  I  can’t  lay  my  hands \\non  it,  in  a  manner  of  speaking.’ \\n\\n‘You  can  see  and  feel  it  everywhere,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Well,’  said  Sam,  ‘you  can’t  see  nobody  working  it.  No \\nfireworks  like  poor  old  Gandalf  used  to  show.  I  wonder  we \\ndon’t  see  nothing  of  the  Lord  and  Lady  in  all  these  days. \\nI  fancy  now  that  she  could  do  some  wonderful  things,  if \\nshe  had  a  mind.  I’d  dearly  love  to  see  some  Elf-magic,  Mr. \\nFrodo!’ \\n\\n‘I  wouldn’t,’  said  Frodo.  ‘I  am  content.  And  I  don’t  miss \\nGandalf ’s  fireworks,  but  his  bushy  eyebrows,  and  his  quick \\ntemper,  and  his  voice.’ \\n\\n‘You’re  right,’  said  Sam.  ‘And  don’t  think  I’m  finding  fault. \\nI’ve  often  wanted  to  see  a  bit  of  magic  like  what  it  tells  of  in \\nold  tales,  but  I’ve  never  heard  of  a  better  land  than  this.  It’s \\nlike  being  at  home  and  on  a  holiday  at  the  same  time,  if  you \\nunderstand  me.  I  don’t  want  to  leave.  All  the  same,  I’m \\n\\n\\n470 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nbeginning  to  feel  that  if  we’ve  got  to  go  on,  then  we’d  best \\nget  it  over. \\n\\n‘ It’s  the  job  that’s  never  started  as  takes  longest  to  finish ,  as \\nmy  old  gaffer  used  to  say.  And  I  don’t  reckon  that  these  folk \\ncan  do  much  more  to  help  us,  magic  or  no.  It’s  when  we  leave \\nthis  land  that  we  shall  miss  Gandalf  worse,  I’m  thinking.’ \\n\\n‘I  am  afraid  that’s  only  too  true,  Sam,’  said  Frodo.  ‘Yet  I \\nhope  very  much  that  before  we  leave  we  shall  see  the  Lady \\nof  the  Elves  again.’ \\n\\nEven  as  he  spoke,  they  saw,  as  if  she  came  in  answer  to \\ntheir  words,  the  Lady  Galadriel  approaching.  Tall  and  white \\nand  fair  she  walked  beneath  the  trees.  She  spoke  no  word, \\nbut  beckoned  to  them. \\n\\nTurning  aside,  she  led  them  towards  the  southern  slopes \\nof  the  hill  of  Caras  Galadhon,  and  passing  through  a  high \\ngreen  hedge  they  came  into  an  enclosed  garden.  No  trees \\ngrew  there,  and  it  lay  open  to  the  sky.  The  evening  star  had \\nrisen  and  was  shining  with  white  fire  above  the  western \\nwoods.  Down  a  long  flight  of  steps  the  Lady  went  into  the \\ndeep  green  hollow,  through  which  ran  murmuring  the  silver \\nstream  that  issued  from  the  fountain  on  the  hill.  At  the \\nbottom,  upon  a  low  pedestal  carved  like  a  branching  tree, \\nstood  a  basin  of  silver,  wide  and  shallow,  and  beside  it  stood \\na  silver  ewer. \\n\\nWith  water  from  the  stream  Galadriel  filled  the  basin  to \\nthe  brim,  and  breathed  on  it,  and  when  the  water  was  still \\nagain  she  spoke.  ‘Here  is  the  Mirror  of  Galadriel,’  she  said. \\n‘I  have  brought  you  here  so  that  you  may  look  in  it,  if  you \\nwill.’ \\n\\nThe  air  was  very  still,  and  the  dell  was  dark,  and  the  Elf- \\nlady  beside  him  was  tall  and  pale.  ‘What  shall  we  look  for, \\nand  what  shall  we  see?’  asked  Frodo,  filled  with  awe. \\n\\n‘Many  things  I  can  command  the  Mirror  to  reveal,’  she \\nanswered,  ‘and  to  some  I  can  show  what  they  desire  to  see. \\nBut  the  Mirror  will  also  show  things  unbidden,  and  those  are \\noften  stranger  and  more  profitable  than  things  which  we  wish \\nto  behold.  What  you  will  see,  if  you  leave  the  Mirror  free  to \\n\\n\\nTHE  MIRROR  OF  GALADRIEL \\n\\n\\n471 \\n\\n\\nwork,  I  cannot  tell.  For  it  shows  things  that  were,  and  things \\nthat  are,  and  things  that  yet  may  be.  But  which  it  is  that  he \\nsees,  even  the  wisest  cannot  always  tell.  Do  you  wish  to  look?’ \\n\\nFrodo  did  not  answer. \\n\\n‘And  you?’  she  said,  turning  to  Sam.  ‘For  this  is  what  your \\nfolic  would  call  magic,  I  believe;  though  I  do  not  understand \\nclearly  what  they  mean;  and  they  seem  to  use  the  same  word \\nof  the  deceits  of  the  Enemy.  But  this,  if  you  will,  is  the \\nmagic  of  Galadriel.  Did  you  not  say  that  you  wished  to  see \\nElf-magic?’ \\n\\n‘I  did,’  said  Sam,  trembling  a  little  between  fear  and  curi¬ \\nosity.  ‘I’ll  have  a  peep,  Lady,  if  you’re  willing. \\n\\n‘And  Fd  not  mind  a  glimpse  of  what’s  going  on  at  home,’ \\nhe  said  in  an  aside  to  Frodo.  ‘It  seems  a  terrible  long  time \\nthat  I’ve  been  away.  But  there,  like  as  not  I’ll  only  see  the \\nstars,  or  something  that  I  won’t  understand.’ \\n\\n‘Like  as  not,’  said  the  Lady  with  a  gentle  laugh.  ‘But  come, \\nyou  shall  look  and  see  what  you  may.  Do  not  touch  the \\nwater!’ \\n\\nSam  climbed  up  on  the  foot  of  the  pedestal  and  leaned \\nover  the  basin.  The  water  looked  hard  and  dark.  Stars  were \\nreflected  in  it. \\n\\n‘There’s  only  stars,  as  I  thought,’  he  said.  Then  he  gave  a \\nlow  gasp,  for  the  stars  went  out.  As  if  a  dark  veil  had  been \\nwithdrawn,  the  Mirror  grew  grey,  and  then  clear.  There  was \\nsun  shining,  and  the  branches  of  trees  were  waving  and  toss¬ \\ning  in  the  wind.  But  before  Sam  could  make  up  his  mind \\nwhat  it  was  that  he  saw,  the  light  faded;  and  now  he  thought \\nhe  saw  Frodo  with  a  pale  face  lying  fast  asleep  under  a  great \\ndark  cliff.  Then  he  seemed  to  see  himself  going  along  a  dim \\npassage,  and  climbing  an  endless  winding  stair.  It  came  to \\nhim  suddenly  that  he  was  looking  urgently  for  something, \\nbut  what  it  was  he  did  not  know.  Like  a  dream  the  vision \\nshifted  and  went  back,  and  he  saw  the  trees  again.  But  this \\ntime  they  were  not  so  close,  and  he  could  see  what  was  going \\non:  they  were  not  waving  in  the  wind,  they  were  falling, \\ncrashing  to  the  ground. \\n\\n\\n472 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Hi!’  cried  Sam  in  an  outraged  voice.  ‘There’s  that  Ted \\nSandyman  a-cutting  down  trees  as  he  shouldn’t.  They  didn’t \\nought  to  be  felled:  it’s  that  avenue  beyond  the  Mill  that  shades \\nthe  road  to  Bywater.  I  wish  I  could  get  at  Ted,  and  I’d  fell \\nhimV \\n\\nBut  now  Sam  noticed  that  the  Old  Mill  had  vanished,  and \\na  large  red-brick  building  was  being  put  up  where  it  had \\nstood.  Lots  of  folk  were  busily  at  work.  There  was  a  tall  red \\nchimney  nearby.  Black  smoke  seemed  to  cloud  the  surface  of \\nthe  Mirror. \\n\\n‘There’s  some  devilry  at  work  in  the  Shire,’  he  said.  ‘Elrond \\nknew  what  he  was  about  when  he  wanted  to  send  Mr.  Merry \\nback.’  Then  suddenly  Sam  gave  a  cry  and  sprang  away.  ‘I \\ncan’t  stay  here,’  he  said  wildly.  ‘I  must  go  home.  They’ve \\ndug  up  Bagshot  Row,  and  there’s  the  poor  old  Gaffer  going \\ndown  the  Hill  with  his  bits  of  things  on  a  barrow.  I  must  go \\nhome!’ \\n\\n‘You  cannot  go  home  alone,’  said  the  Lady.  ‘You  did  not \\nwish  to  go  home  without  your  master  before  you  looked  in \\nthe  Mirror,  and  yet  you  knew  that  evil  things  might  well  be \\nhappening  in  the  Shire.  Remember  that  the  Mirror  shows \\nmany  things,  and  not  all  have  yet  come  to  pass.  Some  never \\ncome  to  be,  unless  those  that  behold  the  visions  turn  aside \\nfrom  their  path  to  prevent  them.  The  Mirror  is  dangerous  as \\na  guide  of  deeds.’ \\n\\nSam  sat  on  the  ground  and  put  his  head  in  his  hands.  ‘I \\nwish  I  had  never  come  here,  and  I  don’t  want  to  see  no  more \\nmagic,’  he  said  and  fell  silent.  After  a  moment  he  spoke  again \\nthickly,  as  if  struggling  with  tears.  ‘No,  I’ll  go  home  by  the \\nlong  road  with  Mr.  Frodo,  or  not  at  all,’  he  said.  ‘But  I  hope \\nI  do  get  back  some  day.  If  what  I’ve  seen  turns  out  true, \\nsomebody’s  going  to  catch  it  hot!’ \\n\\n‘Do  you  now  wish  to  look,  Frodo?’  said  the  Lady  Galadriel. \\n‘You  did  not  wish  to  see  Elf-magic  and  were  content.’ \\n\\n‘Do  you  advise  me  to  look?’  asked  Frodo. \\n\\n‘No,’  she  said.  ‘I  do  not  counsel  you  one  way  or  the  other. \\n\\n\\nTHE  MIRROR  OF  GALADRIEL \\n\\n\\n473 \\n\\n\\nI  am  not  a  counsellor.  You  may  learn  something,  and  whether \\nwhat  you  see  be  fair  or  evil,  that  may  be  profitable,  and  yet \\nit  may  not.  Seeing  is  both  good  and  perilous.  Yet  I  think, \\nFrodo,  that  you  have  courage  and  wisdom  enough  for  the \\nventure,  or  I  would  not  have  brought  you  here.  Do  as  you \\nwill!’ \\n\\n‘I  will  look,’  said  Frodo,  and  he  climbed  on  the  pedestal \\nand  bent  over  the  dark  water.  At  once  the  Mirror  cleared  and \\nhe  saw  a  twilit  land.  Mountains  loomed  dark  in  the  distance \\nagainst  a  pale  sky.  A  long  grey  road  wound  back  out  of  sight. \\nFar  away  a  figure  came  slowly  down  the  road,  faint  and \\nsmall  at  first,  but  growing  larger  and  clearer  as  it  approached. \\nSuddenly  Frodo  realized  that  it  reminded  him  of  Gandalf. \\nHe  almost  called  aloud  the  wizard’s  name,  and  then  he  saw \\nthat  the  figure  was  clothed  not  in  grey  but  in  white,  in  a  white \\nthat  shone  faintly  in  the  dusk;  and  in  its  hand  there  was  a \\nwhite  staff.  The  head  was  so  bowed  that  he  could  see  no  face, \\nand  presently  the  figure  turned  aside  round  a  bend  in  the \\nroad  and  went  out  of  the  Mirror’s  view.  Doubt  came  into \\nFrodo’s  mind:  was  this  a  vision  of  Gandalf  on  one  of  his \\nmany  lonely  journeys  long  ago,  or  was  it  Saruman? \\n\\nThe  vision  now  changed.  Brief  and  small  but  very  vivid  he \\ncaught  a  glimpse  of  Bilbo  walking  restlessly  about  his  room. \\nThe  table  was  littered  with  disordered  papers;  rain  was  beat¬ \\ning  on  the  windows. \\n\\nThen  there  was  a  pause,  and  after  it  many  swift  scenes \\nfollowed  that  Frodo  in  some  way  knew  to  be  parts  of  a  great \\nhistory  in  which  he  had  become  involved.  The  mist  cleared \\nand  he  saw  a  sight  which  he  had  never  seen  before  but  knew \\nat  once:  the  Sea.  Darkness  fell.  The  sea  rose  and  raged  in  a \\ngreat  storm.  Then  he  saw  against  the  Sun,  sinking  blood-red \\ninto  a  wrack  of  clouds,  the  black  outline  of  a  tall  ship  with \\ntorn  sails  riding  up  out  of  the  West.  Then  a  wide  river  flowing \\nthrough  a  populous  city.  Then  a  white  fortress  with  seven \\ntowers.  And  then  again  a  ship  with  black  sails,  but  now  it  was \\nmorning  again,  and  the  water  rippled  with  light,  and  a  banner \\nbearing  the  emblem  of  a  white  tree  shone  in  the  sun.  A  smoke \\n\\n\\n474 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nas  of  fire  and  battle  arose,  and  again  the  sun  went  down  in  a \\nburning  red  that  faded  into  a  grey  mist;  and  into  the  mist  a \\nsmall  ship  passed  away,  twinkling  with  lights.  It  vanished, \\nand  Frodo  sighed  and  prepared  to  draw  away. \\n\\nBut  suddenly  the  Mirror  went  altogether  dark,  as  dark  as \\nif  a  hole  had  opened  in  the  world  of  sight,  and  Frodo  looked \\ninto  emptiness.  In  the  black  abyss  there  appeared  a  single \\nEye  that  slowly  grew,  until  it  filled  nearly  all  the  Mirror.  So \\nterrible  was  it  that  Frodo  stood  rooted,  unable  to  cry  out  or \\nto  withdraw  his  gaze.  The  Eye  was  rimmed  with  fire,  but  was \\nitself  glazed,  yellow  as  a  cat’s,  watchful  and  intent,  and  the \\nblack  slit  of  its  pupil  opened  on  a  pit,  a  window  into  nothing. \\n\\nThen  the  Eye  began  to  rove,  searching  this  way  and  that; \\nand  Frodo  knew  with  certainty  and  horror  that  among  the \\nmany  things  that  it  sought  he  himself  was  one.  But  he  also \\nknew  that  it  could  not  see  him  -  not  yet,  not  unless  he  willed \\nit.  The  Ring  that  hung  upon  its  chain  about  his  neck  grew \\nheavy,  heavier  than  a  great  stone,  and  his  head  was  dragged \\ndownwards.  The  Mirror  seemed  to  be  growing  hot  and  curls \\nof  steam  were  rising  from  the  water.  He  was  slipping  forward. \\n\\n‘Do  not  touch  the  water!’  said  the  Lady  Galadriel  softly. \\nThe  vision  faded,  and  Frodo  found  that  he  was  looking  at \\nthe  cool  stars  twinkling  in  the  silver  basin.  He  stepped  back \\nshaking  all  over  and  looked  at  the  Lady. \\n\\n‘I  know  what  it  was  that  you  last  saw,’  she  said;  ‘for  that  is \\nalso  in  my  mind.  Do  not  be  afraid!  But  do  not  think  that  only \\nby  singing  amid  the  trees,  nor  even  by  the  slender  arrows \\nof  elven-bows,  is  this  land  of  Lothlorien  maintained  and \\ndefended  against  its  Enemy.  I  say  to  you,  Frodo,  that  even \\nas  I  speak  to  you,  I  perceive  the  Dark  Lord  and  know  his \\nmind,  or  all  of  his  mind  that  concerns  the  Elves.  And  he \\ngropes  ever  to  see  me  and  my  thought.  But  still  the  door  is \\nclosed!’ \\n\\nShe  lifted  up  her  white  arms,  and  spread  out  her  hands \\ntowards  the  East  in  a  gesture  of  rejection  and  denial.  Earendil, \\nthe  Evening  Star,  most  beloved  of  the  Elves,  shone  clear \\nabove.  So  bright  was  it  that  the  figure  of  the  Elven-lady  cast \\n\\n\\nTHE  MIRROR  OF  GALADRIEL \\n\\n\\n475 \\n\\n\\na  dim  shadow  on  the  ground.  Its  rays  glanced  upon  a  ring \\nabout  her  finger;  it  glittered  like  polished  gold  overlaid  with \\nsilver  light,  and  a  white  stone  in  it  twinkled  as  if  the  Even- \\nstar  had  come  down  to  rest  upon  her  hand.  Frodo  gazed  at \\nthe  ring  with  awe;  for  suddenly  it  seemed  to  him  that  he \\nunderstood. \\n\\n‘Yes,’  she  said,  divining  his  thought,  ‘it  is  not  permitted  to \\nspeak  of  it,  and  Elrond  could  not  do  so.  But  it  cannot  be \\nhidden  from  the  Ring-bearer,  and  one  who  has  seen  the  Eye. \\nVerily  it  is  in  the  land  of  Lorien  upon  the  finger  of  Galadriel \\nthat  one  of  the  Three  remains.  This  is  Nenya,  the  Ring  of \\nAdamant,  and  I  am  its  keeper. \\n\\n‘He  suspects,  but  he  does  not  know  -  not  yet.  Do  you  not \\nsee  now  wherefore  your  coming  is  to  us  as  the  footstep  of \\nDoom?  For  if  you  fail,  then  we  are  laid  bare  to  the  Enemy. \\nYet  if  you  succeed,  then  our  power  is  diminished,  and \\nLothlorien  will  fade,  and  the  tides  of  Time  will  sweep  it  away. \\nWe  must  depart  into  the  West,  or  dwindle  to  a  rustic  folk  of \\ndell  and  cave,  slowly  to  forget  and  to  be  forgotten.’ \\n\\nFrodo  bent  his  head.  ‘And  what  do  you  wish?’  he  said  at \\nlast. \\n\\n‘That  what  should  be  shall  be,’  she  answered.  ‘The  love  of \\nthe  Elves  for  their  land  and  their  works  is  deeper  than  the \\ndeeps  of  the  Sea,  and  their  regret  is  undying  and  cannot  ever \\nwholly  be  assuaged.  Yet  they  will  cast  all  away  rather  than \\nsubmit  to  Sauron:  for  they  know  him  now.  For  the  fate  of \\nLothlorien  you  are  not  answerable,  but  only  for  the  doing  of \\nyour  own  task.  Yet  I  could  wish,  were  it  of  any  avail,  that  the \\nOne  Ring  had  never  been  wrought,  or  had  remained  for  ever \\nlost.’ \\n\\n‘You  are  wise  and  fearless  and  fair,  Lady  Galadriel,’  said \\nFrodo.  ‘I  will  give  you  the  One  Ring,  if  you  ask  for  it.  It  is \\ntoo  great  a  matter  for  me.’ \\n\\nGaladriel  laughed  with  a  sudden  clear  laugh.  ‘Wise  the \\nLady  Galadriel  may  be,’  she  said,  ‘yet  here  she  has  met  her \\nmatch  in  courtesy.  Gently  are  you  revenged  for  my  testing \\nof  your  heart  at  our  first  meeting.  You  begin  to  see  with  a \\n\\n\\n476 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nkeen  eye.  I  do  not  deny  that  my  heart  has  greatly  desired  to \\nask  what  you  offer.  For  many  long  years  I  had  pondered  what \\nI  might  do,  should  the  Great  Ring  come  into  my  hands,  and \\nbehold!  it  was  brought  within  my  grasp.  The  evil  that  was \\ndevised  long  ago  works  on  in  many  ways,  whether  Sauron \\nhimself  stands  or  falls.  Would  not  that  have  been  a  noble \\ndeed  to  set  to  the  credit  of  his  Ring,  if  I  had  taken  it  by  force \\nor  fear  from  my  guest? \\n\\n‘And  now  at  last  it  comes.  You  will  give  me  the  Ring  freely! \\nIn  place  of  the  Dark  Lord  you  will  set  up  a  Queen.  And  I \\nshall  not  be  dark,  but  beautiful  and  terrible  as  the  Morning \\nand  the  Night!  Fair  as  the  Sea  and  the  Sun  and  the  Snow \\nupon  the  Mountain!  Dreadful  as  the  Storm  and  the  Light¬ \\nning!  Stronger  than  the  foundations  of  the  earth.  All  shall \\nlove  me  and  despair!’ \\n\\nShe  lifted  up  her  hand  and  from  the  ring  that  she  wore \\nthere  issued  a  great  light  that  illumined  her  alone  and  left  all \\nelse  dark.  She  stood  before  Frodo  seeming  now  tall  beyond \\nmeasurement,  and  beautiful  beyond  enduring,  terrible  and \\nworshipful.  Then  she  let  her  hand  fall,  and  the  light  faded, \\nand  suddenly  she  laughed  again,  and  lo!  she  was  shrunken:  a \\nslender  elf-woman,  clad  in  simple  white,  whose  gentle  voice \\nwas  soft  and  sad. \\n\\n‘I  pass  the  test,’  she  said.  ‘I  will  diminish,  and  go  into  the \\nWest,  and  remain  Galadriel.’ \\n\\nThey  stood  for  a  long  while  in  silence.  At  length  the  Lady \\nspoke  again.  ‘Let  us  return!’  she  said.  ‘In  the  morning  you \\nmust  depart,  for  now  we  have  chosen,  and  the  tides  of  fate \\nare  flowing.’ \\n\\n‘I  would  ask  one  thing  before  we  go,’  said  Frodo,  ‘a  thing \\nwhich  I  often  meant  to  ask  Gandalf  in  Rivendell.  I  am  per¬ \\nmitted  to  wear  the  One  Ring:  why  cannot  /  see  all  the  others \\nand  know  the  thoughts  of  those  that  wear  them?’ \\n\\n‘You  have  not  tried,’  she  said.  ‘Only  thrice  have  you  set \\nthe  Ring  upon  your  finger  since  you  knew  what  you  pos¬ \\nsessed.  Do  not  try!  It  would  destroy  you.  Did  not  Gandalf \\n\\n\\nTHE  MIRROR  OF  GALADRIEL \\n\\n\\nMl \\n\\n\\ntell  you  that  the  rings  give  power  according  to  the  measure \\nof  each  possessor?  Before  you  could  use  that  power  you \\nwould  need  to  become  far  stronger,  and  to  train  your  will  to \\nthe  domination  of  others.  Yet  even  so,  as  Ring-bearer  and  as \\none  that  has  borne  it  on  finger  and  seen  that  which  is  hidden, \\nyour  sight  is  grown  keener.  You  have  perceived  my  thought \\nmore  clearly  than  many  that  are  accounted  wise.  You  saw \\nthe  Eye  of  him  that  holds  the  Seven  and  the  Nine.  And  did \\nyou  not  see  and  recognize  the  ring  upon  my  finger?  Did  you \\nsee  my  ring?’  she  asked  turning  again  to  Sam. \\n\\n‘No,  Lady,’  he  answered.  ‘To  tell  you  the  truth,  I  wondered \\nwhat  you  were  talking  about.  I  saw  a  star  through  your \\nfingers.  But  if  you’ll  pardon  my  speaking  out,  I  think  my \\nmaster  was  right.  I  wish  you’d  take  his  Ring.  You’d  put  things \\nto  rights.  You’d  stop  them  digging  up  the  Gaffer  and  turning \\nhim  adrift.  You’d  make  some  folic  pay  for  their  dirty  work.’ \\n\\n‘I  would,’  she  said.  ‘That  is  how  it  would  begin.  But  it \\nwould  not  stop  with  that,  alas!  We  will  not  speak  more  of  it. \\nLet  us  go!’ \\n\\n\\nChapter  8 \\n\\n\\nFAREWELL  TO  LORIEN \\n\\n\\nThat  night  the  Company  was  again  summoned  to  the \\nchamber  of  Celeborn,  and  there  the  Lord  and  Lady  greeted \\nthem  with  fair  words.  At  length  Celeborn  spoke  of  their \\ndeparture. \\n\\n‘Now  is  the  time,’  he  said,  ‘when  those  who  wish  to  con¬ \\ntinue  the  Quest  must  harden  their  hearts  to  leave  this  land. \\nThose  who  no  longer  wish  to  go  forward  may  remain  here, \\nfor  a  while.  But  whether  they  stay  or  go,  none  can  be  sure  of \\npeace.  For  we  are  come  now  to  the  edge  of  doom.  Here  those \\nwho  wish  may  await  the  oncoming  of  the  hour  till  either  the \\nways  of  the  world  lie  open  again,  or  we  summon  them  to  the \\nlast  need  of  Lorien.  Then  they  may  return  to  their  own  lands, \\nor  else  go  to  the  long  home  of  those  that  fall  in  battle.’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  silence.  ‘They  all  resolved  to  go  forward,’  said \\nGaladriel  looking  in  their  eyes. \\n\\n‘As  for  me,’  said  Boromir,  ‘my  way  home  lies  onward  and \\nnot  back.’ \\n\\n‘That  is  true,’  said  Celeborn,  ‘but  is  all  this  Company  going \\nwith  you  to  Minas  Tirith?’ \\n\\n‘We  have  not  decided  our  course,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘Beyond \\nLothlorien  I  do  not  know  what  Gandalf  intended  to  do. \\nIndeed  I  do  not  think  that  even  he  had  any  clear  purpose.’ \\n\\n‘Maybe  not,’  said  Celeborn,  ‘yet  when  you  leave  this  land, \\nyou  can  no  longer  forget  the  Great  River.  As  some  of  you \\nknow  well,  it  cannot  be  crossed  by  travellers  with  baggage \\nbetween  Lorien  and  Gondor,  save  by  boat.  And  are  not  the \\nbridges  of  Osgiliath  broken  down  and  all  the  landings  held \\nnow  by  the  Enemy? \\n\\n‘On  which  side  will  you  journey?  The  way  to  Minas  Tirith \\nlies  upon  this  side,  upon  the  west;  but  the  straight  road  of  the \\n\\n\\nFAREWELL  TO  LORIEN  479 \\n\\nQuest  lies  east  of  the  River,  upon  the  darker  shore.  Which \\nshore  will  you  now  take?’ \\n\\n‘If  my  advice  is  heeded,  it  will  be  the  western  shore,  and \\nthe  way  to  Minas  Tirith,’  answered  Boromir.  ‘But  I  am  not \\nthe  leader  of  the  Company.’  The  others  said  nothing,  and \\nAragorn  looked  doubtful  and  troubled. \\n\\n‘I  see  that  you  do  not  yet  know  what  to  do,’  said  Celeborn. \\n‘It  is  not  my  part  to  choose  for  you;  but  I  will  help  you  as  I \\nmay.  There  are  some  among  you  who  can  handle  boats: \\nLegolas,  whose  folk  know  the  swift  Forest  River;  and  Boromir \\nof  Gondor;  and  Aragorn  the  traveller.’ \\n\\n‘And  one  Hobbit!’  cried  Merry.  ‘Not  all  of  us  look  on \\nboats  as  wild  horses.  My  people  live  by  the  banks  of  the \\nBrandywine.’ \\n\\n‘That  is  well,’  said  Celeborn.  ‘Then  I  will  furnish  your \\nCompany  with  boats.  They  must  be  small  and  light,  for  if \\nyou  go  far  by  water,  there  are  places  where  you  will  be  forced \\nto  carry  them.  You  will  come  to  the  rapids  of  Sarn  Gebir, \\nand  maybe  at  last  to  the  great  falls  of  Rauros  where  the  River \\nthunders  down  from  Nen  Hithoel;  and  there  are  other  perils. \\nBoats  may  make  your  journey  less  toilsome  for  a  while.  Yet \\nthey  will  not  give  you  counsel:  in  the  end  you  must  leave \\nthem  and  the  River,  and  turn  west  -  or  east.’ \\n\\nAragorn  thanked  Celeborn  many  times.  The  gift  of  boats \\ncomforted  him  much,  not  least  because  there  would  now  be \\nno  need  to  decide  his  course  for  some  days.  The  others,  too, \\nlooked  more  hopeful.  Whatever  perils  lay  ahead,  it  seemed \\nbetter  to  float  down  the  broad  tide  of  Anduin  to  meet  them \\nthan  to  plod  forward  with  bent  backs.  Only  Sam  was  doubt¬ \\nful:  he  at  any  rate  still  thought  boats  as  bad  as  wild  horses, \\nor  worse,  and  not  all  the  dangers  that  he  had  survived  made \\nhim  think  better  of  them. \\n\\n‘All  shall  be  prepared  for  you  and  await  you  at  the  haven \\nbefore  noon  tomorrow,’  said  Celeborn.  ‘I  will  send  my  people \\nto  you  in  the  morning  to  help  you  make  ready  for  the  journey. \\nNow  we  will  wish  you  all  a  fair  night  and  untroubled  sleep.’ \\n\\n‘Good  night,  my  friends!’  said  Galadriel.  ‘Sleep  in  peace! \\n\\n\\n480  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nDo  not  trouble  your  hearts  overmuch  with  thought  of  the \\nroad  tonight.  Maybe  the  paths  that  you  each  shall  tread  are \\nalready  laid  before  your  feet,  though  you  do  not  see  them. \\nGood  night!’ \\n\\nThe  Company  now  took  their  leave  and  returned  to  their \\npavilion.  Legolas  went  with  them,  for  this  was  to  be  their  last \\nnight  in  Lothlorien,  and  in  spite  of  the  words  of  Galadriel \\nthey  wished  to  take  counsel  together. \\n\\nFor  a  long  time  they  debated  what  they  should  do,  and \\nhow  it  would  be  best  to  attempt  the  fulfilling  of  their  purpose \\nwith  the  Ring;  but  they  came  to  no  decision.  It  was  plain  that \\nmost  of  them  desired  to  go  first  to  Minas  Tirith,  and  to  escape \\nat  least  for  a  while  from  the  terror  of  the  Enemy.  They  would \\nhave  been  willing  to  follow  a  leader  over  the  River  and \\ninto  the  shadow  of  Mordor;  but  Frodo  spoke  no  word,  and \\nAragorn  was  still  divided  in  his  mind. \\n\\nHis  own  plan,  while  Gandalf  remained  with  them,  had \\nbeen  to  go  with  Boromir,  and  with  his  sword  help  to  deliver \\nGondor.  For  he  believed  that  the  message  of  the  dreams  was \\na  summons,  and  that  the  hour  had  come  at  last  when  the  heir \\nof  Elendil  should  come  forth  and  strive  with  Sauron  for  the \\nmastery.  But  in  Moria  the  burden  of  Gandalf  had  been  laid \\non  him;  and  he  knew  that  he  could  not  now  forsake  the  Ring, \\nif  Frodo  refused  in  the  end  to  go  with  Boromir.  And  yet  what \\nhelp  could  he  or  any  of  the  Company  give  to  Frodo,  save  to \\nwalk  blindly  with  him  into  the  darkness? \\n\\n‘I  shall  go  to  Minas  Tirith,  alone  if  need  be,  for  it  is  my \\nduty,’  said  Boromir;  and  after  that  he  was  silent  for  a  while, \\nsitting  with  his  eyes  fixed  on  Frodo,  as  if  he  was  trying  to \\nread  the  Halfling’s  thoughts.  At  length  he  spoke  again,  softly, \\nas  if  he  was  debating  with  himself.  ‘If  you  wish  only  to  destroy \\nthe  Ring,’  he  said,  ‘then  there  is  little  use  in  war  and  weapons; \\nand  the  Men  of  Minas  Tirith  cannot  help.  But  if  you  wish  to \\ndestroy  the  armed  might  of  the  Dark  Lord,  then  it  is  folly  to \\ngo  without  force  into  his  domain;  and  folly  to  throw  away.’ \\nHe  paused  suddenly,  as  if  he  had  become  aware  that  he  was \\n\\n\\nFAREWELL  TO  LORIEN \\n\\n\\n481 \\n\\n\\nspeaking  his  thoughts  aloud.  ‘It  would  be  folly  to  throw  lives \\naway,  I  mean,’  he  ended.  ‘It  is  a  choice  between  defending  a \\nstrong  place  and  walking  openly  into  the  arms  of  death.  At \\nleast,  that  is  how  I  see  it.’ \\n\\nFrodo  caught  something  new  and  strange  in  Boromir’s \\nglance,  and  he  looked  hard  at  him.  Plainly  Boromir’s  thought \\nwas  different  from  his  final  words.  It  would  be  folly  to  throw \\naway:  what?  The  Ring  of  Power?  He  had  said  something  like \\nthis  at  the  Council,  but  then  he  had  accepted  the  correction \\nof  Elrond.  Frodo  looked  at  Aragorn,  but  he  seemed  deep \\nin  his  own  thought  and  made  no  sign  that  he  had  heeded \\nBoromir’s  words.  And  so  their  debate  ended.  Merry  and \\nPippin  were  already  asleep,  and  Sam  was  nodding.  The  night \\nwas  growing  old. \\n\\nIn  the  morning,  as  they  were  beginning  to  pack  their  slen¬ \\nder  goods,  Elves  that  could  speak  their  tongue  came  to  them \\nand  brought  them  many  gifts  of  food  and  clothing  for  the \\njourney.  The  food  was  mostly  in  the  form  of  very  thin  cakes, \\nmade  of  a  meal  that  was  baked  a  light  brown  on  the  outside, \\nand  inside  was  the  colour  of  cream.  Gimli  took  up  one  of  the \\ncakes  and  looked  at  it  with  a  doubtful  eye. \\n\\n‘ Cram ,’  he  said  under  his  breath,  as  he  broke  off  a  crisp \\ncorner  and  nibbled  at  it.  His  expression  quickly  changed,  and \\nhe  ate  all  the  rest  of  the  cake  with  relish. \\n\\n‘No  more,  no  more!’  cried  the  Elves  laughing.  ‘You  have \\neaten  enough  already  for  a  long  day’s  march.’ \\n\\n‘I  thought  it  was  only  a  kind  of  cram,  such  as  the  Dale-men \\nmake  for  journeys  in  the  wild,’  said  the  Dwarf. \\n\\n‘So  it  is,’  they  answered.  ‘But  we  call  it  lembas  or  waybread, \\nand  it  is  more  strengthening  than  any  food  made  by  Men, \\nand  it  is  more  pleasant  than  cram,  by  all  accounts.’ \\n\\n‘Indeed  it  is,’  said  Gimli.  ‘Why,  it  is  better  than  the  honey- \\ncakes  of  the  Beornings,  and  that  is  great  praise,  for  the \\nBeornings  are  the  best  bakers  that  I  know  of;  but  they  are \\nnone  too  willing  to  deal  out  their  cakes  to  travellers  in  these \\ndays.  You  are  kindly  hosts!’ \\n\\n\\n482  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n‘All  the  same,  we  bid  you  spare  the  food,’  they  said.  ‘Eat \\nlittle  at  a  time,  and  only  at  need.  For  these  things  are  given \\nto  serve  you  when  all  else  fails.  The  cakes  will  keep  sweet \\nfor  many  many  days,  if  they  are  unbroken  and  left  in  their \\nleaf-wrappings,  as  we  have  brought  them.  One  will  keep  a \\ntraveller  on  his  feet  for  a  day  of  long  labour,  even  if  he  be \\none  of  the  tall  Men  of  Minas  Tirith.’ \\n\\nThe  Elves  next  unwrapped  and  gave  to  each  of  the  Com¬ \\npany  the  clothes  they  had  brought.  For  each  they  had  pro¬ \\nvided  a  hood  and  cloak,  made  according  to  his  size,  of  the \\nlight  but  warm  silken  stuff  that  the  Galadhrim  wove.  It  was \\nhard  to  say  of  what  colour  they  were:  grey  with  the  hue  of \\ntwilight  under  the  trees  they  seemed  to  be;  and  yet  if  they \\nwere  moved,  or  set  in  another  light,  they  were  green  as \\nshadowed  leaves,  or  brown  as  fallow  fields  by  night,  dusk- \\nsilver  as  water  under  the  stars.  Each  cloak  was  fastened  about \\nthe  neck  with  a  brooch  like  a  green  leaf  veined  with  silver. \\n\\n‘Are  these  magic  cloaks?’  asked  Pippin,  looking  at  them \\nwith  wonder. \\n\\n‘I  do  not  know  what  you  mean  by  that,’  answered  the \\nleader  of  the  Elves.  ‘They  are  fair  garments,  and  the  web  is \\ngood,  for  it  was  made  in  this  land.  They  are  Elvish  robes \\ncertainly,  if  that  is  what  you  mean.  Leaf  and  branch,  water \\nand  stone:  they  have  the  hue  and  beauty  of  all  these  things \\nunder  the  twilight  of  Lorien  that  we  love;  for  we  put  the \\nthought  of  all  that  we  love  into  all  that  we  make.  Yet  they  are \\ngarments,  not  armour,  and  they  will  not  turn  shaft  or  blade. \\nBut  they  should  serve  you  well:  they  are  light  to  wear,  and \\nwarm  enough  or  cool  enough  at  need.  And  you  will  find  them \\na  great  aid  in  keeping  out  of  the  sight  of  unfriendly  eyes, \\nwhether  you  walk  among  the  stones  or  the  trees.  You  are \\nindeed  high  in  the  favour  of  the  Lady!  For  she  herself  and \\nher  maidens  wove  this  stuff;  and  never  before  have  we  clad \\nstrangers  in  the  garb  of  our  own  people.’ \\n\\nAfter  their  morning  meal  the  Company  said  farewell  to  the \\nlawn  by  the  fountain.  Their  hearts  were  heavy;  for  it  was  a \\n\\n\\nFAREWELL  TO  LORIEN \\n\\n\\n483 \\n\\n\\nfair  place,  and  it  had  become  like  home  to  them,  though  they \\ncould  not  count  the  days  and  nights  that  they  had  passed \\nthere.  As  they  stood  for  a  moment  looking  at  the  white  water \\nin  the  sunlight,  Haldir  came  walking  towards  them  over  the \\ngreen  grass  of  the  glade.  Frodo  greeted  him  with  delight. \\n\\n‘I  have  returned  from  the  Northern  Fences,’  said  the  Elf, \\n‘and  I  am  sent  now  to  be  your  guide  again.  The  Dimrill  Dale \\nis  full  of  vapour  and  clouds  of  smoke,  and  the  mountains  are \\ntroubled.  There  are  noises  in  the  deeps  of  the  earth.  If  any \\nof  you  had  thought  of  returning  northwards  to  your  homes, \\nyou  would  not  have  been  able  to  pass  that  way.  But  come! \\nYour  path  now  goes  south.’ \\n\\nAs  they  walked  through  Caras  Galadhon  the  green  ways \\nwere  empty;  but  in  the  trees  above  them  many  voices  were \\nmurmuring  and  singing.  They  themselves  went  silently.  At \\nlast  Haldir  led  them  down  the  southward  slopes  of  the  hill, \\nand  they  came  again  to  the  great  gate  hung  with  lamps,  and \\nto  the  white  bridge;  and  so  they  passed  out  and  left  the  city \\nof  the  Elves.  Then  they  turned  away  from  the  paved  road \\nand  took  a  path  that  went  off  into  a  deep  thicket  of  mallorn- \\ntrees,  and  passed  on,  winding  through  rolling  woodlands  of \\nsilver  shadow,  leading  them  ever  down,  southwards  and  east¬ \\nwards,  towards  the  shores  of  the  River. \\n\\nThey  had  gone  some  ten  miles  and  noon  was  at  hand \\nwhen  they  came  on  a  high  green  wall.  Passing  through  an \\nopening  they  came  suddenly  out  of  the  trees.  Before  them \\nlay  a  long  lawn  of  shining  grass,  studded  with  golden  elanor \\nthat  glinted  in  the  sun.  The  lawn  ran  out  into  a  narrow  tongue \\nbetween  bright  margins:  on  the  right  and  west  the  Silverlode \\nflowed  glittering;  on  the  left  and  east  the  Great  River  rolled \\nits  broad  waters,  deep  and  dark.  On  the  further  shores  the \\nwoodlands  still  marched  on  southwards  as  far  as  eye  could \\nsee,  but  all  the  banks  were  bleak  and  bare.  No  mallorn  lifted \\nits  gold-hung  boughs  beyond  the  Land  of  Lorien. \\n\\nOn  the  hank  of  the  Silverlode,  at  some  distance  up  from \\nthe  meeting  of  the  streams,  there  was  a  hythe  of  white  stones \\nand  white  wood.  By  it  were  moored  many  boats  and  barges. \\n\\n\\n484  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nSome  were  brightly  painted,  and  shone  with  silver  and  gold \\nand  green,  but  most  were  either  white  or  grey.  Three  small \\ngrey  boats  had  been  made  ready  for  the  travellers,  and  in \\nthese  the  Elves  stowed  their  goods.  And  they  added  also  coils \\nof  rope,  three  to  each  boat.  Slender  they  looked,  but  strong, \\nsilken  to  the  touch,  grey  of  hue  like  the  elven-cloaks. \\n\\n‘What  are  these?’  asked  Sam,  handling  one  that  lay  upon \\nthe  greensward. \\n\\n‘Ropes  indeed!’  answered  an  Elf  from  the  boats.  ‘Never \\ntravel  far  without  a  rope!  And  one  that  is  long  and  strong  and \\nlight.  Such  are  these.  They  may  be  a  help  in  many  needs.’ \\n\\n‘You  don’t  need  to  tell  me  that!’  said  Sam.  ‘I  came  without \\nany,  and  I’ve  been  worried  ever  since.  But  I  was  wondering \\nwhat  these  were  made  of,  knowing  a  bit  about  rope-making: \\nit’s  in  the  family  as  you  might  say.’ \\n\\n‘They  are  made  of  hithlain,’  said  the  Elf,  ‘but  there  is  no \\ntime  now  to  instruct  you  in  the  art  of  their  making.  Had  we \\nknown  that  this  craft  delighted  you,  we  could  have  taught \\nyou  much.  But  now  alas!  unless  you  should  at  some  time \\nreturn  hither,  you  must  be  content  with  our  gift.  May  it  serve \\nyou  well!’ \\n\\n‘Come!’  said  Haldir.  ‘All  is  now  ready  for  you.  Enter  the \\nboats!  But  take  care  at  first!’ \\n\\n‘Heed  the  words!’  said  the  other  Elves.  ‘These  boats  are \\nlight-built,  and  they  are  crafty  and  unlike  the  boats  of  other \\nfolic.  They  will  not  sink,  lade  them  as  you  will;  but  they  are \\nwayward  if  mishandled.  It  would  be  wise  if  you  accustomed \\nyourselves  to  stepping  in  and  out,  here  where  there  is  a \\nlanding-place,  before  you  set  off  downstream.’ \\n\\nThe  Company  was  arranged  in  this  way:  Aragorn,  Frodo, \\nand  Sam  were  in  one  boat;  Boromir,  Merry,  and  Pippin  in \\nanother;  and  in  the  third  were  Legolas  and  Gimli,  who  had \\nnow  become  fast  friends.  In  this  last  boat  most  of  the  goods \\nand  packs  were  stowed.  The  boats  were  moved  and  steered \\nwith  short-handled  paddles  that  had  broad  leaf-shaped \\nblades.  When  all  was  ready  Aragorn  led  them  on  a  trial  up \\n\\n\\nFAREWELL  TO  LORIEN \\n\\n\\n485 \\n\\n\\nthe  Silverlode.  The  current  was  swift  and  they  went  forward \\nslowly.  Sam  sat  in  the  bows,  clutching  the  sides,  and  looking \\nback  wistfully  to  the  shore.  The  sunlight  glittering  on  the \\nwater  dazzled  his  eyes.  As  they  passed  beyond  the  green  field \\nof  the  Tongue,  the  trees  drew  down  to  the  river’s  brink.  Here \\nand  there  golden  leaves  tossed  and  floated  on  the  rippling \\nstream.  The  air  was  very  bright  and  still,  and  there  was  a \\nsilence,  except  for  the  high  distant  song  of  larks. \\n\\nThey  turned  a  sharp  bend  in  the  river,  and  there,  sailing \\nproudly  down  the  stream  towards  them,  they  saw  a  swan  of \\ngreat  size.  The  water  rippled  on  either  side  of  the  white  breast \\nbeneath  its  curving  neck.  Its  beak  shone  like  burnished  gold, \\nand  its  eyes  glinted  like  jet  set  in  yellow  stones;  its  huge  white \\nwings  were  half  lifted.  A  music  came  down  the  river  as  it \\ndrew  nearer;  and  suddenly  they  perceived  that  it  was  a  ship, \\nwrought  and  carved  with  elven-skill  in  the  likeness  of  a  bird. \\nTwo  elves  clad  in  white  steered  it  with  black  paddles.  In \\nthe  midst  of  the  vessel  sat  Celeborn,  and  behind  him  stood \\nGaladriel,  tall  and  white;  a  circlet  of  golden  flowers  was  in \\nher  hair,  and  in  her  hand  she  held  a  harp,  and  she  sang.  Sad \\nand  sweet  was  the  sound  of  her  voice  in  the  cool  clear  air: \\n\\nI  sang  of  leaves,  of  leaves  of  gold,  and  leaves  of  gold  there \\ngrew: \\n\\nOf  wind  I  sang,  a  wind  there  came  and  in  the  branches  blew. \\n\\nBeyond  the  Sim,  beyond  the  Moon,  the  foam  was  on  the  Sea, \\n\\nAnd  by  the  strand  ofllmarin  there  grew  a  golden  Tree. \\n\\nBeneath  the  stars  of  Ever- eve  in  Eldamar  it  shone, \\n\\nIn  Eldamar  beside  the  walls  of  Elven  Tirion. \\n\\nThere  long  the  golden  leaves  have  grown  upon  the  branching \\nyears. \\n\\nWhile  here  beyond  the  Sundering  Seas  now  fall  the  Elven- \\ntears. \\n\\nO  Lorien!  The  Winter  comes,  the  bare  and  leafless  Day; \\n\\nThe  leaves  are  falling  in  the  stream,  the  River  flows  away. \\n\\nO  Lorien!  Too  long  I  have  dwelt  upon  this  Hither  Shore \\n\\nAnd  in  a  fading  crown  have  twined  the  golden  elanor. \\n\\n\\n486 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nBut  if  of  ships  I  now  should  sing,  what  ship  would  come  to \\nme, \\n\\nWhat  ship  would  bear  me  ever  back  across  so  wide  a  Sea? \\n\\nAragorn  stayed  his  boat  as  the  Swan-ship  drew  alongside. \\nThe  Lady  ended  her  song  and  greeted  them.  ‘We  have  come \\nto  bid  our  last  farewell,’  she  said,  ‘and  to  speed  you  with \\nblessings  from  our  land.’ \\n\\n‘Though  you  have  been  our  guests,’  said  Celeborn,  ‘you \\nhave  not  yet  eaten  with  us,  and  we  bid  you,  therefore,  to  a \\nparting  feast,  here  between  the  flowing  waters  that  will  bear \\nyou  far  from  Lorien.’ \\n\\nThe  Swan  passed  on  slowly  to  the  hythe,  and  they  turned \\ntheir  boats  and  followed  it.  There  in  the  last  end  of  Egladil \\nupon  the  green  grass  the  parting  feast  was  held;  but  Frodo \\nate  and  drank  little,  heeding  only  the  beauty  of  the  Lady  and \\nher  voice.  She  seemed  no  longer  perilous  or  terrible,  nor  filled \\nwith  hidden  power.  Already  she  seemed  to  him,  as  by  men \\nof  later  days  Elves  still  at  times  are  seen:  present  and  yet \\nremote,  a  living  vision  of  that  which  has  already  been  left  far \\nbehind  by  the  flowing  streams  of  Time. \\n\\nAfter  they  had  eaten  and  drunk,  sitting  upon  the  grass, \\nCeleborn  spoke  to  them  again  of  their  journey,  and  lifting  his \\nhand  he  pointed  south  to  the  woods  beyond  the  Tongue. \\n\\n‘As  you  go  down  the  water,’  he  said,  ‘you  will  find  that  the \\ntrees  will  fail,  and  you  will  come  to  a  barren  country.  There \\nthe  River  flows  in  stony  vales  amid  high  moors,  until  at  last \\nafter  many  leagues  it  comes  to  the  tall  island  of  the  Tindrock, \\nthat  we  call  Tol  Brandir.  There  it  casts  its  arms  about  the \\nsteep  shores  of  the  isle,  and  falls  then  with  a  great  noise  and \\nsmoke  over  the  cataracts  of  Rauros  down  into  the  Nindalf, \\nthe  Wetwang  as  it  is  called  in  your  tongue.  That  is  a  wide \\nregion  of  sluggish  fen  where  the  stream  becomes  tortuous \\nand  much  divided.  There  the  Entwash  flows  in  by  many \\nmouths  from  the  Forest  of  Fangorn  in  the  west.  About  that \\nstream,  on  this  side  of  the  Great  River,  lies  Rohan.  On  the \\n\\n\\nFAREWELL  TO  LORIEN \\n\\n\\n487 \\n\\n\\nfurther  side  are  the  bleak  hills  of  the  Emyn  Muil.  The  wind \\nblows  from  the  East  there,  for  they  look  out  over  the  Dead \\nMarshes  and  the  Noman-lands  to  Cirith  Gorgor  and  the \\nblack  gates  of  Mordor. \\n\\n‘Boromir,  and  any  that  go  with  him  seeking  Minas  Tirith, \\nwill  do  well  to  leave  the  Great  River  above  Rauros  and  cross \\nthe  Entwash  before  it  finds  the  marshes.  Yet  they  should  not \\ngo  too  far  up  that  stream,  nor  risk  becoming  entangled  in  the \\nForest  of  Fangorn.  That  is  a  strange  land,  and  is  now  little \\nknown.  But  Boromir  and  Aragorn  doubtless  do  not  need  this \\nwarning.’ \\n\\n‘Indeed  we  have  heard  of  Fangorn  in  Minas  Tirith,’  said \\nBoromir.  ‘But  what  I  have  heard  seems  to  me  for  the  most \\npart  old  wives’  tales,  such  as  we  tell  to  our  children.  All  that \\nlies  north  of  Rohan  is  now  to  us  so  far  away  that  fancy  can \\nwander  freely  there.  Of  old  Fangorn  lay  upon  the  borders  of \\nour  realm;  but  it  is  now  many  lives  of  men  since  any  of  us \\nvisited  it,  to  prove  or  disprove  the  legends  that  have  come \\ndown  from  distant  years. \\n\\n‘I  have  myself  been  at  whiles  in  Rohan,  but  I  have  never \\ncrossed  it  northwards.  When  I  was  sent  out  as  a  messenger, \\nI  passed  through  the  Gap  by  the  skirts  of  the  White  Moun¬ \\ntains,  and  crossed  the  Isen  and  the  Greyflood  into  Norther- \\nland.  A  long  and  wearisome  journey.  Four  hundred  leagues \\nI  reckoned  it,  and  it  took  me  many  months;  for  I  lost  my \\nhorse  at  Tharbad,  at  the  fording  of  the  Greyflood.  After  that \\njourney,  and  the  road  I  have  trodden  with  this  Company,  I \\ndo  not  much  doubt  that  I  shall  find  a  way  through  Rohan, \\nand  Fangorn  too,  if  need  be.’ \\n\\n‘Then  I  need  say  no  more,’  said  Celeborn.  ‘But  do  not \\ndespise  the  lore  that  has  come  down  from  distant  years;  for \\noft  it  may  chance  that  old  wives  keep  in  memory  word  of \\nthings  that  once  were  needful  for  the  wise  to  know.’ \\n\\nNow  Galadriel  rose  from  the  grass,  and  taking  a  cup  from \\none  of  her  maidens  she  filled  it  with  white  mead  and  gave  it \\nto  Celeborn. \\n\\n\\n488 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘Now  it  is  time  to  drink  the  cup  of  farewell,’  she  said. \\n‘Drink,  Lord  of  the  Galadhrim!  And  let  not  your  heart  be \\nsad,  though  night  must  follow  noon,  and  already  our  evening \\ndraweth  nigh.’ \\n\\nThen  she  brought  the  cup  to  each  of  the  Company,  and \\nbade  them  drink  and  farewell.  But  when  they  had  drunk  she \\ncommanded  them  to  sit  again  on  the  grass,  and  chairs  were \\nset  for  her  and  for  Celeborn.  Her  maidens  stood  silent  about \\nher,  and  a  while  she  looked  upon  her  guests.  At  last  she  spoke \\nagain. \\n\\n‘We  have  drunk  the  cup  of  parting,’  she  said,  ‘and  the \\nshadows  fall  between  us.  But  before  you  go,  I  have  brought \\nin  my  ship  gifts  which  the  Lord  and  Lady  of  the  Galadhrim \\nnow  offer  you  in  memory  of  Lothlorien.’  Then  she  called  to \\neach  in  turn. \\n\\n‘Here  is  the  gift  of  Celeborn  and  Galadriel  to  the  leader  of \\nyour  Company,’  she  said  to  Aragorn,  and  she  gave  him  a \\nsheath  that  had  been  made  to  fit  his  sword.  It  was  overlaid \\nwith  a  tracery  of  flowers  and  leaves  wrought  of  silver  and \\ngold,  and  on  it  were  set  in  elven-runes  formed  of  many  gems \\nthe  name  Anduril  and  the  lineage  of  the  sword. \\n\\n‘The  blade  that  is  drawn  from  this  sheath  shall  not  be \\nstained  or  broken  even  in  defeat,’  she  said.  ‘But  is  there  aught \\nelse  that  you  desire  of  me  at  our  parting?  For  darkness  will \\nflow  between  us,  and  it  may  be  that  we  shall  not  meet  again, \\nunless  it  be  far  hence  upon  a  road  that  has  no  returning.’ \\n\\nAnd  Aragorn  answered:  ‘Lady,  you  know  all  my  desire, \\nand  long  held  in  keeping  the  only  treasure  that  I  seek.  Yet  it \\nis  not  yours  to  give  me,  even  if  you  would;  and  only  through \\ndarkness  shall  I  come  to  it.’ \\n\\n‘Yet  maybe  this  will  lighten  your  heart,’  said  Galadriel;  ‘for \\nit  was  left  in  my  care  to  be  given  to  you,  should  you  pass \\nthrough  this  land.’  Then  she  lifted  from  her  lap  a  great  stone \\nof  a  clear  green,  set  in  a  silver  brooch  that  was  wrought  in \\nthe  likeness  of  an  eagle  with  outspread  wings;  and  as  she  held \\nit  up  the  gem  flashed  like  the  sun  shining  through  the  leaves \\nof  spring.  ‘This  stone  I  gave  to  Celebrian  my  daughter,  and \\n\\n\\nFAREWELL  TO  LORIEN \\n\\n\\n489 \\n\\n\\nshe  to  hers;  and  now  it  comes  to  you  as  a  token  of  hope.  In \\nthis  hour  take  the  name  that  was  foretold  for  you,  Elessar, \\nthe  Elfstone  of  the  House  of  Elendil!’ \\n\\nThen  Aragorn  took  the  stone  and  pinned  the  brooch  upon \\nhis  breast,  and  those  who  saw  him  wondered;  for  they  had \\nnot  marked  before  how  tall  and  kingly  he  stood,  and  it  seemed \\nto  them  that  many  years  of  toil  had  fallen  from  his  shoulders. \\n‘For  the  gifts  that  you  have  given  me  I  thank  you,’  he  said, \\n‘O  Lady  of  Lorien  of  whom  were  sprung  Celebrian  and \\nArwen  Evenstar.  What  praise  could  I  say  more?’ \\n\\nThe  Lady  bowed  her  head,  and  she  turned  then  to  Boro- \\nmir,  and  to  him  she  gave  a  belt  of  gold;  and  to  Merry  and \\nPippin  she  gave  small  silver  belts,  each  with  a  clasp  wrought \\nlike  a  golden  flower.  To  Legolas  she  gave  a  bow  such  as \\nthe  Galadhrim  used,  longer  and  stouter  than  the  bows  of \\nMirkwood,  and  strung  with  a  string  of  elf-hair.  With  it  went \\na  quiver  of  arrows. \\n\\n‘For  you  little  gardener  and  lover  of  trees,’  she  said  to  Sam, \\n‘I  have  only  a  small  gift.’  She  put  into  his  hand  a  little  box  of \\nplain  grey  wood,  unadorned  save  for  a  single  silver  rune  upon \\nthe  lid.  ‘Here  is  set  G  for  Galadriel,’  she  said;  ‘but  also  it  may \\nstand  for  garden  in  your  tongue.  In  this  box  there  is  earth \\nfrom  my  orchard,  and  such  blessing  as  Galadriel  has  still  to \\nbestow  is  upon  it.  It  will  not  keep  you  on  your  road,  nor \\ndefend  you  against  any  peril;  but  if  you  keep  it  and  see  your \\nhome  again  at  last,  then  perhaps  it  may  reward  you.  Though \\nyou  should  find  all  barren  and  laid  waste,  there  will  be  few \\ngardens  in  Middle-earth  that  will  bloom  like  your  garden, \\nif  you  sprinkle  this  earth  there.  Then  you  may  remember \\nGaladriel,  and  catch  a  glimpse  far  off  of  Lorien,  that  you \\nhave  seen  only  in  our  winter.  For  our  Spring  and  our  Summer \\nare  gone  by,  and  they  will  never  be  seen  on  earth  again  save \\nin  memory.’ \\n\\nSam  went  red  to  the  ears  and  muttered  something  inaud¬ \\nible,  as  he  clutched  the  box  and  bowed  as  well  as  he  could. \\n\\n‘And  what  gift  would  a  Dwarf  ask  of  the  Elves?’  said \\nGaladriel,  turning  to  Gimli. \\n\\n\\n490 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘None,  Lady,’  answered  Gimli.  ‘It  is  enough  for  me  to  have \\nseen  the  Lady  of  the  Galadhrim,  and  to  have  heard  her  gentle \\nwords.’ \\n\\n‘Hear  all  ye  Elves!’  she  cried  to  those  about  her.  ‘Let  none \\nsay  again  that  Dwarves  are  grasping  and  ungracious!  Yet \\nsurely,  Gimli  son  of  Gloin,  you  desire  something  that  I  could \\ngive?  Name  it,  I  bid  you!  You  shall  not  be  the  only  guest \\nwithout  a  gift.’ \\n\\n‘There  is  nothing,  Lady  Galadriel,’  said  Gimli,  bowing  low \\nand  stammering.  ‘Nothing,  unless  it  might  be  -  unless  it  is \\npermitted  to  ask,  nay,  to  name  a  single  strand  of  your  hair, \\nwhich  surpasses  the  gold  of  the  earth  as  the  stars  surpass  the \\ngems  of  the  mine.  I  do  not  ask  for  such  a  gift.  But  you \\ncommanded  me  to  name  my  desire.’ \\n\\nThe  Elves  stirred  and  murmured  with  astonishment,  and \\nCeleborn  gazed  at  the  Dwarf  in  wonder,  but  the  Lady  smiled. \\n‘It  is  said  that  the  skill  of  the  Dwarves  is  in  their  hands  rather \\nthan  in  their  tongues,’  she  said;  ‘yet  that  is  not  true  of  Gimli. \\nFor  none  have  ever  made  to  me  a  request  so  bold  and  yet  so \\ncourteous.  And  how  shall  I  refuse,  since  I  commanded  him \\nto  speak?  But  tell  me,  what  would  you  do  with  such  a  gift?’ \\n\\n‘Treasure  it,  Lady,’  he  answered,  ‘in  memory  of  your \\nwords  to  me  at  our  first  meeting.  And  if  ever  I  return  to  the \\nsmithies  of  my  home,  it  shall  be  set  in  imperishable  crystal \\nto  be  an  heirloom  of  my  house,  and  a  pledge  of  good  will \\nbetween  the  Mountain  and  the  Wood  until  the  end  of \\ndays.’ \\n\\nThen  the  Lady  unbraided  one  of  her  long  tresses,  and  cut \\noff  three  golden  hairs,  and  laid  them  in  Gimli’s  hand.  ‘These \\nwords  shall  go  with  the  gift,’  she  said.  ‘I  do  not  foretell,  for \\nall  foretelling  is  now  vain:  on  the  one  hand  lies  darkness,  and \\non  the  other  only  hope.  But  if  hope  should  not  fail,  then  I \\nsay  to  you,  Gimli  son  of  Gloin,  that  your  hands  shall  flow \\nwith  gold,  and  yet  over  you  gold  shall  have  no  dominion. \\n\\n‘And  you,  Ring-bearer,’  she  said,  turning  to  Frodo.  ‘I  come \\nto  you  last  who  are  not  last  in  my  thoughts.  For  you  I  have \\nprepared  this.’  She  held  up  a  small  crystal  phial:  it  glittered \\n\\n\\nFAREWELL  TO  LORIEN \\n\\n\\n491 \\n\\n\\nas  she  moved  it,  and  rays  of  white  light  sprang  from  her  hand. \\n‘In  this  phial,’  she  said,  ‘is  caught  the  light  of  Earendil’s  star, \\nset  amid  the  waters  of  my  fountain.  It  will  shine  still  brighter \\nwhen  night  is  about  you.  May  it  be  a  light  to  you  in  dark \\nplaces,  when  all  other  lights  go  out.  Remember  Galadriel  and \\nher  Mirror!’ \\n\\nFrodo  took  the  phial,  and  for  a  moment  as  it  shone  between \\nthem,  he  saw  her  again  standing  like  a  queen,  great  and \\nbeautiful,  but  no  longer  terrible.  He  bowed,  but  found  no \\nwords  to  say. \\n\\nNow  the  Lady  arose,  and  Celeborn  led  them  back  to  the \\nhythe.  A  yellow  noon  lay  on  the  green  land  of  the  Tongue, \\nand  the  water  glittered  with  silver.  All  at  last  was  made  ready. \\nThe  Company  took  their  places  in  the  boats  as  before.  Crying \\nfarewell,  the  Elves  of  Lorien  with  long  grey  poles  thrust  them \\nout  into  the  flowing  stream,  and  the  rippling  waters  bore \\nthem  slowly  away.  The  travellers  sat  still  without  moving  or \\nspeaking.  On  the  green  hank  near  to  the  very  point  of  the \\nTongue  the  Lady  Galadriel  stood  alone  and  silent.  As  they \\npassed  her  they  turned  and  their  eyes  watched  her  slowly \\nfloating  away  from  them.  For  so  it  seemed  to  them:  Lorien \\nwas  slipping  backward,  like  a  bright  ship  masted  with \\nenchanted  trees,  sailing  on  to  forgotten  shores,  while  they  sat \\nhelpless  upon  the  margin  of  the  grey  and  leafless  world. \\n\\nEven  as  they  gazed,  the  Silverlode  passed  out  into  the \\ncurrents  of  the  Great  River,  and  their  boats  turned  and  began \\nto  speed  southward.  Soon  the  white  form  of  the  Lady  was \\nsmall  and  distant.  She  shone  like  a  window  of  glass  upon  a \\nfar  hill  in  the  westering  sun,  or  as  a  remote  lake  seen  from  a \\nmountain:  a  crystal  fallen  in  the  lap  of  the  land.  Then  it \\nseemed  to  Frodo  that  she  lifted  her  arms  in  a  final  farewell, \\nand  far  but  piercing-clear  on  the  following  wind  came  the \\nsound  of  her  voice  singing.  But  now  she  sang  in  the  ancient \\ntongue  of  the  Elves  beyond  the  Sea,  and  he  did  not  under¬ \\nstand  the  words:  fair  was  the  music,  but  it  did  not  comfort \\nhim. \\n\\n\\n492 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nYet  as  is  the  way  of  Elvish  words,  they  remained  graven  in \\nhis  memory,  and  long  afterwards  he  interpreted  them,  as  well \\nas  he  could:  the  language  was  that  of  Elven-song  and  spoke \\nof  things  little  known  on  Middle-earth. \\n\\nAi!  laurie  lantar  lassi  surinen, \\nyeni  unotime  ve  ramar  aldaron! \\n\\nYeni  ve  linte  yuldar  avanier \\nmi  oromardi  lisse-miruvoreva \\nAndurie  pella,  Vardo  tellumar \\nnil  luini  yassen  tintilar  i  eleni \\nomaryo  airetdri-lirinen. \\n\\nSi  man  iyulma  nin  enquantuva? \\n\\nAn  si  Tintalle  Varda  Oiolosseo \\nve  fanyar  maryat  Elentdri  ortane, \\nar  ilye  tier  undulave  lumbule; \\nar  sindanoriello  caita  mornie \\ni  falmalinnar  imbe  met,  ar  hisie \\nuntupa  Calaciryo  miri  oiale. \\n\\nSi  vanwa  na,  Romello  vanwa,  Valimar! \\n\\nNamarie!  Nai  hiruvalye  Valimar. \\n\\nNai  elye  hiruva.  Namarie! \\n\\n‘Ah!  like  gold  fall  the  leaves  in  the  wind,  long  years  number¬ \\nless  as  the  wings  of  trees!  The  years  have  passed  like  swift \\ndraughts  of  the  sweet  mead  in  lofty  halls  beyond  the  West, \\nbeneath  the  blue  vaults  of  Varda  wherein  the  stars  tremble \\nin  the  song  of  her  voice,  holy  and  queenly.  Who  now  shall \\nrefill  the  cup  for  me?  For  now  the  Kindler,  Varda,  the  Queen \\nof  the  Stars,  from  Mount  Everwhite  has  uplifted  her  hands \\nlike  clouds,  and  all  paths  are  drowned  deep  in  shadow;  and \\nout  of  a  grey  country  darkness  lies  on  the  foaming  waves \\nbetween  us,  and  mist  covers  the  jewels  of  Calacirya  for  ever. \\nNow  lost,  lost  to  those  from  the  East  is  Valimar!  Farewell! \\n\\n\\nFAREWELL  TO  LORIEN \\n\\n\\n493 \\n\\n\\nMaybe  thou  shalt  find  Valimar.  Maybe  even  thou  shalt  find \\nit.  Farewell!’  Varda  is  the  name  of  that  Lady  whom  the  Elves \\nin  these  lands  of  exile  name  Elbereth. \\n\\nSuddenly  the  River  swept  round  a  bend,  and  the  banks \\nrose  upon  either  side,  and  the  light  of  Lorien  was  hidden.  To \\nthat  fair  land  Frodo  never  came  again. \\n\\nThe  travellers  now  turned  their  faces  to  the  journey;  the \\nsun  was  before  them,  and  their  eyes  were  dazzled,  for  all  were \\nfilled  with  tears.  Gimli  wept  openly. \\n\\n‘I  have  looked  the  last  upon  that  which  was  fairest,’  he  said \\nto  Legolas  his  companion.  ‘Henceforward  I  will  call  nothing \\nfair,  unless  it  be  her  gift.’  He  put  his  hand  to  his  breast. \\n\\n‘Tell  me,  Legolas,  why  did  I  come  on  this  Quest?  Little \\ndid  I  know  where  the  chief  peril  lay!  Truly  Elrond  spoke, \\nsaying  that  we  could  not  foresee  what  we  might  meet  upon \\nour  road.  Torment  in  the  dark  was  the  danger  that  I  feared, \\nand  it  did  not  hold  me  back.  But  I  would  not  have  come,  had \\nI  known  the  danger  of  light  and  joy.  Now  I  have  taken  my \\nworst  wound  in  this  parting,  even  if  I  were  to  go  this  night \\nstraight  to  the  Dark  Lord.  Alas  for  Gimli  son  of  Gloin!’ \\n\\n‘Nay!’  said  Legolas.  ‘Alas  for  us  all!  And  for  all  that  walk \\nthe  world  in  these  after-days.  For  such  is  the  way  of  it:  to \\nfind  and  lose,  as  it  seems  to  those  whose  boat  is  on  the \\nrunning  stream.  But  I  count  you  blessed,  Gimli  son  of  Gloin: \\nfor  your  loss  you  suffer  of  your  own  free  will,  and  you  might \\nhave  chosen  otherwise.  But  you  have  not  forsaken  your  com¬ \\npanions,  and  the  least  reward  that  you  shall  have  is  that  the \\nmemory  of  Lothlorien  shall  remain  ever  clear  and  unstained \\nin  your  heart,  and  shall  neither  fade  nor  grow  stale.’ \\n\\n‘Maybe,’  said  Gimli;  ‘and  I  thank  you  for  your  words.  True \\nwords  doubtless;  yet  all  such  comfort  is  cold.  Memory  is  not \\nwhat  the  heart  desires.  That  is  only  a  mirror,  be  it  clear  as \\nKheled-zaram.  Or  so  says  the  heart  of  Gimli  the  Dwarf.  Elves \\nmay  see  things  otherwise.  Indeed  I  have  heard  that  for  them \\nmemory  is  more  like  to  the  waking  world  than  to  a  dream. \\nNot  so  for  Dwarves. \\n\\n\\n494 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\n‘But  let  us  talk  no  more  of  it.  Look  to  the  boat!  She  is  too \\nlow  in  the  water  with  all  this  baggage,  and  the  Great  River  is \\nswift.  I  do  not  wish  to  drown  my  grief  in  cold  water.’  He  took \\nup  a  paddle,  and  steered  towards  the  western  bank,  following \\nAragorn’s  boat  ahead,  which  had  already  moved  out  of  the \\nmiddle  stream. \\n\\nSo  the  Company  went  on  their  long  way,  down  the  wide \\nhurrying  waters,  borne  ever  southwards.  Bare  woods  stalked \\nalong  either  bank,  and  they  could  not  see  any  glimpse  of  the \\nlands  behind.  The  breeze  died  away  and  the  River  flowed \\nwithout  a  sound.  No  voice  of  bird  broke  the  silence.  The  sun \\ngrew  misty  as  the  day  grew  old,  until  it  gleamed  in  a  pale  sky \\nlike  a  high  white  pearl.  Then  it  faded  into  the  West,  and  dusk \\ncame  early,  followed  by  a  grey  and  starless  night.  Far  into \\nthe  dark  quiet  hours  they  floated  on,  guiding  their  boats  under \\nthe  overhanging  shadows  of  the  western  woods.  Great  trees \\npassed  by  like  ghosts,  thrusting  their  twisted  thirsty  roots \\nthrough  the  mist  down  into  the  water.  It  was  dreary  and  cold. \\nFrodo  sat  and  listened  to  the  faint  lap  and  gurgle  of  the  River \\nfretting  among  the  tree-roots  and  driftwood  near  the  shore, \\nuntil  his  head  nodded  and  he  fell  into  an  uneasy  sleep. \\n\\n\\nChapter  9 \\n\\n\\nTHE  GREAT  RIVER \\n\\n\\nFrodo  was  roused  by  Sam.  He  found  that  he  was  lying,  well \\nwrapped,  under  tall  grey-skinned  trees  in  a  quiet  corner  of \\nthe  woodlands  on  the  west  bank  of  the  Great  River,  Anduin. \\nHe  had  slept  the  night  away,  and  the  grey  of  morning  was \\ndim  among  the  bare  branches.  Gimli  was  busy  with  a  small \\nfire  near  at  hand. \\n\\nThey  started  again  before  the  day  was  broad.  Not  that \\nmost  of  the  Company  were  eager  to  hurry  southwards:  they \\nwere  content  that  the  decision,  which  they  must  make  at  latest \\nwhen  they  came  to  Rauros  and  the  Tindrock  Isle,  still  lay \\nsome  days  ahead;  and  they  let  the  River  bear  them  on  at  its \\nown  pace,  having  no  desire  to  hasten  towards  the  perils  that \\nlay  beyond,  whichever  course  they  took  in  the  end.  Aragorn \\nlet  them  drift  with  the  stream  as  they  wished,  husbanding \\ntheir  strength  against  weariness  to  come.  But  he  insisted  that \\nat  least  they  should  start  early  each  day  and  journey  on  far \\ninto  the  evening;  for  he  felt  in  his  heart  that  time  was  pressing, \\nand  he  feared  that  the  Dark  Lord  had  not  been  idle  while \\nthey  lingered  in  Lorien. \\n\\nNonetheless  they  saw  no  sign  of  any  enemy  that  day,  nor \\nthe  next.  The  dull  grey  hours  passed  without  event.  As  the \\nthird  day  of  their  voyage  wore  on  the  lands  changed  slowly: \\nthe  trees  thinned  and  then  failed  altogether.  On  the  eastern \\nbank  to  their  left  they  saw  long  formless  slopes  stretching  up \\nand  away  towards  the  sky;  brown  and  withered  they  looked, \\nas  if  fire  had  passed  over  them,  leaving  no  living  blade  of \\ngreen:  an  unfriendly  waste  without  even  a  broken  tree  or  a \\nbold  stone  to  relieve  the  emptiness.  They  had  come  to  the \\nBrown  Lands  that  lay,  vast  and  desolate,  between  Southern \\nMirkwood  and  the  hills  of  the  Emyn  Muil.  What  pestilence \\n\\n\\n496 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nor  war  or  evil  deed  of  the  Enemy  had  so  blasted  all  that  region \\neven  Aragorn  could  not  tell. \\n\\nUpon  the  west  to  their  right  the  land  was  treeless  also,  but \\nit  was  flat,  and  in  many  places  green  with  wide  plains  of \\ngrass.  On  this  side  of  the  River  they  passed  forests  of  great \\nreeds,  so  tall  that  they  shut  out  all  view  to  the  west,  as  the \\nlittle  boats  went  rustling  by  along  their  fluttering  borders. \\nTheir  dark  withered  plumes  bent  and  tossed  in  the  light  cold \\nairs,  hissing  softly  and  sadly.  Here  and  there  through  open¬ \\nings  Frodo  could  catch  sudden  glimpses  of  rolling  meads, \\nand  far  beyond  them  hills  in  the  sunset,  and  away  on  the \\nedge  of  sight  a  dark  line,  where  marched  the  southernmost \\nranks  of  the  Misty  Mountains. \\n\\nThere  was  no  sign  of  living  moving  things,  save  birds.  Of \\nthese  there  were  many:  small  fowl  whistling  and  piping  in  the \\nreeds,  but  they  were  seldom  seen.  Once  or  twice  the  travellers \\nheard  the  rush  and  whine  of  swan-wings,  and  looking  up  they \\nsaw  a  great  phalanx  streaming  along  the  sky. \\n\\n‘Swans!’  said  Sam.  ‘And  mighty  big  ones  too!’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  Aragorn,  ‘and  they  are  black  swans.’ \\n\\n‘How  wide  and  empty  and  mournful  all  this  country  looks!’ \\nsaid  Frodo.  ‘I  always  imagined  that  as  one  journeyed  south \\nit  got  warmer  and  merrier,  until  winter  was  left  behind  for \\never.’ \\n\\n‘But  we  have  not  journeyed  far  south  yet,’  answered \\nAragorn.  ‘It  is  still  winter,  and  we  are  far  from  the  sea.  Here \\nthe  world  is  cold  until  the  sudden  spring,  and  we  may  yet \\nhave  snow  again.  Far  away  down  in  the  Bay  of  Belfalas,  to \\nwhich  Anduin  runs,  it  is  warm  and  merry,  maybe,  or  would \\nbe  but  for  the  Enemy.  But  here  we  are  not  above  sixty  leagues, \\nI  guess,  south  of  the  Southfarthing  away  in  your  Shire,  hun¬ \\ndreds  of  long  miles  yonder.  You  are  looking  now  south-west \\nacross  the  north  plains  of  the  Riddermark,  Rohan  the  land  of \\nthe  Horse-lords.  Ere  long  we  shall  come  to  the  mouth  of  the \\nLimlight  that  runs  down  from  Fangorn  to  join  the  Great \\nRiver.  That  is  the  north  boundary  of  Rohan;  and  of  old  all \\nthat  lay  between  Limlight  and  the  White  Mountains  belonged \\n\\n\\nTHE  GREAT  RIVER \\n\\n\\n497 \\n\\n\\nto  the  Rohirrim.  It  is  a  rich  and  pleasant  land,  and  its  grass \\nhas  no  rival;  but  in  these  evil  days  folk  do  not  dwell  by  the \\nRiver  or  ride  often  to  its  shores.  Anduin  is  wide,  yet  the  ores \\ncan  shoot  their  arrows  far  across  the  stream;  and  of  late,  it  is \\nsaid,  they  have  dared  to  cross  the  water  and  raid  the  herds \\nand  studs  of  Rohan.’ \\n\\nSam  looked  from  bank  to  bank  uneasily.  The  trees  had \\nseemed  hostile  before,  as  if  they  harboured  secret  eyes  and \\nlurking  dangers;  now  he  wished  that  the  trees  were  still  there. \\nHe  felt  that  the  Company  was  too  naked,  afloat  in  little  open \\nboats  in  the  midst  of  shelterless  lands,  and  on  a  river  that  was \\nthe  frontier  of  war. \\n\\nIn  the  next  day  or  two,  as  they  went  on,  borne  steadily \\nsouthwards,  this  feeling  of  insecurity  grew  on  all  the  Com¬ \\npany.  For  a  whole  day  they  took  to  their  paddles  and  hastened \\nforward.  The  banks  slid  by.  Soon  the  River  broadened  and \\ngrew  more  shallow;  long  stony  beaches  lay  upon  the  east,  and \\nthere  were  gravel-shoals  in  the  water,  so  that  careful  steering \\nwas  needed.  The  Brown  Lands  rose  into  bleak  wolds,  over \\nwhich  flowed  a  chill  air  from  the  East.  On  the  other  side  the \\nmeads  had  become  rolling  downs  of  withered  grass  amidst  a \\nland  of  fen  and  tussock.  Frodo  shivered,  thinking  of  the  lawns \\nand  fountains,  the  clear  sun  and  gentle  rains  of  Lothlorien. \\nThere  was  little  speech  and  no  laughter  in  any  of  the  boats. \\nEach  member  of  the  Company  was  busy  with  his  own \\nthoughts. \\n\\nThe  heart  of  Legolas  was  running  under  the  stars  of  a \\nsummer  night  in  some  northern  glade  amid  the  beech-woods; \\nGimli  was  fingering  gold  in  his  mind,  and  wondering  if  it \\nwere  fit  to  be  wrought  into  the  housing  of  the  Lady’s  gift. \\nMerry  and  Pippin  in  the  middle  boat  were  ill  at  ease,  for \\nBoromir  sat  muttering  to  himself,  sometimes  biting  his  nails, \\nas  if  some  restlessness  or  doubt  consumed  him,  sometimes \\nseizing  a  paddle  and  driving  the  boat  close  behind  Aragorn’s. \\nThen  Pippin,  who  sat  in  the  bow  looking  back,  caught  a \\nqueer  gleam  in  his  eye,  as  he  peered  forward  gazing  at  Frodo. \\nSam  had  long  ago  made  up  his  mind  that,  though  boats  were \\n\\n\\n498 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nmaybe  not  as  dangerous  as  he  had  been  brought  up  to  believe, \\nthey  were  far  more  uncomfortable  than  even  he  had  imag¬ \\nined.  He  was  cramped  and  miserable,  having  nothing  to  do \\nbut  stare  at  the  winter-lands  crawling  by  and  the  grey  water \\non  either  side  of  him.  Even  when  the  paddles  were  in  use \\nthey  did  not  trust  Sam  with  one. \\n\\nAs  dusk  drew  down  on  the  fourth  day,  he  was  looking \\nback  over  the  bowed  heads  of  Frodo  and  Aragorn  and  the \\nfollowing  boats;  he  was  drowsy  and  longed  for  camp  and  the \\nfeel  of  earth  under  his  toes.  Suddenly  something  caught  his \\nsight:  at  first  he  stared  at  it  listlessly,  then  he  sat  up  and \\nrubbed  his  eyes;  but  when  he  looked  again  he  could  not  see \\nit  any  more. \\n\\nThat  night  they  camped  on  a  small  eyot  close  to  the  western \\nbank.  Sam  lay  rolled  in  blankets  beside  Frodo.  ‘I  had  a  funny \\ndream  an  hour  or  two  before  we  stopped,  Mr.  Frodo,’  he \\nsaid.  ‘Or  maybe  it  wasn’t  a  dream.  Funny  it  was  anyway.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  what  was  it?’  said  Frodo,  knowing  that  Sam  would \\nnot  settle  down  until  he  had  told  his  tale,  whatever  it  was.  ‘I \\nhaven’t  seen  or  thought  of  anything  to  make  me  smile  since \\nwe  left  Lothlorien.’ \\n\\n‘It  wasn’t  funny  that  way,  Mr.  Frodo.  It  was  queer.  All \\nwrong,  if  it  wasn’t  a  dream.  And  you  had  best  hear  it.  It  was \\nlike  this:  I  saw  a  log  with  eyes!’ \\n\\n‘The  log’s  all  right,’  said  Frodo.  ‘There  are  many  in  the \\nRiver.  But  leave  out  the  eyes!’ \\n\\n‘That  I  won’t,’  said  Sam.  \"Twas  the  eyes  as  made  me  sit \\nup,  so  to  speak.  I  saw  what  I  took  to  be  a  log  floating  along \\nin  the  half-light  behind  Gimli’s  boat;  but  I  didn’t  give  much \\nheed  to  it.  Then  it  seemed  as  if  the  log  was  slowly  catching \\nus  up.  And  that  was  peculiar,  as  you  might  say,  seeing  as  we \\nwere  all  floating  on  the  stream  together.  Just  then  I  saw  the \\neyes:  two  pale  sort  of  points,  shiny-like,  on  a  hump  at  the \\nnear  end  of  the  log.  What’s  more,  it  wasn’t  a  log,  for  it  had \\npaddle-feet,  like  a  swan’s  almost,  only  they  seemed  bigger, \\nand  kept  dipping  in  and  out  of  the  water. \\n\\n\\nTHE  GREAT  RIVER \\n\\n\\n499 \\n\\n\\n‘That’s  when  I  sat  right  up  and  rubbed  my  eyes,  meaning \\nto  give  a  shout,  if  it  was  still  there  when  I  had  rubbed  the \\ndrowse  out  of  my  head.  For  the  whatever-it-was  was  coming \\nalong  fast  now  and  getting  close  behind  Gimli.  But  whether \\nthose  two  lamps  spotted  me  moving  and  staring,  or  whether \\nI  came  to  my  senses,  I  don’t  know.  When  I  looked  again,  it \\nwasn’t  there.  Yet  I  think  I  caught  a  glimpse,  with  the  tail  of \\nmy  eye,  as  the  saying  is,  of  something  dark  shooting  under \\nthe  shadow  of  the  bank.  I  couldn’t  see  no  more  eyes,  though. \\n\\n‘I  said  to  myself:  “dreaming  again,  Sam  Gamgee,”  I  said; \\nand  I  said  no  more  just  then.  But  I’ve  been  thinking  since, \\nand  now  I’m  not  so  sure.  What  do  you  make  of  it,  Mr. \\nFrodo?’ \\n\\n‘I  should  make  nothing  of  it  but  a  log  and  the  dusk  and \\nsleep  in  your  eyes,  Sam,’  said  Frodo,  ‘if  this  was  the  first  time \\nthat  those  eyes  had  been  seen.  But  it  isn’t.  I  saw  them  away \\nback  north  before  we  reached  Lorien.  And  I  saw  a  strange \\ncreature  with  eyes  climbing  to  the  flet  that  night.  Haldir  saw \\nit  too.  And  do  you  remember  the  report  of  the  Elves  that \\nwent  after  the  ore-band?’ \\n\\n‘Ah,’  said  Sam,  ‘I  do;  and  I  remember  more  too.  I  don’t \\nlike  my  thoughts;  but  thinking  of  one  thing  and  another,  and \\nMr.  Bilbo’s  stories  and  all,  I  fancy  I  could  put  a  name  on  the \\ncreature,  at  a  guess.  A  nasty  name.  Gollum,  maybe?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,  that  is  what  I  have  feared  for  some  time,’  said  Frodo. \\n‘Ever  since  the  night  on  the  flet.  I  suppose  he  was  lurking  in \\nMoria,  and  picked  up  our  trail  then;  but  I  hoped  that  our \\nstay  in  Lorien  would  throw  him  off  the  scent  again.  The \\nmiserable  creature  must  have  been  hiding  in  the  woods  by \\nthe  Silverlode,  watching  us  start  off!’ \\n\\n‘That’s  about  it,’  said  Sam.  ‘And  we’d  better  be  a  bit  more \\nwatchful  ourselves,  or  we’ll  feel  some  nasty  fingers  round  our \\nnecks  one  of  these  nights,  if  we  ever  wake  up  to  feel  anything. \\nAnd  that’s  what  I  was  leading  up  to.  No  need  to  trouble \\nStrider  or  the  others  tonight.  I’ll  keep  watch.  I  can  sleep \\ntomorrow,  being  no  more  than  luggage  in  a  boat,  as  you \\nmight  say.’ \\n\\n\\n500  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n‘I  might,’  said  Frodo,  ‘and  I  might  say  “luggage  with  eyes”. \\nYou  shall  watch;  but  only  if  you  promise  to  wake  me  half-way \\ntowards  morning,  if  nothing  happens  before  then.’ \\n\\nIn  the  dead  hours  Frodo  came  out  of  a  deep  dark  sleep  to \\nfind  Sam  shaking  him.  ‘It’s  a  shame  to  wake  you,’  whispered \\nSam,  ‘but  that’s  what  you  said.  There’s  nothing  to  tell,  or  not \\nmuch.  I  thought  I  heard  some  soft  plashing  and  a  sniffing \\nnoise,  a  while  back;  but  you  hear  a  lot  of  such  queer  sounds \\nby  a  river  at  night.’ \\n\\nHe  lay  down,  and  Frodo  sat  up,  huddled  in  his  blankets, \\nand  fought  off  his  sleep.  Minutes  or  hours  passed  slowly,  and \\nnothing  happened.  Frodo  was  just  yielding  to  the  temptation \\nto  lie  down  again  when  a  dark  shape,  hardly  visible,  floated \\nclose  to  one  of  the  moored  boats.  A  long  whitish  hand  could \\nbe  dimly  seen  as  it  shot  out  and  grabbed  the  gunwale;  two \\npale  lamplike  eyes  shone  coldly  as  they  peered  inside,  and \\nthen  they  lifted  and  gazed  up  at  Frodo  on  the  eyot.  They \\nwere  not  more  than  a  yard  or  two  away,  and  Frodo  heard  the \\nsoft  hiss  of  intaken  breath.  He  stood  up,  drawing  Sting  from \\nits  sheath,  and  faced  the  eyes.  Immediately  their  light  was \\nshut  off.  There  was  another  hiss  and  a  splash,  and  the  dark \\nlog-shape  shot  away  downstream  into  the  night.  Aragorn \\nstirred  in  his  sleep,  turned  over,  and  sat  up. \\n\\n‘What  is  it?’  he  whispered,  springing  up  and  coming  to \\nFrodo.  ‘I  felt  something  in  my  sleep.  Why  have  you  drawn \\nyour  sword?’ \\n\\n‘Gollum,’  answered  Frodo.  ‘Or  at  least,  so  I  guess.’ \\n\\n‘Ah!’  said  Aragorn.  ‘So  you  know  about  our  little  footpad, \\ndo  you?  He  padded  after  us  all  through  Moria  and  right  down \\nto  Nimrodel.  Since  we  took  to  boats,  he  has  been  lying  on  a \\nlog  and  paddling  with  hands  and  feet.  I  have  tried  to  catch \\nhim  once  or  twice  at  night;  but  he  is  slier  than  a  fox,  and  as \\nslippery  as  a  fish.  I  hoped  the  river-voyage  would  beat  him, \\nbut  he  is  too  clever  a  waterman. \\n\\nWe  shall  have  to  try  going  faster  tomorrow.  You  lie  down \\nnow,  and  I  will  keep  watch  for  what  is  left  of  the  night.  I  wish \\n\\n\\nTHE  GREAT  RIVER \\n\\n\\n501 \\n\\n\\nI  could  lay  my  hands  on  the  wretch.  We  might  make  him \\nuseful.  But  if  I  cannot,  we  shall  have  to  try  and  lose  him.  He \\nis  very  dangerous.  Quite  apart  from  murder  by  night  on  his \\nown  account,  he  may  put  any  enemy  that  is  about  on  our \\ntrack.’ \\n\\nThe  night  passed  without  Gollum  showing  so  much  as  a \\nshadow  again.  After  that  the  Company  kept  a  sharp  look-out, \\nbut  they  saw  no  more  of  Gollum  while  the  voyage  lasted.  If \\nhe  was  still  following,  he  was  very  wary  and  cunning.  At \\nAragorn’s  bidding  they  paddled  now  for  long  spells,  and  the \\nbanks  went  swiftly  by.  But  they  saw  little  of  the  country,  for \\nthey  journeyed  mostly  by  night  and  twilight,  resting  by  day, \\nand  lying  as  hidden  as  the  land  allowed.  In  this  way  the  time \\npassed  without  event  until  the  seventh  day. \\n\\nThe  weather  was  still  grey  and  overcast,  with  wind  from  the \\nEast,  but  as  evening  drew  into  night  the  sky  away  westward \\ncleared,  and  pools  of  faint  light,  yellow  and  pale  green, \\nopened  under  the  grey  shores  of  cloud.  There  the  white  rind \\nof  the  new  Moon  could  be  seen  glimmering  in  the  remote \\nlakes.  Sam  looked  at  it  and  puckered  his  brows. \\n\\nThe  next  day  the  country  on  either  side  began  to  change \\nrapidly.  The  banks  began  to  rise  and  grow  stony.  Soon  they \\nwere  passing  through  a  hilly  rocky  land,  and  on  both  shores \\nthere  were  steep  slopes  buried  in  deep  brakes  of  thorn  and \\nsloe,  tangled  with  brambles  and  creepers.  Behind  them  stood \\nlow  crumbling  cliffs,  and  chimneys  of  grey  weathered  stone \\ndark  with  ivy;  and  beyond  these  again  there  rose  high  ridges \\ncrowned  with  wind-writhen  firs.  They  were  drawing  near  to \\nthe  grey  hill-country  of  the  Emyn  Muil,  the  southern  march \\nof  Wilderland. \\n\\nThere  were  many  birds  about  the  cliffs  and  the  rock- \\nchimneys,  and  all  day  high  in  the  air  flocks  of  birds  had  been \\ncircling,  black  against  the  pale  sky.  As  they  lay  in  their  camp \\nthat  day  Aragorn  watched  the  flights  doubtfully,  wondering \\nif  Gollum  had  been  doing  some  mischief  and  the  news  of \\ntheir  voyage  was  now  moving  in  the  wilderness.  Later  as  the \\n\\n\\n502 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nsun  was  setting,  and  the  Company  was  stirring  and  getting \\nready  to  start  again,  he  descried  a  dark  spot  against  the  fading \\nlight:  a  great  bird  high  and  far  off,  now  wheeling,  now  flying \\non  slowly  southwards. \\n\\n‘What  is  that,  Legolas?’  he  asked,  pointing  to  the  northern \\nsky.  ‘Is  it,  as  I  think,  an  eagle?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  Legolas.  ‘It  is  an  eagle,  a  hunting  eagle.  I  wonder \\nwhat  that  forebodes.  It  is  far  from  the  mountains.’ \\n\\n‘We  will  not  start  until  it  is  fully  dark,’  said  Aragorn. \\n\\nThe  eighth  night  of  their  journey  came.  It  was  silent  and \\nwindless;  the  grey  east  wind  had  passed  away.  The  thin  cres¬ \\ncent  of  the  Moon  had  fallen  early  into  the  pale  sunset,  but \\nthe  sky  was  clear  above,  and  though  far  away  in  the  South \\nthere  were  great  ranges  of  cloud  that  still  shone  faintly,  in  the \\nWest  stars  glinted  bright. \\n\\n‘Come!’  said  Aragorn.  ‘We  will  venture  one  more  journey \\nby  night.  We  are  coming  to  reaches  of  the  River  that  I  do  not \\nknow  well;  for  I  have  never  journeyed  by  water  in  these  parts \\nbefore,  not  between  here  and  the  rapids  of  Sarn  Gebir.  But \\nif  I  am  right  in  my  reckoning,  those  are  still  many  miles \\nahead.  Still  there  are  dangerous  places  even  before  we  come \\nthere:  rocks  and  stony  eyots  in  the  stream.  We  must  keep  a \\nsharp  watch  and  not  try  to  paddle  swiftly.’ \\n\\nTo  Sam  in  the  leading  boat  was  given  the  task  of  watch¬ \\nman.  He  lay  forward  peering  into  the  gloom.  The  night  grew \\ndark,  but  the  stars  above  were  strangely  bright,  and  there  was \\na  glimmer  on  the  face  of  the  River.  It  was  close  on  midnight, \\nand  they  had  been  drifting  for  some  while,  hardly  using  the \\npaddles,  when  suddenly  Sam  cried  out.  Only  a  few  yards \\nahead  dark  shapes  loomed  up  in  the  stream  and  he  heard  the \\nswirl  of  racing  water.  There  was  a  swift  current  which  swung \\nleft,  towards  the  eastern  shore  where  the  channel  was  clear. \\nAs  they  were  swept  aside  the  travellers  could  see,  now  very \\nclose,  the  pale  foam  of  the  River  lashing  against  sharp  rocks \\nthat  were  thrust  out  far  into  the  stream  like  a  ridge  of  teeth. \\nThe  boats  were  all  huddled  together. \\n\\n\\nTHE  GREAT  RIVER \\n\\n\\n503 \\n\\n\\n‘Hoy  there,  Aragorn!’  shouted  Boromir,  as  his  boat \\nbumped  into  the  leader.  ‘This  is  madness!  We  cannot  dare \\nthe  Rapids  by  night!  But  no  boat  can  live  in  Sarn  Gebir,  be \\nit  night  or  day.’ \\n\\n‘Back,  back!’  cried  Aragorn.  ‘Turn!  Turn  if  you  can!’  He \\ndrove  his  paddle  into  the  water,  trying  to  hold  the  boat  and \\nbring  it  round. \\n\\n‘I  am  out  of  my  reckoning,’  he  said  to  Frodo.  ‘I  did  not \\nknow  that  we  had  come  so  far:  Anduin  flows  faster  than  I \\nthought.  Sarn  Gebir  must  be  close  at  hand  already.’ \\n\\nWith  great  efforts  they  checked  the  boats  and  slowly \\nbrought  them  about;  but  at  first  they  could  make  only  small \\nheadway  against  the  current,  and  all  the  time  they  were \\ncarried  nearer  and  nearer  to  the  eastern  bank.  Now  dark  and \\nominous  it  loomed  up  in  the  night. \\n\\n‘All  together,  paddle!’  shouted  Boromir.  ‘Paddle!  Or  we \\nshall  be  driven  on  the  shoals.’  Even  as  he  spoke  Frodo  felt \\nthe  keel  beneath  him  grate  upon  stone. \\n\\nAt  that  moment  there  was  a  twang  of  bowstrings:  several \\narrows  whistled  over  them,  and  some  fell  among  them.  One \\nsmote  Frodo  between  the  shoulders  and  he  lurched  forward \\nwith  a  cry,  letting  go  his  paddle:  but  the  arrow  fell  back, \\nfoiled  by  his  hidden  coat  of  mail.  Another  passed  through \\nAragorn’s  hood;  and  a  third  stood  fast  in  the  gunwale  of  the \\nsecond  boat,  close  by  Merry’s  hand.  Sam  thought  he  could \\nglimpse  black  figures  running  to  and  fro  upon  the  long \\nshingle-banks  that  lay  under  the  eastern  shore.  They  seemed \\nvery  near. \\n\\n‘  Yrch /’  said  Legolas,  falling  into  his  own  tongue. \\n\\n‘Ores!’  cried  Gimli. \\n\\n‘Gollum’s  doing,  I’ll  be  bound,’  said  Sam  to  Frodo.  ‘And \\na  nice  place  to  choose,  too.  The  River  seems  set  on  taking  us \\nright  into  their  arms!’ \\n\\nThey  all  leaned  forward  straining  at  the  paddles:  even  Sam \\ntook  a  hand.  Every  moment  they  expected  to  feel  the  bite  of \\nblack-feathered  arrows.  Many  whined  overhead  or  struck  the \\n\\n\\n504  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nwater  nearby;  but  there  were  no  more  hits.  It  was  dark,  but \\nnot  too  dark  for  the  night-eyes  of  Ores,  and  in  the  star- \\nglimmer  they  must  have  offered  their  cunning  foes  some \\nmark,  unless  it  was  that  the  grey  cloaks  of  Lorien  and  the \\ngrey  timber  of  the  elf-wrought  boats  defeated  the  malice  of \\nthe  archers  of  Mordor. \\n\\nStroke  by  stroke  they  laboured  on.  In  the  darkness  it  was \\nhard  to  be  sure  that  they  were  indeed  moving  at  all;  but  slowly \\nthe  swirl  of  the  water  grew  less,  and  the  shadow  of  the  eastern \\nbank  faded  back  into  the  night.  At  last,  as  far  as  they  could \\njudge,  they  had  reached  the  middle  of  the  stream  again  and \\nhad  driven  their  boats  back  some  distance  above  the  jutting \\nrocks.  Then  half  turning  they  thrust  them  with  all  their \\nstrength  towards  the  western  shore.  Under  the  shadow  of \\nbushes  leaning  out  over  the  water  they  halted  and  drew \\nbreath. \\n\\nLegolas  laid  down  his  paddle  and  took  up  the  bow  that  he \\nhad  brought  from  Lorien.  Then  he  sprang  ashore  and \\nclimbed  a  few  paces  up  the  bank.  Stringing  the  bow  and \\nfitting  an  arrow  he  turned,  peering  back  over  the  River  into \\nthe  darkness.  Across  the  water  there  were  shrill  cries,  but \\nnothing  could  be  seen. \\n\\nFrodo  looked  up  at  the  Elf  standing  tall  above  him,  as  he \\ngazed  into  the  night,  seeking  a  mark  to  shoot  at.  His  head \\nwas  dark,  crowned  with  sharp  white  stars  that  glittered  in  the \\nblack  pools  of  the  sky  behind.  But  now  rising  and  sailing  up \\nfrom  the  South  the  great  clouds  advanced,  sending  out  dark \\noutriders  into  the  starry  fields.  A  sudden  dread  fell  on  the \\nCompany. \\n\\n‘Elbereth  Gilthonieir  sighed  Legolas  as  he  looked  up.  Even \\nas  he  did  so,  a  dark  shape,  like  a  cloud  and  yet  not  a  cloud, \\nfor  it  moved  far  more  swiftly,  came  out  of  the  blackness  in \\nthe  South,  and  sped  towards  the  Company,  blotting  out  all \\nlight  as  it  approached.  Soon  it  appeared  as  a  great  winged \\ncreature,  blacker  than  the  pits  in  the  night.  Fierce  voices  rose \\nup  to  greet  it  from  across  the  water.  Frodo  felt  a  sudden  chill \\nrunning  through  him  and  clutching  at  his  heart;  there  was  a \\n\\n\\nTHE  GREAT  RIVER  505 \\n\\ndeadly  cold,  like  the  memory  of  an  old  wound,  in  his  shoulder. \\nHe  crouched  down,  as  if  to  hide. \\n\\nSuddenly  the  great  bow  of  Lorien  sang.  Shrill  went  the \\narrow  from  the  elven-string.  Frodo  looked  up.  Almost  above \\nhim  the  winged  shape  swerved.  There  was  a  harsh  croaking \\nscream,  as  it  fell  out  of  the  air,  vanishing  down  into  the  gloom \\nof  the  eastern  shore.  The  sky  was  clean  again.  There  was  a \\ntumult  of  many  voices  far  away,  cursing  and  wailing  in  the \\ndarkness,  and  then  silence.  Neither  shaft  nor  cry  came  again \\nfrom  the  east  that  night. \\n\\nAfter  a  while  Aragorn  led  the  boats  back  upstream.  They \\nfelt  their  way  along  the  water’s  edge  for  some  distance,  until \\nthey  found  a  small  shallow  bay.  A  few  low  trees  grew  there \\nclose  to  the  water,  and  behind  them  rose  a  steep  rocky  hank. \\nHere  the  Company  decided  to  stay  and  await  the  dawn:  it \\nwas  useless  to  attempt  to  move  further  by  night.  They  made \\nno  camp  and  lit  no  fire,  but  lay  huddled  in  the  boats,  moored \\nclose  together. \\n\\n‘Praised  be  the  bow  of  Galadriel,  and  the  hand  and  eye  of \\nLegolas!’  said  Gimli,  as  he  munched  a  wafer  of  lembas.  ‘That \\nwas  a  mighty  shot  in  the  dark,  my  friend!’ \\n\\n‘But  who  can  say  what  it  hit?’  said  Legolas. \\n\\n‘I  cannot,’  said  Gimli.  ‘But  I  am  glad  that  the  shadow  came \\nno  nearer.  I  liked  it  not  at  all.  Too  much  it  reminded  me  of \\nthe  shadow  in  Moria  -  the  shadow  of  the  Balrog,’  he  ended \\nin  a  whisper. \\n\\n‘It  was  not  a  Balrog,’  said  Frodo,  still  shivering  with  the \\nchill  that  had  come  upon  him.  ‘It  was  something  colder.  I \\nthink  it  was - ’  Then  he  paused  and  fell  silent. \\n\\n‘What  do  you  think?’  asked  Boromir  eagerly,  leaning  from \\nhis  boat,  as  if  he  was  trying  to  catch  a  glimpse  of  Frodo’s  face. \\n\\n‘I  think — No,  I  will  not  say,’  answered  Frodo.  ‘Whatever \\nit  was,  its  fall  has  dismayed  our  enemies.’ \\n\\n‘So  it  seems,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘Yet  where  they  are,  and  how \\nmany,  and  what  they  will  do  next,  we  do  not  know.  This \\nnight  we  must  all  be  sleepless!  Dark  hides  us  now.  But  what \\n\\n\\n506  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nthe  day  will  show  who  can  tell?  Have  your  weapons  close  to \\nhand!’ \\n\\nSam  sat  tapping  the  hilt  of  his  sword  as  if  he  were  counting \\non  his  fingers,  and  looking  up  at  the  sky.  ‘It’s  very  strange,’ \\nhe  murmured.  ‘The  Moon’s  the  same  in  the  Shire  and  in \\nWilderland,  or  it  ought  to  be.  But  either  it’s  out  of  its  running, \\nor  I’m  all  wrong  in  my  reckoning.  You’ll  remember,  Mr. \\nFrodo,  the  Moon  was  waning  as  we  lay  on  the  flet  up  in  that \\ntree:  a  week  from  the  full,  I  reckon.  And  we’d  been  a  week \\non  the  way  last  night,  when  up  pops  a  New  Moon  as  thin  as \\na  nail-paring,  as  if  we  had  never  stayed  no  time  in  the  Elvish \\ncountry. \\n\\n‘Well,  I  can  remember  three  nights  there  for  certain,  and  I \\nseem  to  remember  several  more,  but  I  would  take  my  oath  it \\nwas  never  a  whole  month.  Anyone  would  think  that  time  did \\nnot  count  in  there!’ \\n\\n‘And  perhaps  that  was  the  way  of  it,’  said  Frodo.  ‘In  that \\nland,  maybe,  we  were  in  a  time  that  has  elsewhere  long  gone \\nby.  It  was  not,  I  think,  until  Silverlode  bore  us  back  to  Anduin \\nthat  we  returned  to  the  time  that  flows  through  mortal  lands \\nto  the  Great  Sea.  And  I  don’t  remember  any  moon,  either \\nnew  or  old,  in  Caras  Galadhon:  only  stars  by  night  and  sun \\nby  day.’ \\n\\nLegolas  stirred  in  his  boat.  ‘Nay,  time  does  not  tarry  ever,’ \\nhe  said;  ‘but  change  and  growth  is  not  in  all  things  and  places \\nalike.  For  the  Elves  the  world  moves,  and  it  moves  both  very \\nswift  and  very  slow.  Swift,  because  they  themselves  change \\nlittle,  and  all  else  fleets  by:  it  is  a  grief  to  them.  Slow,  because \\nthey  need  not  count  the  running  years,  not  for  themselves. \\nThe  passing  seasons  are  but  ripples  ever  repeated  in  the  long \\nlong  stream.  Yet  beneath  the  Sun  all  things  must  wear  to  an \\nend  at  last.’ \\n\\n‘But  the  wearing  is  slow  in  Lorien,’  said  Frodo.  ‘The  power \\nof  the  Lady  is  on  it.  Rich  are  the  hours,  though  short  they \\nseem,  in  Caras  Galadhon,  where  Galadriel  wields  the  Elven- \\nring.’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  GREAT  RIVER \\n\\n\\n507 \\n\\n\\n‘That  should  not  have  been  said  outside  Lorien,  not  even \\nto  me,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘Speak  no  more  of  it!  But  so  it  is,  Sam: \\nin  that  land  you  lost  your  count.  There  time  flowed  swiftly \\nby  us,  as  for  the  Elves.  The  old  moon  passed,  and  a  new \\nmoon  waxed  and  waned  in  the  world  outside,  while  we  tarried \\nthere.  And  yestereve  a  new  moon  came  again.  Winter  is \\nnearly  gone.  Time  flows  on  to  a  spring  of  little  hope.’ \\n\\nThe  night  passed  silently.  No  voice  or  call  was  heard  again \\nacross  the  water.  The  travellers  huddled  in  their  boats  felt  the \\nchanging  of  the  weather.  The  air  grew  warm  and  very  still \\nunder  the  great  moist  clouds  that  had  floated  up  from  the \\nSouth  and  the  distant  seas.  The  rushing  of  the  River  over \\nthe  rocks  of  the  rapids  seemed  to  grow  louder  and  closer. \\nThe  twigs  of  the  trees  above  them  began  to  drip. \\n\\nWhen  the  day  came  the  mood  of  the  world  about  them  had \\nbecome  soft  and  sad.  Slowly  the  dawn  grew  to  a  pale  light, \\ndiffused  and  shadowless.  There  was  mist  on  the  River,  and \\nwhite  fog  swathed  the  shore;  the  far  hank  could  not  be  seen. \\n\\n‘I  can’t  abide  fog,’  said  Sam;  ‘but  this  seems  to  be  a  lucky \\none.  Now  perhaps  we  can  get  away  without  those  cursed \\ngoblins  seeing  us.’ \\n\\n‘Perhaps  so,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘But  it  will  be  hard  to  find  the \\npath  unless  the  fog  lifts  a  little  later  on.  And  we  must  find  the \\npath,  if  we  are  to  pass  Sarn  Gebir  and  come  to  the  Emyn \\nMuil.’ \\n\\n‘I  do  not  see  why  we  should  pass  the  Rapids  or  follow  the \\nRiver  any  further,’  said  Boromir.  ‘If  the  Emyn  Muil  lie  before \\nus,  then  we  can  abandon  these  cockle-boats,  and  strike  west¬ \\nward  and  southward,  until  we  come  to  the  Entwash  and  cross \\ninto  my  own  land.’ \\n\\nWe  can,  if  we  are  malting  for  Minas  Tirith,’  said  Aragorn, \\n‘but  that  is  not  yet  agreed.  And  such  a  course  may  be  more \\nperilous  than  it  sounds.  The  vale  of  Entwash  is  flat  and  fenny, \\nand  fog  is  a  deadly  peril  there  for  those  on  foot  and  laden.  I \\nwould  not  abandon  our  boats  until  we  must.  The  River  is  at \\nleast  a  path  that  cannot  be  missed.’ \\n\\n\\n508  the  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\n‘But  the  Enemy  holds  the  eastern  bank,’  objected  Boromir. \\n‘And  even  if  you  pass  the  Gates  of  Argonath  and  come \\nunmolested  to  the  Tindrock,  what  will  you  do  then?  Leap \\ndown  the  Falls  and  land  in  the  marshes?’ \\n\\n‘No!’  answered  Aragorn.  ‘Say  rather  that  we  will  bear  our \\nboats  by  the  ancient  way  to  Rauros-foot,  and  there  take  to \\nthe  water  again.  Do  you  not  know,  Boromir,  or  do  you  choose \\nto  forget  the  North  Stair,  and  the  high  seat  upon  Amon  Hen, \\nthat  were  made  in  the  days  of  the  great  kings?  I  at  least  have \\na  mind  to  stand  in  that  high  place  again,  before  I  decide  my \\nfurther  course.  There,  maybe,  we  shall  see  some  sign  that \\nwill  guide  us.’ \\n\\nBoromir  held  out  long  against  this  choice;  but  when  it \\nbecame  plain  that  Frodo  would  follow  Aragorn,  wherever  he \\nwent,  he  gave  in.  ‘It  is  not  the  way  of  the  Men  of  Minas \\nTirith  to  desert  their  friends  at  need,’  he  said,  ‘and  you  will \\nneed  my  strength,  if  ever  you  are  to  reach  the  Tindrock.  To \\nthe  tall  isle  I  will  go,  but  no  further.  There  I  shall  turn  to  my \\nhome,  alone  if  my  help  has  not  earned  the  reward  of  any \\ncompanionship.’ \\n\\nThe  day  was  now  growing,  and  the  fog  had  lifted  a  little. \\nIt  was  decided  that  Aragorn  and  Legolas  should  at  once  go \\nforward  along  the  shore,  while  the  others  remained  by  the \\nboats.  Aragorn  hoped  to  find  some  way  by  which  they  could \\ncarry  both  their  boats  and  their  baggage  to  the  smoother \\nwater  beyond  the  Rapids. \\n\\n‘Boats  of  the  Elves  would  not  sink,  maybe,’  he  said,  ‘but \\nthat  does  not  say  that  we  should  come  through  Sarn  Gebir \\nalive.  None  have  ever  done  so  yet.  No  road  was  made  by  the \\nMen  of  Gondor  in  this  region,  for  even  in  their  great  days \\ntheir  realm  did  not  reach  up  Anduin  beyond  the  Emyn  Muil; \\nbut  there  is  a  portage-way  somewhere  on  the  western  shore, \\nif  I  can  find  it.  It  cannot  yet  have  perished;  for  light  boats \\nused  to  journey  out  of  Wilderland  down  to  Osgiliath,  and  still \\ndid  so  until  a  few  years  ago,  when  the  Ores  of  Mordor  began \\nto  multiply.’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  GREAT  RIVER \\n\\n\\n509 \\n\\n\\n‘Seldom  in  my  life  has  any  boat  come  out  of  the  North,  and \\nthe  Ores  prowl  on  the  east-shore,’  said  Boromir.  ‘If  you  go  for¬ \\nward,  peril  will  grow  with  every  mile,  even  if  you  find  a  path.’ \\n\\n‘Peril  lies  ahead  on  every  southward  road,’  answered \\nAragorn.  ‘Wait  for  us  one  day.  If  we  do  not  return  in  that \\ntime,  you  will  know  that  evil  has  indeed  befallen  us.  Then \\nyou  must  take  a  new  leader  and  follow  him  as  best  you  can.’ \\n\\nIt  was  with  a  heavy  heart  that  Frodo  saw  Aragorn  and \\nLegolas  climb  the  steep  hank  and  vanish  into  the  mists;  but \\nhis  fears  proved  groundless.  Only  two  or  three  hours  had \\npassed,  and  it  was  barely  mid-day,  when  the  shadowy  shapes \\nof  the  explorers  appeared  again. \\n\\n‘All  is  well,’  said  Aragorn,  as  he  clambered  down  the  hank. \\n‘There  is  a  track,  and  it  leads  to  a  good  landing  that  is  still \\nserviceable.  The  distance  is  not  great:  the  head  of  the  Rapids \\nis  but  half  a  mile  below  us,  and  they  are  little  more  than  a \\nmile  long.  Not  far  beyond  them  the  stream  becomes  clear \\nand  smooth  again,  though  it  runs  swiftly.  Our  hardest  task \\nwill  be  to  get  our  boats  and  baggage  to  the  old  portage-way. \\nWe  have  found  it,  but  it  lies  well  back  from  the  water-side \\nhere,  and  runs  under  the  lee  of  a  rock-wall,  a  furlong  or  more \\nfrom  the  shore.  We  did  not  find  where  the  northward  landing \\nlies.  If  it  still  remains,  we  must  have  passed  it  yesterday  night. \\nWe  might  labour  far  upstream  and  yet  miss  it  in  the  fog.  I \\nfear  we  must  leave  the  River  now,  and  make  for  the  portage¬ \\nway  as  best  we  can  from  here.’ \\n\\n‘That  would  not  be  easy,  even  if  we  were  all  Men,’  said \\nBoromir. \\n\\n‘Yet  such  as  we  are  we  will  try  it,’  said  Aragorn. \\n\\n‘Aye,  we  will,’  said  Gimli.  ‘The  legs  of  Men  will  lag  on  a \\nrough  road,  while  a  Dwarf  goes  on,  be  the  burden  twice  his \\nown  weight,  Master  Boromir!’ \\n\\nThe  task  proved  hard  indeed,  yet  in  the  end  it  was  done. \\nThe  goods  were  taken  out  of  the  boats  and  brought  to  the \\ntop  of  the  bank,  where  there  was  a  level  space.  Then  the \\nboats  were  drawn  out  of  the  water  and  carried  up.  They  were \\n\\n\\n510  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nfar  less  heavy  than  any  had  expected.  Of  what  tree  growing \\nin  the  Elvish  country  they  were  made  not  even  Legolas  knew; \\nbut  the  wood  was  tough  and  yet  strangely  light.  Merry  and \\nPippin  alone  could  carry  their  boat  with  ease  along  the  flat. \\nNonetheless  it  needed  the  strength  of  the  two  Men  to  lift  and \\nhaul  them  over  the  ground  that  the  Company  now  had  to \\ncross.  It  sloped  up  away  from  the  River,  a  tumbled  waste  of \\ngrey  limestone-boulders,  with  many  hidden  holes  shrouded \\nwith  weeds  and  bushes;  there  were  thickets  of  brambles,  and \\nsheer  dells;  and  here  and  there  boggy  pools  fed  by  waters \\ntrickling  from  the  terraces  further  inland. \\n\\nOne  by  one  Boromir  and  Aragorn  carried  the  boats,  while \\nthe  others  toiled  and  scrambled  after  them  with  the  baggage. \\nAt  last  all  was  removed  and  laid  on  the  portage-way.  Then \\nwith  little  further  hindrance,  save  from  sprawling  briars  and \\nmany  fallen  stones,  they  moved  forward  all  together.  Fog  still \\nhung  in  veils  upon  the  crumbling  rock-wall,  and  to  their \\nleft  mist  shrouded  the  River:  they  could  hear  it  rushing  and \\nfoaming  over  the  sharp  shelves  and  stony  teeth  of  Sarn  Gebir, \\nbut  they  could  not  see  it.  Twice  they  made  the  journey,  before \\nall  was  brought  safe  to  the  southern  landing. \\n\\nThere  the  portage-way,  turning  back  to  the  water-side,  ran \\ngently  down  to  the  shallow  edge  of  a  little  pool.  It  seemed  to \\nhave  been  scooped  in  the  river-side,  not  by  hand,  but  by  the \\nwater  swirling  down  from  Sarn  Gebir  against  a  low  pier  of \\nrock  that  jutted  out  some  way  into  the  stream.  Beyond  it  the \\nshore  rose  sheer  into  a  grey  cliff,  and  there  was  no  further \\npassage  for  those  on  foot. \\n\\nAlready  the  short  afternoon  was  past,  and  a  dim  cloudy \\ndusk  was  closing  in.  They  sat  beside  the  water  listening  to \\nthe  confused  rush  and  roar  of  the  Rapids  hidden  in  the  mist; \\nthey  were  tired  and  sleepy,  and  their  hearts  were  as  gloomy \\nas  the  dying  day. \\n\\n‘Well,  here  we  are,  and  here  we  must  pass  another  night,’ \\nsaid  Boromir.  ‘We  need  sleep,  and  even  if  Aragorn  had  a \\nmind  to  pass  the  Gates  of  Argonath  by  night,  we  are  all  too \\ntired  -  except,  no  doubt,  our  sturdy  dwarf.’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  GREAT  RIVER \\n\\n\\n511 \\n\\n\\nGimli  made  no  reply:  he  was  nodding  as  he  sat. \\n\\n‘Let  us  rest  as  much  as  we  can  now,’  said  Aragorn. \\n‘Tomorrow  we  must  journey  by  day  again.  Unless  the \\nweather  changes  once  more  and  cheats  us,  we  shall  have  a \\ngood  chance  of  slipping  through,  unseen  by  any  eyes  on  the \\neastern  shore.  But  tonight  two  must  watch  together  in  turns: \\nthree  hours  off  and  one  on  guard.’ \\n\\nNothing  happened  that  night  worse  than  a  brief  drizzle  of \\nrain  an  hour  before  dawn.  As  soon  as  it  was  fully  light  they \\nstarted.  Already  the  fog  was  thinning.  They  kept  as  close  as \\nthey  could  to  the  western  side,  and  they  could  see  the  dim \\nshapes  of  the  low  cliffs  rising  ever  higher,  shadowy  walls  with \\ntheir  feet  in  the  hurrying  river.  In  the  mid-morning  the  clouds \\ndrew  down  lower,  and  it  began  to  rain  heavily.  They  drew \\nthe  skin-covers  over  their  boats  to  prevent  them  from  being \\nflooded,  and  drifted  on;  little  could  be  seen  before  them  or \\nabout  them  through  the  grey  falling  curtains. \\n\\nThe  rain,  however,  did  not  last  long.  Slowly  the  sky  above \\ngrew  lighter,  and  then  suddenly  the  clouds  broke,  and  their \\ndraggled  fringes  trailed  away  northward  up  the  River.  The \\nfogs  and  mists  were  gone.  Before  the  travellers  lay  a  wide \\nravine,  with  great  rocky  sides  to  which  clung,  upon  shelves \\nand  in  narrow  crevices,  a  few  thrawn  trees.  The  channel  grew \\nnarrower  and  the  River  swifter.  Now  they  were  speeding \\nalong  with  little  hope  of  stopping  or  turning,  whatever  they \\nmight  meet  ahead.  Over  them  was  a  lane  of  pale-blue  sky, \\naround  them  the  dark  overshadowed  River,  and  before  them \\nblack,  shutting  out  the  sun,  the  hills  of  Emyn  Muil,  in  which \\nno  opening  could  be  seen. \\n\\nFrodo  peering  forward  saw  in  the  distance  two  great  rocks \\napproaching:  like  great  pinnacles  or  pillars  of  stone  they \\nseemed.  Tall  and  sheer  and  ominous  they  stood  upon  either \\nside  of  the  stream.  A  narrow  gap  appeared  between  them, \\nand  the  River  swept  the  boats  towards  it. \\n\\n‘Behold  the  Argonath,  the  Pillars  of  the  Kings!’  cried \\nAragorn.  ‘We  shall  pass  them  soon.  Keep  the  boats  in  line, \\n\\n\\n512  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nand  as  far  apart  as  you  can!  Hold  the  middle  of  the  stream!’ \\n\\nAs  Frodo  was  borne  towards  them  the  great  pillars  rose \\nlike  towers  to  meet  him.  Giants  they  seemed  to  him,  vast  grey \\nfigures  silent  but  threatening.  Then  he  saw  that  they  were \\nindeed  shaped  and  fashioned:  the  craft  and  power  of  old  had \\nwrought  upon  them,  and  still  they  preserved  through  the  suns \\nand  rains  of  forgotten  years  the  mighty  likenesses  in  which \\nthey  had  been  hewn.  Upon  great  pedestals  founded  in  the \\ndeep  waters  stood  two  great  kings  of  stone:  still  with  blurred \\neyes  and  crannied  brows  they  frowned  upon  the  North.  The \\nleft  hand  of  each  was  raised  palm  outwards  in  gesture  of \\nwarning;  in  each  right  hand  there  was  an  axe;  upon  each  head \\nthere  was  a  crumbling  helm  and  crown.  Great  power  and \\nmajesty  they  still  wore,  the  silent  wardens  of  a  long-vanished \\nkingdom.  Awe  and  fear  fell  upon  Frodo,  and  he  cowered \\ndown,  shutting  his  eyes  and  not  daring  to  look  up  as  the  boat \\ndrew  near.  Even  Boromir  bowed  his  head  as  the  boats  whirled \\nby,  frail  and  fleeting  as  little  leaves,  under  the  enduring \\nshadow  of  the  sentinels  of  Numenor.  So  they  passed  into  the \\ndark  chasm  of  the  Gates. \\n\\nSheer  rose  the  dreadful  cliffs  to  unguessed  heights  on  either \\nside.  Far  off  was  the  dim  sky.  The  black  waters  roared  and \\nechoed,  and  a  wind  screamed  over  them.  Frodo  crouching \\nover  his  knees  heard  Sam  in  front  muttering  and  groaning: \\n‘What  a  place!  What  a  horrible  place!  Just  let  me  get  out  of \\nthis  boat,  and  I’ll  never  wet  my  toes  in  a  puddle  again,  let \\nalone  a  river!’ \\n\\n‘Fear  not!’  said  a  strange  voice  behind  him.  Frodo  turned \\nand  saw  Strider,  and  yet  not  Strider;  for  the  weatherworn \\nRanger  was  no  longer  there.  In  the  stern  sat  Aragorn  son  of \\nArathorn,  proud  and  erect,  guiding  the  boat  with  skilful \\nstrokes;  his  hood  was  cast  back,  and  his  dark  hair  was  blowing \\nin  the  wind,  a  light  was  in  his  eyes:  a  king  returning  from \\nexile  to  his  own  land. \\n\\n‘Fear  not!’  he  said.  ‘Long  have  I  desired  to  look  upon  the \\nlikenesses  of  Isildur  and  Anarion,  my  sires  of  old.  Under  their \\nshadow  Elessar,  the  Elfstone  son  of  Arathorn  of  the  House \\n\\n\\nTHE  GREAT  RIVER \\n\\n\\n513 \\n\\n\\nof  Valandil  Isildur’s  son,  heir  of  Elendil,  has  naught  to  dread!’ \\n\\nThen  the  light  of  his  eyes  faded,  and  he  spoke  to  himself: \\n‘Would  that  Gandalf  were  here!  How  my  heart  yearns  for \\nMinas  Anor  and  the  walls  of  my  own  city!  But  whither  now \\nshah  I  go?’ \\n\\nThe  chasm  was  long  and  dark,  and  filled  with  the  noise  of \\nwind  and  rushing  water  and  echoing  stone.  It  bent  somewhat \\ntowards  the  west  so  that  at  first  all  was  dark  ahead;  but  soon \\nFrodo  saw  a  tall  gap  of  light  before  him,  ever  growing.  Swiftly \\nit  drew  near,  and  suddenly  the  boats  shot  through,  out  into \\na  wide  clear  light. \\n\\nThe  sun,  already  long  fallen  from  the  noon,  was  shining  in \\na  windy  sky.  The  pent  waters  spread  out  into  a  long  oval \\nlake,  pale  Nen  Hithoel,  fenced  by  steep  grey  hills  whose  sides \\nwere  clad  with  trees,  but  their  heads  were  bare,  cold-gleaming \\nin  the  sunlight.  At  the  far  southern  end  rose  three  peaks. \\nThe  midmost  stood  somewhat  forward  from  the  others  and \\nsundered  from  them,  an  island  in  the  waters,  about  which \\nthe  flowing  River  flung  pale  shimmering  arms.  Distant  but \\ndeep  there  came  up  on  the  wind  a  roaring  sound  like  the  roll \\nof  thunder  heard  far  away. \\n\\n‘Behold  Tol  Brandir!’  said  Aragorn,  pointing  south  to  the \\ntall  peak.  ‘Upon  the  left  stands  Amon  Lhaw,  and  upon  the \\nright  is  Amon  Hen,  the  Hills  of  Hearing  and  of  Sight.  In \\nthe  days  of  the  great  kings  there  were  high  seats  upon  them, \\nand  watch  was  kept  there.  But  it  is  said  that  no  foot  of  man \\nor  beast  has  ever  been  set  upon  Tol  Brandir.  Ere  the  shade \\nof  night  falls  we  shall  come  to  them.  I  hear  the  endless  voice \\nof  Rauros  calling.’ \\n\\nThe  Company  rested  now  for  a  while,  drifting  south  on \\nthe  current  that  flowed  through  the  middle  of  the  lake.  They \\nate  some  food,  and  then  they  took  to  their  paddles  and \\nhastened  on  their  way.  The  sides  of  the  westward  hills  fell \\ninto  shadow,  and  the  Sun  grew  round  and  red.  Here  and \\nthere  a  misty  star  peered  out.  The  three  peaks  loomed  before \\nthem,  darkling  in  the  twilight.  Rauros  was  roaring  with  a  great \\n\\n\\n514  THE  fellowship  of  the  ring \\n\\nvoice.  Already  night  was  laid  on  the  flowing  waters  when  the \\ntravellers  came  at  last  under  the  shadow  of  the  hills. \\n\\nThe  tenth  day  of  their  journey  was  over.  Wilderland  was \\nbehind  them.  They  could  go  no  further  without  choice \\nbetween  the  east-way  and  the  west.  The  last  stage  of  the \\nQuest  was  before  them. \\n\\n\\nChapter  io \\n\\n\\nTHE  BREAKING  OF  THE  FELLOWSHIP \\n\\n\\nAragorn  led  them  to  the  right  arm  of  the  River.  Here  upon \\nits  western  side  under  the  shadow  of  Tol  Brandir  a  green \\nlawn  ran  down  to  the  water  from  the  feet  of  Amon  Hen. \\nBehind  it  rose  the  first  gentle  slopes  of  the  hill  clad  with  trees, \\nand  trees  marched  away  westward  along  the  curving  shores \\nof  the  lake.  A  little  spring  fell  tumbling  down  and  fed  the \\ngrass. \\n\\n‘Here  we  will  rest  tonight,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘This  is  the  lawn \\nof  Parth  Galen:  a  fair  place  in  the  summer  days  of  old.  Let \\nus  hope  that  no  evil  has  yet  come  here.’ \\n\\nThey  drew  up  their  boats  on  the  green  banks,  and  beside \\nthem  they  made  their  camp.  They  set  a  watch,  but  had  no \\nsight  nor  sound  of  their  enemies.  If  Gollum  had  conttived  to \\nfollow  them,  he  remained  unseen  and  unheard.  Nonetheless \\nas  the  night  wore  on  Aragorn  grew  uneasy,  tossing  often  in \\nhis  sleep  and  waking.  In  the  small  hours  he  got  up  and  came \\nto  Frodo,  whose  turn  it  was  to  watch. \\n\\n‘Why  are  you  waking?’  asked  Frodo.  ‘It  is  not  your  watch.’ \\n\\n‘I  do  not  know,’  answered  Aragorn;  ‘but  a  shadow  and  a \\nthreat  has  been  growing  in  my  sleep.  It  would  be  well  to  draw \\nyour  sword.’ \\n\\n‘Why?’  said  Frodo.  ‘Are  enemies  at  hand?’ \\n\\n‘Let  us  see  what  Sting  may  show,’  answered  Aragorn. \\n\\nFrodo  then  drew  the  elf-blade  from  its  sheath.  To  his  dis¬ \\nmay  the  edges  gleamed  dimly  in  the  night.  ‘Ores!’  he  said. \\n‘Not  very  near,  and  yet  too  near,  it  seems.’ \\n\\n‘I  feared  as  much,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘But  maybe  they  are  not \\non  this  side  of  the  River.  The  light  of  Sting  is  faint,  and  it \\nmay  point  to  no  more  than  spies  of  Mordor  roaming  on  the \\nslopes  of  Amon  Lhaw.  I  have  never  heard  before  of  Ores \\n\\n\\n5i6 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nupon  Amon  Hen.  Yet  who  knows  what  may  happen  in  these \\nevil  days,  now  that  Minas  Tirith  no  longer  holds  secure  the \\npassages  of  Anduin.  We  must  go  warily  tomorrow.’ \\n\\nThe  day  came  like  fire  and  smoke.  Low  in  the  East  there \\nwere  black  bars  of  cloud  like  the  fumes  of  a  great  burning. \\nThe  rising  sun  lit  them  from  beneath  with  flames  of  murky \\nred;  but  soon  it  climbed  above  them  into  a  clear  sky.  The \\nsummit  of  Tol  Brandir  was  tipped  with  gold.  Frodo  looked \\nout  eastward  and  gazed  at  the  tall  island.  Its  sides  sprang \\nsheer  out  of  the  running  water.  High  up  above  the  tall  cliffs \\nwere  steep  slopes  upon  which  trees  climbed,  mounting  one \\nhead  above  another;  and  above  them  again  were  grey  faces \\nof  inaccessible  rock,  crowned  by  a  great  spire  of  stone.  Many \\nbirds  were  circling  about  it,  but  no  sign  of  other  living  things \\ncould  be  seen. \\n\\nWhen  they  had  eaten,  Aragorn  called  the  Company \\ntogether.  ‘The  day  has  come  at  last,’  he  said:  ‘the  day  of \\nchoice  which  we  have  long  delayed.  What  shall  now  become \\nof  our  Company  that  has  travelled  so  far  in  fellowship?  Shall \\nwe  turn  west  with  Boromir  and  go  to  the  wars  of  Gondor;  or \\nturn  east  to  the  Fear  and  Shadow;  or  shall  we  break  our \\nfellowship  and  go  this  way  and  that  as  each  may  choose? \\nWhatever  we  do  must  be  done  soon.  We  cannot  long  halt \\nhere.  The  enemy  is  on  the  eastern  shore,  we  know;  but  I  fear \\nthat  the  Ores  may  already  be  on  this  side  of  the  water.’ \\n\\nThere  was  a  long  silence  in  which  no  one  spoke  or  moved. \\n\\nWell,  Frodo,’  said  Aragorn  at  last.  ‘I  fear  that  the  burden \\nis  laid  upon  you.  You  are  the  Bearer  appointed  by  the  Coun¬ \\ncil.  Your  own  way  you  alone  can  choose.  In  this  matter  I \\ncannot  advise  you.  I  am  not  Gandalf,  and  though  I  have  tried \\nto  bear  his  part,  I  do  not  know  what  design  or  hope  he  had \\nfor  this  hour,  if  indeed  he  had  any.  Most  likely  it  seems  that \\nif  he  were  here  now  the  choice  would  still  wait  on  you.  Such \\nis  your  fate.’ \\n\\nFrodo  did  not  answer  at  once.  Then  he  spoke  slowly.  ‘I \\nknow  that  haste  is  needed,  yet  I  cannot  choose.  The  burden \\n\\n\\nTHE  BREAKING  OF  THE  FELLOWSHIP  517 \\n\\nis  heavy.  Give  me  an  hour  longer,  and  I  will  speak.  Let  me \\nbe  alone!’ \\n\\nAragorn  looked  at  him  with  kindly  pity.  ‘Very  well,  Frodo \\nson  of  Drogo,’  he  said.  ‘You  shall  have  an  hour,  and  you \\nshall  be  alone.  We  will  stay  here  for  a  while.  But  do  not  stray \\nfar  or  out  of  call.’ \\n\\nFrodo  sat  for  a  moment  with  his  head  bowed.  Sam,  who \\nhad  been  watching  his  master  with  great  concern,  shook  his \\nhead  and  muttered:  ‘Plain  as  a  pikestaff  it  is,  but  it’s  no  good \\nSam  Gamgee  putting  in  his  spoke  just  now.’ \\n\\nPresently  Frodo  got  up  and  walked  away;  and  Sam  saw \\nthat  while  the  others  restrained  themselves  and  did  not  stare \\nat  him,  the  eyes  of  Boromir  followed  Frodo  intently,  until  he \\npassed  out  of  sight  in  the  trees  at  the  foot  of  Amon  Hen. \\n\\nWandering  aimlessly  at  first  in  the  wood,  Frodo  found  that \\nhis  feet  were  leading  him  up  towards  the  slopes  of  the  hill. \\nHe  came  to  a  path,  the  dwindling  ruins  of  a  road  of  long  ago. \\nIn  steep  places  stairs  of  stone  had  been  hewn,  but  now  they \\nwere  cracked  and  worn,  and  split  by  the  roots  of  trees.  For \\nsome  while  he  climbed,  not  caring  which  way  he  went,  until \\nhe  came  to  a  grassy  place.  Rowan-trees  grew  about  it,  and  in \\nthe  midst  was  a  wide  flat  stone.  The  little  upland  lawn  was \\nopen  upon  the  East  and  was  filled  now  with  the  early  sunlight. \\nFrodo  halted  and  looked  out  over  the  River,  far  below  him, \\nto  Tol  Brandir  and  the  birds  wheeling  in  the  great  gulf  of  air \\nbetween  him  and  the  untrodden  isle.  The  voice  of  Rauros \\nwas  a  mighty  roaring  mingled  with  a  deep  throbbing  boom. \\n\\nHe  sat  down  upon  the  stone  and  cupped  his  chin  in  his \\nhands,  staring  eastwards  but  seeing  little  with  his  eyes.  All \\nthat  had  happened  since  Bilbo  left  the  Shire  was  passing \\nthrough  his  mind,  and  he  recalled  and  pondered  everything \\nthat  he  could  remember  of  Gandalf ’s  words.  Time  went  on, \\nand  still  he  was  no  nearer  to  a  choice. \\n\\nSuddenly  he  awoke  from  his  thoughts:  a  strange  feeling \\ncame  to  him  that  something  was  behind  him,  that  unfriendly \\neyes  were  upon  him.  He  sprang  up  and  turned;  but  all  that \\n\\n\\n5 1 8 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nhe  saw  to  his  surprise  was  Boromir,  and  his  face  was  smiling \\nand  kind. \\n\\n‘I  was  afraid  for  you,  Frodo,’  he  said,  coming  forward.  ‘If \\nAragorn  is  right  and  Ores  are  near,  then  none  of  us  should \\nwander  alone,  and  you  least  of  all:  so  much  depends  on  you. \\nAnd  my  heart  too  is  heavy.  May  I  stay  now  and  talk  for  a \\nwhile,  since  I  have  found  you?  It  would  comfort  me.  Where \\nthere  are  so  many,  all  speech  becomes  a  debate  without  end. \\nBut  two  together  may  perhaps  find  wisdom.’ \\n\\n‘You  are  kind,’  answered  Frodo.  ‘But  I  do  not  think  that \\nany  speech  will  help  me.  For  I  know  what  I  should  do,  but  I \\nam  afraid  of  doing  it,  Boromir:  afraid.’ \\n\\nBoromir  stood  silent.  Rauros  roared  endlessly  on.  The \\nwind  murmured  in  the  branches  of  the  trees.  Frodo  shivered. \\n\\nSuddenly  Boromir  came  and  sat  beside  him.  ‘Are  you  sure \\nthat  you  do  not  suffer  needlessly?’  he  said.  ‘I  wish  to  help  you. \\nY ou  need  counsel  in  your  hard  choice.  Will  you  not  take  mine?’ \\n\\n‘I  think  I  know  already  what  counsel  you  would  give, \\nBoromir,’  said  Frodo.  ‘And  it  would  seem  like  wisdom  but \\nfor  the  warning  of  my  heart.’ \\n\\nWarning?  Warning  against  what?’  said  Boromir  sharply. \\n\\n‘Against  delay.  Against  the  way  that  seems  easier.  Against \\nrefusal  of  the  burden  that  is  laid  on  me.  Against  -  well,  if  it \\nmust  be  said,  against  trust  in  the  strength  and  truth  of  Men.’ \\n\\n‘Yet  that  strength  has  long  protected  you  far  away  in  your \\nlittle  country,  though  you  knew  it  not.’ \\n\\n‘I  do  not  doubt  the  valour  of  your  people.  But  the  world  is \\nchanging.  The  walls  of  Minas  Tirith  may  be  strong,  but  they \\nare  not  strong  enough.  If  they  fail,  what  then?’ \\n\\n‘We  shall  fall  in  battle  valiantly.  Yet  there  is  still  hope  that \\nthey  will  not  fail.’ \\n\\n‘No  hope  while  the  Ring  lasts,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘Ah!  The  Ring!’  said  Boromir,  his  eyes  lighting.  ‘The  Ring! \\nIs  it  not  a  strange  fate  that  we  should  suffer  so  much  fear  and \\ndoubt  for  so  small  a  thing?  So  small  a  thing!  And  I  have  seen \\nit  only  for  an  instant  in  the  house  of  Elrond.  Could  I  not  have \\na  sight  of  it  again?’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  BREAKING  OF  THE  FELLOWSHIP  519 \\n\\nFrodo  looked  up.  His  heart  went  suddenly  cold.  He  caught \\nthe  strange  gleam  in  Boromir’s  eyes,  yet  his  face  was  still  kind \\nand  friendly.  ‘It  is  best  that  it  should  lie  hidden,’  he  answered. \\n\\n‘As  you  wish.  I  care  not,’  said  Boromir.  ‘Yet  may  I  not \\neven  speak  of  it?  For  you  seem  ever  to  think  only  of  its  power \\nin  the  hands  of  the  Enemy:  of  its  evil  uses  not  of  its  good. \\nThe  world  is  changing,  you  say.  Minas  Tirith  will  fall,  if  the \\nRing  lasts.  But  why?  Certainly,  if  the  Ring  were  with  the \\nEnemy.  But  why,  if  it  were  with  us?’ \\n\\n‘Were  you  not  at  the  Council?’  answered  Frodo.  ‘Because \\nwe  cannot  use  it,  and  what  is  done  with  it  turns  to  evil.’ \\n\\nBoromir  got  up  and  walked  about  impatiently.  ‘So  you  go \\non,’  he  cried.  ‘Gandalf,  Elrond  -  all  these  folk  have  taught \\nyou  to  say  so.  For  themselves  they  may  be  right.  These  elves \\nand  half-elves  and  wizards,  they  would  come  to  grief  perhaps. \\nYet  often  I  doubt  if  they  are  wise  and  not  merely  timid.  But \\neach  to  his  own  kind.  True-hearted  Men,  they  will  not  be \\ncorrupted.  We  of  Minas  Tirith  have  been  staunch  through \\nlong  years  of  trial.  We  do  not  desire  the  power  of  wizard- \\nlords,  only  strength  to  defend  ourselves,  strength  in  a  just \\ncause.  And  behold!  in  our  need  chance  brings  to  light  the \\nRing  of  Power.  It  is  a  gift,  I  say;  a  gift  to  the  foes  of  Mordor. \\nIt  is  mad  not  to  use  it,  to  use  the  power  of  the  Enemy  against \\nhim.  The  fearless,  the  ruthless,  these  alone  will  achieve  vic¬ \\ntory.  What  could  not  a  warrior  do  in  this  hour,  a  great  leader? \\nWhat  could  not  Aragorn  do?  Or  if  he  refuses,  why  not \\nBoromir?  The  Ring  would  give  me  power  of  Command. \\nHow  I  would  drive  the  hosts  of  Mordor,  and  all  men  would \\nflock  to  my  banner!’ \\n\\nBoromir  strode  up  and  down,  speaking  ever  more  loudly. \\nAlmost  he  seemed  to  have  forgotten  Frodo,  while  his  talk \\ndwelt  on  walls  and  weapons,  and  the  mustering  of  men;  and \\nhe  drew  plans  for  great  alliances  and  glorious  victories  to  be; \\nand  he  cast  down  Mordor,  and  became  himself  a  mighty \\nking,  benevolent  and  wise.  Suddenly  he  stopped  and  waved \\nhis  arms. \\n\\n‘And  they  tell  us  to  throw  it  away!’  he  cried.  ‘I  do  not  say \\n\\n\\n520 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\ndestroy  it.  That  might  be  well,  if  reason  could  show  any  hope \\nof  doing  so.  It  does  not.  The  only  plan  that  is  proposed  to \\nus  is  that  a  halfling  should  walk  blindly  into  Mordor  and \\noffer  the  Enemy  every  chance  of  recapturing  it  for  himself. \\nFolly! \\n\\n‘Surely  you  see  it,  my  friend?’  he  said,  turning  now  sud¬ \\ndenly  to  Frodo  again.  ‘You  say  that  you  are  afraid.  If  it  is  so, \\nthe  boldest  should  pardon  you.  But  is  it  not  really  your  good \\nsense  that  revolts?’ \\n\\n‘No,  I  am  afraid,’  said  Frodo.  ‘Simply  afraid.  But  I  am  glad \\nto  have  heard  you  speak  so  fully.  My  mind  is  clearer  now.’ \\n\\n‘Then  you  will  come  to  Minas  Tirith?’  cried  Boromir.  His \\neyes  were  shining  and  his  face  eager. \\n\\n‘You  misunderstand  me,’  said  Frodo. \\n\\n‘But  you  will  come,  at  least  for  a  while?’  Boromir  persisted. \\n‘My  city  is  not  far  now;  and  it  is  little  further  from  there  to \\nMordor  than  from  here.  We  have  been  long  in  the  wilderness, \\nand  you  need  news  of  what  the  Enemy  is  doing  before  you \\nmake  a  move.  Come  with  me,  Frodo,’  he  said.  ‘You  need  rest \\nbefore  your  venture,  if  go  you  must.’  He  laid  his  hand  on  the \\nhobbit’s  shoulder  in  friendly  fashion;  but  Frodo  felt  the  hand \\ntrembling  with  suppressed  excitement.  He  stepped  quickly \\naway,  and  eyed  with  alarm  the  tall  Man,  nearly  twice  his \\nheight  and  many  times  his  match  in  strength. \\n\\n‘Why  are  you  so  unfriendly?’  said  Boromir.  ‘I  am  a  true \\nman,  neither  thief  nor  tracker.  I  need  your  Ring:  that  you \\nknow  now;  but  I  give  you  my  word  that  I  do  not  desire  to \\nkeep  it.  Will  you  not  at  least  let  me  make  trial  of  my  plan? \\nLend  me  the  Ring!’ \\n\\n‘No!  no!’  cried  Frodo.  ‘The  Council  laid  it  upon  me  to \\nbear  it.’ \\n\\n‘It  is  by  our  own  folly  that  the  Enemy  will  defeat  us,’  cried \\nBoromir.  ‘How  it  angers  me!  Fool!  Obstinate  fool!  Running \\nwilfully  to  death  and  ruining  our  cause.  If  any  mortals  have \\nclaim  to  the  Ring,  it  is  the  men  of  Numenor,  and  not \\nHalflings.  It  is  not  yours  save  by  unhappy  chance.  It  might \\nhave  been  mine.  It  should  be  mine.  Give  it  to  me!’ \\n\\n\\nTHE  BREAKING  OF  THE  FELLOWSHIP  5 21 \\n\\nFrodo  did  not  answer,  but  moved  away  till  the  great  flat \\nstone  stood  between  them.  ‘Come,  come,  my  friend!’  said \\nBoromir  in  a  softer  voice.  ‘Why  not  get  rid  of  it?  Why  not  be \\nfree  of  your  doubt  and  fear?  You  can  lay  the  blame  on  me, \\nif  you  will.  You  can  say  that  I  was  too  strong  and  took  it  by \\nforce.  For  I  am  too  strong  for  you,  halfling,’  he  cried;  and \\nsuddenly  he  sprang  over  the  stone  and  leaped  at  Frodo.  His \\nfair  and  pleasant  face  was  hideously  changed;  a  raging  fire \\nwas  in  his  eyes. \\n\\nFrodo  dodged  aside  and  again  put  the  stone  between  them. \\nThere  was  only  one  thing  he  could  do:  trembling  he  pulled \\nout  the  Ring  upon  its  chain  and  quickly  slipped  it  on  his \\nfinger,  even  as  Boromir  sprang  at  him  again.  The  Man \\ngasped,  stared  for  a  moment  amazed,  and  then  ran  wildly \\nabout,  seeking  here  and  there  among  the  rocks  and  trees. \\n\\n‘Miserable  trickster!’  he  shouted.  ‘Let  me  get  my  hands  on \\nyou!  Now  I  see  your  mind.  You  will  take  the  Ring  to  Sauron \\nand  sell  us  all.  You  have  only  waited  your  chance  to  leave  us \\nin  the  lurch.  Curse  you  and  all  halflings  to  death  and  dark¬ \\nness!’  Then,  catching  his  foot  on  a  stone,  he  fell  sprawling \\nand  lay  upon  his  face.  For  a  while  he  was  as  still  as  if  his  own \\ncurse  had  struck  him  down;  then  suddenly  he  wept. \\n\\nHe  rose  and  passed  his  hand  over  his  eyes,  dashing  away \\nthe  tears.  ‘What  have  I  said?’  he  cried.  What  have  I  done? \\nFrodo,  Frodo!’  he  called.  ‘Come  back!  A  madness  took  me, \\nbut  it  has  passed.  Come  back!’ \\n\\nThere  was  no  answer.  Frodo  did  not  even  hear  his  cries. \\nHe  was  already  far  away,  leaping  blindly  up  the  path  to  the \\nhill-top.  Terror  and  grief  shook  him,  seeing  in  his  thought \\nthe  mad  fierce  face  of  Boromir,  and  his  burning  eyes. \\n\\nSoon  he  came  out  alone  on  the  summit  of  Amon  Hen,  and \\nhalted,  gasping  for  breath.  He  saw  as  through  a  mist  a  wide \\nflat  circle,  paved  with  mighty  flags,  and  surrounded  with  a \\ncrumbling  battlement;  and  in  the  middle,  set  upon  four \\ncarven  pillars,  was  a  high  seat,  reached  by  a  stair  of  many \\nsteps.  Up  he  went  and  sat  upon  the  ancient  chair,  feeling  like \\n\\n\\n522  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\na  lost  child  that  had  clambered  upon  the  throne  of  mountain- \\nkings. \\n\\nAt  first  he  could  see  little.  He  seemed  to  be  in  a  world  of \\nmist  in  which  there  were  only  shadows:  the  Ring  was  upon \\nhim.  Then  here  and  there  the  mist  gave  way  and  he  saw \\nmany  visions:  small  and  clear  as  if  they  were  under  his  eyes \\nupon  a  table,  and  yet  remote.  There  was  no  sound,  only \\nbright  living  images.  The  world  seemed  to  have  shrunk  and \\nfallen  silent.  He  was  sitting  upon  the  Seat  of  Seeing,  on  Amon \\nHen,  the  Hill  of  the  Eye  of  the  Men  of  Numenor.  Eastward \\nhe  looked  into  wide  uncharted  lands,  nameless  plains,  and \\nforests  unexplored.  Northward  he  looked,  and  the  Great \\nRiver  lay  like  a  ribbon  beneath  him,  and  the  Misty  Mountains \\nstood  small  and  hard  as  broken  teeth.  Westward  he  looked \\nand  saw  the  broad  pastures  of  Rohan;  and  Orthanc,  the \\npinnacle  of  Isengard,  like  a  black  spike.  Southward  he \\nlooked,  and  below  his  very  feet  the  Great  River  curled  like  a \\ntoppling  wave  and  plunged  over  the  falls  of  Rauros  into  a \\nfoaming  pit;  a  glimmering  rainbow  played  upon  the  fume. \\nAnd  Ethir  Anduin  he  saw,  the  mighty  delta  of  the  River,  and \\nmyriads  of  sea-birds  whirling  like  a  white  dust  in  the  sun, \\nand  beneath  them  a  green  and  silver  sea,  rippling  in  endless \\nlines. \\n\\nBut  everywhere  he  looked  he  saw  the  signs  of  war.  The \\nMisty  Mountains  were  crawling  like  anthills:  ores  were  issuing \\nout  of  a  thousand  holes.  Under  the  boughs  of  Mirkwood \\nthere  was  deadly  strife  of  Elves  and  Men  and  fell  beasts.  The \\nland  of  the  Beornings  was  aflame;  a  cloud  was  over  Moria; \\nsmoke  rose  on  the  borders  of  Lorien. \\n\\nHorsemen  were  galloping  on  the  grass  of  Rohan;  wolves \\npoured  from  Isengard.  From  the  havens  of  Harad  ships  of \\nwar  put  out  to  sea;  and  out  of  the  East  Men  were  moving \\nendlessly:  swordsmen,  spearmen,  bowmen  upon  horses, \\nchariots  of  chieftains  and  laden  wains.  All  the  power  of  the \\nDark  Lord  was  in  motion.  Then  turning  south  again  he  beheld \\nMinas  Tirith.  Far  away  it  seemed,  and  beautiful:  white -walled, \\nmany-towered,  proud  and  fair  upon  its  mountain-seat;  its \\n\\n\\nTHE  BREAKING  OF  THE  FELLOWSHIP  523 \\n\\nbattlements  glittered  with  steel,  and  its  turrets  were  bright  with \\nmany  banners.  Hope  leaped  in  his  heart.  But  against  Minas \\nTirith  was  set  another  fortress,  greater  and  more  strong. \\nThither,  eastward,  unwilling  his  eye  was  drawn.  It  passed \\nthe  ruined  bridges  of  Osgiliath,  the  grinning  gates  of  Minas \\nMorgul,  and  the  haunted  Mountains,  and  it  looked  upon \\nGorgoroth,  the  valley  of  terror  in  the  Land  of  Mordor.  Dark¬ \\nness  lay  there  under  the  Sun.  Fire  glowed  amid  the  smoke. \\nMount  Doom  was  burning,  and  a  great  reek  rising.  Then \\nat  last  his  gaze  was  held:  wall  upon  wall,  battlement  upon \\nbattlement,  black,  immeasurably  strong,  mountain  of  iron, \\ngate  of  steel,  tower  of  adamant,  he  saw  it:  Barad-dur,  Fortress \\nof  Sauron.  All  hope  left  him. \\n\\nAnd  suddenly  he  felt  the  Eye.  There  was  an  eye  in  the \\nDark  Tower  that  did  not  sleep.  He  knew  that  it  had  become \\naware  of  his  gaze.  A  fierce  eager  will  was  there.  It  leaped \\ntowards  him;  almost  like  a  finger  he  felt  it,  searching  for  him. \\nVery  soon  it  would  nail  him  down,  know  just  exactly  where \\nhe  was.  Amon  Lhaw  it  touched.  It  glanced  upon  Tol  Brandir \\n-  he  threw  himself  from  the  seat,  crouching,  covering  his \\nhead  with  his  grey  hood. \\n\\nHe  heard  himself  crying  out:  Never,  never!  Or  was  it:  Verily \\nI  come,  I  come  to  you ?  He  could  not  tell.  Then  as  a  flash  from \\nsome  other  point  of  power  there  came  to  his  mind  another \\nthought:  Take  it  off!  Take  it  off!  Fool,  take  it  off!  Take  off  the \\nRing! \\n\\nThe  two  powers  strove  in  him.  For  a  moment,  perfectly \\nbalanced  between  their  piercing  points,  he  writhed,  tor¬ \\nmented.  Suddenly  he  was  aware  of  himself  again,  Frodo, \\nneither  the  Voice  nor  the  Eye:  free  to  choose,  and  with  one \\nremaining  instant  in  which  to  do  so.  He  took  the  Ring  off  his \\nfinger.  He  was  kneeling  in  clear  sunlight  before  the  high  seat. \\nA  black  shadow  seemed  to  pass  like  an  arm  above  him;  it \\nmissed  Amon  Hen  and  groped  out  west,  and  faded.  Then  all \\nthe  sky  was  clean  and  blue  and  birds  sang  in  every  tree. \\n\\nFrodo  rose  to  his  feet.  A  great  weariness  was  on  him,  but \\nhis  will  was  firm  and  his  heart  lighter.  He  spoke  aloud  to \\n\\n\\n524  THE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\nhimself.  ‘I  will  do  now  what  I  must,’  he  said.  ‘This  at  least  is \\nplain:  the  evil  of  the  Ring  is  already  at  work  even  in  the \\nCompany,  and  the  Ring  must  leave  them  before  it  does  more \\nharm.  I  will  go  alone.  Some  I  cannot  trust,  and  those  I  can \\ntrust  are  too  dear  to  me:  poor  old  Sam,  and  Merry  and \\nPippin.  Strider,  too:  his  heart  yearns  for  Minas  Tirith,  and \\nhe  will  be  needed  there,  now  Boromir  has  fallen  into  evil.  I \\nwill  go  alone.  At  once.’ \\n\\nHe  went  quickly  down  the  path  and  came  back  to  the  lawn \\nwhere  Boromir  had  found  him.  Then  he  halted,  listening.  He \\nthought  he  could  hear  cries  and  calls  from  the  woods  near \\nthe  shore  below. \\n\\n‘They’ll  be  hunting  for  me,’  he  said.  ‘I  wonder  how  long  I \\nhave  been  away.  Hours,  I  should  think.’  He  hesitated.  ‘What \\ncan  I  do?’  he  muttered.  ‘I  must  go  now  or  I  shall  never  go.  I \\nshan’t  get  a  chance  again.  I  hate  leaving  them,  and  like  this \\nwithout  any  explanation.  But  surely  they  will  understand. \\nSam  will.  And  what  else  can  I  do?’ \\n\\nSlowly  he  drew  out  the  Ring  and  put  it  on  once  more.  He \\nvanished  and  passed  down  the  hill,  less  than  a  rustle  of  the \\nwind. \\n\\nThe  others  remained  long  by  the  river-side.  For  some  time \\nthey  had  been  silent,  moving  restlessly  about;  but  now  they \\nwere  sitting  in  a  circle,  and  they  were  talking.  Every  now  and \\nagain  they  made  efforts  to  speak  of  other  things,  of  their \\nlong  road  and  many  adventures;  they  questioned  Aragorn \\nconcerning  the  realm  of  Gondor  and  its  ancient  history,  and \\nthe  remnants  of  its  great  works  that  could  still  be  seen  in  this \\nstrange  border-land  of  the  Emyn  Muil:  the  stone  kings  and \\nthe  seats  of  Lhaw  and  Hen,  and  the  great  Stair  beside  the \\nfalls  of  Rauros.  But  always  their  thoughts  and  words  strayed \\nback  to  Frodo  and  the  Ring.  What  would  Frodo  choose  to \\ndo?  Why  was  he  hesitating? \\n\\n‘He  is  debating  which  course  is  the  most  desperate,  I  think,’ \\nsaid  Aragorn.  ‘And  well  he  may.  It  is  now  more  hopeless  than \\never  for  the  Company  to  go  east,  since  we  have  been  tracked \\n\\n\\nTHE  BREAKING  OF  THE  FELLOWSHIP  525 \\n\\nby  Gollum,  and  must  fear  that  the  secret  of  our  journey  is \\nalready  betrayed.  But  Minas  Tirith  is  no  nearer  to  the  Fire \\nand  the  destruction  of  the  Burden. \\n\\n‘We  may  remain  there  for  a  while  and  make  a  brave  stand; \\nbut  the  Lord  Denethor  and  all  his  men  cannot  hope  to  do \\nwhat  even  Elrond  said  was  beyond  his  power:  either  to  keep \\nthe  Burden  secret,  or  to  hold  off  the  full  might  of  the  Enemy \\nwhen  he  comes  to  take  it.  Which  way  would  any  of  us  choose \\nin  Frodo’s  place?  I  do  not  know.  Now  indeed  we  miss \\nGandalf  most.’ \\n\\n‘Grievous  is  our  loss,’  said  Legolas.  ‘Yet  we  must  needs \\nmake  up  our  minds  without  his  aid.  Why  cannot  we  decide, \\nand  so  help  Frodo?  Let  us  call  him  back  and  then  vote!  I \\nshould  vote  for  Minas  Tirith.’ \\n\\n‘And  so  should  I,’  said  Gimli.  We,  of  course,  were  only \\nsent  to  help  the  Bearer  along  the  road,  to  go  no  further  than \\nwe  wished;  and  none  of  us  is  under  any  oath  or  command  to \\nseek  Mount  Doom.  Flard  was  my  parting  from  Lothlorien. \\nYet  I  have  come  so  far,  and  I  say  this:  now  we  have  reached \\nthe  last  choice,  it  is  clear  to  me  that  I  cannot  leave  Frodo.  I \\nwould  choose  Minas  Tirith,  but  if  he  does  not,  then  I  follow \\nhim.’ \\n\\n‘And  I  too  will  go  with  him,’  said  Legolas.  ‘It  would  be \\nfaithless  now  to  say  farewell.’ \\n\\n‘It  would  indeed  be  a  betrayal,  if  we  all  left  him,’  said \\nAragorn.  ‘But  if  he  goes  east,  then  all  need  not  go  with  him; \\nnor  do  I  think  that  all  should.  That  venture  is  desperate:  as \\nmuch  so  for  eight  as  for  three  or  two,  or  one  alone.  If  you \\nwould  let  me  choose,  then  I  should  appoint  three  com¬ \\npanions:  Sam,  who  could  not  bear  it  otherwise;  and  Gimli; \\nand  myself.  Boromir  will  return  to  his  own  city,  where  his \\nfather  and  his  people  need  him;  and  with  him  the  others \\nshould  go,  or  at  least  Meriadoc  and  Peregrin,  if  Legolas  is \\nnot  willing  to  leave  us.’ \\n\\n‘That  won’t  do  at  all!’  cried  Merry.  ‘We  can’t  leave  Frodo! \\nPippin  and  I  always  intended  to  go  wherever  he  went,  and \\nwe  still  do.  But  we  did  not  realize  what  that  would  mean.  It \\n\\n\\n526 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nseemed  different  so  far  away,  in  the  Shire  or  in  Rivendell.  It \\nwould  be  mad  and  cruel  to  let  Frodo  go  to  Mordor.  Why \\ncan’t  we  stop  him?’ \\n\\nWe  must  stop  him,’  said  Pippin.  ‘And  that  is  what  he  is \\nworrying  about,  I  am  sure.  He  knows  we  shan’t  agree  to  his \\ngoing  east.  And  he  doesn’t  like  to  ask  anyone  to  go  with  him, \\npoor  old  fellow.  Imagine  it:  going  off  to  Mordor  alone!’ \\nPippin  shuddered.  ‘But  the  dear  silly  old  hobbit,  he  ought  to \\nknow  that  he  hasn’t  got  to  ask.  He  ought  to  know  that  if  we \\ncan’t  stop  him,  we  shan’t  leave  him.’ \\n\\n‘Begging  your  pardon,’  said  Sam.  ‘I  don’t  think  you  under¬ \\nstand  my  master  at  all.  He  isn’t  hesitating  about  which  way \\nto  go.  Of  course  not!  What’s  the  good  of  Minas  Tirith \\nanyway?  To  him,  I  mean,  begging  your  pardon,  Master \\nBoromir,’  he  added,  and  turned.  It  was  then  that  they  dis¬ \\ncovered  that  Boromir,  who  at  first  had  been  sitting  silent  on \\nthe  outside  of  the  circle,  was  no  longer  there. \\n\\n‘Now  where’s  he  got  to?’  cried  Sam,  looking  worried.  ‘He’s \\nbeen  a  bit  queer  lately,  to  my  mind.  But  anyway  he’s  not  in \\nthis  business.  He’s  off  to  his  home,  as  he  always  said;  and  no \\nblame  to  him.  But  Mr.  Frodo,  he  knows  he’s  got  to  find  the \\nCracks  of  Doom,  if  he  can.  But  he’s  afraid.  Now  it’s  come  to \\nthe  point,  he’s  just  plain  terrified.  That’s  what  his  trouble  is. \\nOf  course  he’s  had  a  bit  of  schooling,  so  to  speak  -  we  all \\nhave  -  since  we  left  home,  or  he’d  be  so  terrified  he’d  just  fling \\nthe  Ring  in  the  River  and  bolt.  But  he’s  still  too  frightened  to \\nstart.  And  he  isn’t  worrying  about  us  either:  whether  we’ll  go \\nalong  with  him  or  no.  He  knows  we  mean  to.  That’s  another \\nthing  that’s  bothering  him.  If  he  screws  himself  up  to  go,  he’ll \\nwant  to  go  alone.  Mark  my  words!  We’re  going  to  have \\ntrouble  when  he  comes  back.  For  he’ll  screw  himself  up  all \\nright,  as  sure  as  his  name’s  Baggins.’ \\n\\n‘I  believe  you  speak  more  wisely  than  any  of  us,  Sam,’  said \\nAragorn.  ‘And  what  shall  we  do,  if  you  prove  right?’ \\n\\n‘Stop  him!  Don’t  let  him  go!’  cried  Pippin. \\n\\n‘I  wonder?’  said  Aragorn.  ‘He  is  the  Bearer,  and  the  fate \\nof  the  Burden  is  on  him.  I  do  not  think  that  it  is  our  part  to \\n\\n\\nTHE  BREAKING  OF  THE  FELLOWSHIP  527 \\n\\ndrive  him  one  way  or  the  other.  Nor  do  I  think  that  we  should \\nsucceed,  if  we  tried.  There  are  other  powers  at  work  far \\nstronger.’ \\n\\n‘Well,  I  wish  Frodo  would  “screw  himself  up”  and  come \\nback,  and  let  us  get  it  over,’  said  Pippin.  ‘This  waiting  is \\nhorrible!  Surely  the  time  is  up?’ \\n\\n‘Yes,’  said  Aragorn.  ‘The  hour  is  long  passed.  The  morning \\nis  wearing  away.  We  must  call  for  him.’ \\n\\nAt  that  moment  Boromir  reappeared.  He  came  out  from \\nthe  trees  and  walked  towards  them  without  speaking.  His  face \\nlooked  grim  and  sad.  He  paused  as  if  counting  those  that \\nwere  present,  and  then  sat  down  aloof,  with  his  eyes  on  the \\nground. \\n\\nWhere  have  you  been,  Boromir?’  asked  Aragorn.  ‘Have \\nyou  seen  Frodo?’ \\n\\nBoromir  hesitated  for  a  second.  ‘Yes,  and  no,’  he  answered \\nslowly.  ‘Yes:  I  found  him  some  way  up  the  hill,  and  I  spoke \\nto  him.  I  urged  him  to  come  to  Minas  Tirith  and  not  to  go \\neast.  I  grew  angry  and  he  left  me.  He  vanished.  I  have  never \\nseen  such  a  thing  happen  before,  though  I  have  heard  of  it \\nin  tales.  He  must  have  put  the  Ring  on.  I  could  not  find  him \\nagain.  I  thought  he  would  return  to  you.’ \\n\\n‘Is  that  all  that  you  have  to  say?’  said  Aragorn,  looking  hard \\nand  not  too  kindly  at  Boromir. \\n\\n‘Yes,’  he  answered.  ‘I  will  say  no  more  yet.’ \\n\\n‘This  is  bad!’  cried  Sam,  jumping  up.  ‘I  don’t  know  what \\nthis  Man  has  been  up  to.  Why  should  Mr.  Frodo  put  the \\nthing  on?  He  didn’t  ought  to  have;  and  if  he  has,  goodness \\nknows  what  may  have  happened!’ \\n\\n‘But  he  wouldn’t  keep  it  on,’  said  Merry.  ‘Not  when  he \\nhad  escaped  the  unwelcome  visitor,  like  Bilbo  used  to.’ \\n\\n‘But  where  did  he  go?  Where  is  he?’  cried  Pippin.  ‘He’s \\nbeen  away  ages  now.’ \\n\\n‘How  long  is  it  since  you  saw  Frodo  last,  Boromir?’  asked \\nAragorn. \\n\\n‘Half  an  hour,  maybe,’  he  answered.  ‘Or  it  might  be  an \\n\\n\\n528 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nhour.  I  have  wandered  for  some  time  since.  I  do  not  know!  I \\ndo  not  know!’  He  put  his  head  in  his  hands,  and  sat  as  if \\nbowed  with  grief. \\n\\n‘An  hour  since  he  vanished!’  shouted  Sam.  ‘We  must  try \\nand  find  him  at  once.  Come  on!’ \\n\\n‘Wait  a  moment!’  cried  Aragorn.  ‘We  must  divide  up  into \\npairs,  and  arrange  -  here,  hold  on!  Wait!’ \\n\\nIt  was  no  good.  They  took  no  notice  of  him.  Sam  had \\ndashed  off  first.  Merry  and  Pippin  had  followed,  and  were \\nalready  disappearing  westward  into  the  trees  by  the  shore, \\nshouting:  Frodo!  Frodo!  in  their  clear,  high,  hobbit-voices. \\nLegolas  and  Gimli  were  running.  A  sudden  panic  or  madness \\nseemed  to  have  fallen  on  the  Company. \\n\\n‘We  shall  all  be  scattered  and  lost,’  groaned  Aragorn.  ‘Boro- \\nmir!  I  do  not  know  what  part  you  have  played  in  this  mischief, \\nbut  help  now!  Go  after  those  two  young  hobbits,  and  guard \\nthem  at  the  least,  even  if  you  cannot  find  Frodo.  Come  back \\nto  this  spot,  if  you  find  him,  or  any  traces  of  him.  I  shall \\nreturn  soon.’ \\n\\nAragorn  sprang  swiftly  away  and  went  in  pursuit  of  Sam. \\nJust  as  he  reached  the  little  lawn  among  the  rowans  he  over¬ \\ntook  him,  toiling  uphill,  panting  and  calling,  Frodo! \\n\\n‘Come  with  me,  Sam!’  he  said.  ‘None  of  us  should  be \\nalone.  There  is  mischief  about.  I  feel  it.  I  am  going  to  the \\ntop,  to  the  Seat  of  Amon  Hen,  to  see  what  may  be  seen.  And \\nlook!  It  is  as  my  heart  guessed,  Frodo  went  this  way.  Follow \\nme,  and  keep  your  eyes  open!’  He  sped  up  the  path. \\n\\nSam  did  his  best,  but  he  could  not  keep  up  with  Strider \\nthe  Ranger,  and  soon  fell  behind.  He  had  not  gone  far  before \\nAragorn  was  out  of  sight  ahead.  Sam  stopped  and  puffed. \\nSuddenly  he  clapped  his  hand  to  his  head. \\n\\n‘Whoa,  Sam  Gamgee!’  he  said  aloud.  ‘Your  legs  are  too \\nshort,  so  use  your  head!  Let  me  see  now!  Boromir  isn’t  lying, \\nthat’s  not  his  way;  but  he  hasn’t  told  us  everything.  Some¬ \\nthing  scared  Mr.  Frodo  badly.  He  screwed  himself  up  to  the \\npoint,  sudden.  He  made  up  his  mind  at  last  -  to  go.  Where \\n\\n\\nTHE  BREAKING  OF  THE  FELLOWSHIP  529 \\n\\nto?  Off  East.  Not  without  Sam?  Yes,  without  even  his  Sam. \\nThat’s  hard,  cruel  hard.’ \\n\\nSam  passed  his  hand  over  his  eyes,  brushing  away  the \\ntears.  ‘Steady,  Gamgee!’  he  said.  ‘Think,  if  you  can!  He  can’t \\nfly  across  rivers,  and  he  can’t  jump  waterfalls.  He’s  got  no \\ngear.  So  he’s  got  to  get  back  to  the  boats.  Back  to  the  boats! \\nBack  to  the  boats,  Sam,  like  lightning!’ \\n\\nSam  turned  and  bolted  back  down  the  path.  He  fell  and \\ncut  his  knees.  Up  he  got  and  ran  on.  He  came  to  the  edge  of \\nthe  lawn  of  Parth  Galen  by  the  shore,  where  the  boats  were \\ndrawn  up  out  of  the  water.  No  one  was  there.  There  seemed \\nto  be  cries  in  the  woods  behind,  but  he  did  not  heed  them. \\nHe  stood  gazing  for  a  moment,  stock-still,  gaping.  A  boat \\nwas  sliding  down  the  bank  all  by  itself.  With  a  shout  Sam \\nraced  across  the  grass.  The  boat  slipped  into  the  water. \\n\\n‘Coming,  Mr.  Frodo!  Coming!’  called  Sam,  and  flung  him¬ \\nself  from  the  bank,  clutching  at  the  departing  boat.  He  missed \\nit  by  a  yard.  With  a  cry  and  a  splash  he  fell  face  downward \\ninto  deep  swift  water.  Gurgling  he  went  under,  and  the  River \\nclosed  over  his  curly  head. \\n\\nAn  exclamation  of  dismay  came  from  the  empty  boat.  A \\npaddle  swirled  and  the  boat  put  about.  Frodo  was  just  in \\ntime  to  grasp  Sam  by  the  hair  as  he  came  up,  bubbling  and \\nstruggling.  Fear  was  staring  in  his  round  brown  eyes. \\n\\n‘Up  you  come,  Sam  my  lad!’  said  Frodo.  ‘Now  take  my \\nhand!’ \\n\\n‘Save  me,  Mr.  Frodo!’  gasped  Sam.  ‘I’m  drownded.  I  can’t \\nsee  your  hand.’ \\n\\n‘Here  it  is.  Don’t  pinch,  lad!  I  won’t  let  you  go.  Tread \\nwater  and  don’t  flounder,  or  you’ll  upset  the  boat.  There \\nnow,  get  hold  of  the  side,  and  let  me  use  the  paddle!’ \\n\\nWith  a  few  strokes  Frodo  brought  the  boat  back  to  the \\nbank,  and  Sam  was  able  to  scramble  out,  wet  as  a  water-rat. \\nFrodo  took  off  the  Ring  and  stepped  ashore  again. \\n\\n‘Of  all  the  confounded  nuisances  you  are  the  worst,  Sam!’ \\nhe  said. \\n\\n‘Oh,  Mr.  Frodo,  that’s  hard!’  said  Sam  shivering.  ‘That’s \\n\\n\\n530 \\n\\n\\nTHE  FELLOWSHIP  OF  THE  RING \\n\\n\\nhard,  trying  to  go  without  me  and  all.  If  I  hadn’t  a  guessed \\nright,  where  would  you  be  now?’ \\n\\n‘Safely  on  my  way.’ \\n\\n‘Safely!’  said  Sam.  ‘All  alone  and  without  me  to  help  you? \\nI  couldn’t  have  a  borne  it,  it’d  have  been  the  death  of  me.’ \\n\\n‘It  would  be  the  death  of  you  to  come  with  me,  Sam,’  said \\nFrodo,  ‘and  I  could  not  have  borne  that.’ \\n\\n‘Not  as  certain  as  being  left  behind,’  said  Sam. \\n\\n‘But  I  am  going  to  Mordor.’ \\n\\n‘I  know  that  well  enough,  Mr.  Frodo.  Of  course  you  are. \\nAnd  I’m  coming  with  you.’ \\n\\n‘Now,  Sam,’  said  Frodo,  ‘don’t  hinder  me!  The  others  will \\nbe  coming  back  at  any  minute.  If  they  catch  me  here,  I  shall \\nhave  to  argue  and  explain,  and  I  shall  never  have  the  heart \\nor  the  chance  to  get  off.  But  I  must  go  at  once.  It’s  the  only \\nway.’ \\n\\n‘Of  course  it  is,’  answered  Sam.  ‘But  not  alone.  I’m  coming \\ntoo,  or  neither  of  us  isn’t  going.  I’ll  knock  holes  in  all  the \\nboats  first.’ \\n\\nFrodo  actually  laughed.  A  sudden  warmth  and  gladness \\ntouched  his  heart.  ‘Leave  one!’  he  said.  ‘We’ll  need  it.  But  you \\ncan’t  come  like  this  without  your  gear  or  food  or  anything.’ \\n\\n‘Just  hold  on  a  moment,  and  I’ll  get  my  stuff!’  cried  Sam \\neagerly.  ‘It’s  all  ready.  I  thought  we  should  be  off  today.’  He \\nrushed  to  the  camping  place,  fished  out  his  pack  from  the \\npile  where  Frodo  had  laid  it  when  he  emptied  the  boat  of  his \\ncompanions’  goods,  grabbed  a  spare  blanket,  and  some  extra \\npackages  of  food,  and  ran  back. \\n\\n‘So  all  my  plan  is  spoilt!’  said  Frodo.  ‘It  is  no  good  trying \\nto  escape  you.  But  I’m  glad,  Sam.  I  cannot  tell  you  how  glad. \\nCome  along!  It  is  plain  that  we  were  meant  to  go  together. \\nWe  will  go,  and  may  the  others  find  a  safe  road!  Strider  will \\nlook  after  them.  I  don’t  suppose  we  shall  see  them  again.’ \\n\\n‘Yet  we  may,  Mr.  Frodo.  We  may,’  said  Sam. \\n\\nSo  Frodo  and  Sam  set  off  on  the  last  stage  of  the  Quest \\ntogether.  Frodo  paddled  away  from  the  shore,  and  the  River \\n\\n\\nTHE  BREAKING  OF  THE  FELLOWSHIP  531 \\n\\nbore  them  swiftly  away,  down  the  western  arm,  and  past  the \\nfrowning  cliffs  of  Tol  Brandir.  The  roar  of  the  great  falls \\ndrew  nearer.  Even  with  such  help  as  Sam  could  give,  it  was \\nhard  work  to  pass  across  the  current  at  the  southward  end  of \\nthe  island  and  drive  the  boat  eastward  towards  the  far  shore. \\n\\nAt  length  they  came  to  land  again  upon  the  southern  slopes \\nof  Amon  Lhaw.  There  they  found  a  shelving  shore,  and  they \\ndrew  the  boat  out,  high  above  the  water,  and  hid  it  as  well  as \\nthey  could  behind  a  great  boulder.  Then  shouldering  their \\nburdens,  they  set  off,  seeking  a  path  that  would  bring  them \\nover  the  grey  hills  of  the  Emyn  Muil,  and  down  into  the  Land \\nof  Shadow. \\n\\n\\nMAPS \\n\\n\\nWORKS  BY  J.R.R.
