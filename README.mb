# RAG on Lord of the Rings

This project utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to delve into the rich text of Lord of the Rings. The text is divided into manageable chunks, which are then upserted into Pinecone, a vector database, to enable efficient retrieval. RAG is then employed to retrieve relevant information upon query.

## Project Structure

1. **Text Chunking**:
    - The text is divided into chunks using a custom chunking algorithm to ensure contextual integrity.
    
2. **Pinecone Upsert**:
    - The chunks are upserted into Pinecone to allow for vectorized querying.
    
3. **RAG Retrieval**:
    - Utilizing RAG to retrieve relevant chunks based on queries, enriching the responses with contextual insights from the text.

## Technologies Used

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: For retrieving contextual information.
- **Pinecone**: For vectorized data storage and retrieval.
- **Python**: For data processing and interaction with Pinecone and RAG.
